Common traits of best voted books on goodreads.com

Do books have traits in common that can signify popularity among consumers? To explore this question, i scrape book data and reviews, from books on both the best and worst voted book lists. I then use data such as the amount of ratings, the date of ratings left, and reviews from readers themselves, to visualise the difference. Dataplots made using matplot, along with wordclouds, and simple sentiment analysis using nltk.
