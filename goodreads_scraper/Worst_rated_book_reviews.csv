Besos entre líneas,AleJandra,"May 29, 2017",1.0,"1 Heteronormativa ESTRELLA

Voy a empezar esta reseña, con los puntos positivos.

1-Lo mas divertido del libro:

""Gracias a la Editorial Planeta por creer en nosotras y en esta novela. Es increíble comenzar este camino de la escritura en una editorial de tal prestigio.""

Esto me hizo reír tanto que casi me hago pipi. La escritora cree que Planeta es una Editorial de Prestigio.


2-Desde que publique que estaba leyendo este libro aquí en goodreads, he estado recibiendo muchas solicitudes de amistad.


Y párenle de contar, eso es lo único bueno del libro.

Quizá mi opinión sea un poco grosera y exagerada pero quiero asegurarles que no tengo nada en contra de las autoras, es mas ni siquiera las conozco, nunca he visto uno de sus videos o visitado sus blogs.

Desde hace varios meses he escuchado muchas cosas negativas referente a los libros hechos por youtubers, y como tal, mi curiosidad quería que les diera una oportunidad.

En especial las reseñas de , cada una de sus opiniones hicieron que aumentara mi curiosidad por esta nueva oleada de libros. Si les interesa pueden checar sus reseñas click .

Escogí este libro en especifico porque es romántico juvenil y eso me hizo pensar que seria ligero y divertido.

Pero no fue así, este libro me hizo hacer tantos corajes que casi me saco los ojos.

Si creían que After de Anna Todd es una novela cliché, pues este libro es cien veces peor.


Desde mi perspectiva este libro

La escritura es horrible, enserio nefasta. Palabras sin acentos, descripciones entre cortadas, diálogos sin sentido, con un vocabulario de un niño de 7 años. Descripciones recicladas y clichés. Y lo peor es que las escritoras dicen que tuvieron 2 editores que las ayudaron.

2 escritoras y 2 editores y aun así tenemos un libro con la frase:



Ese solo es un ejemplo, el libro esta lleno de errores como este.

Ahora hablando de la historia:

la protagonistas es una bloguera, que se convierte en youtubera, para compartir el amor por los libros.
Adivinen cuál es su genero favorito? Juvenil
Adivinen quién es su autora clasica favorita? Yep, Jane Austen
Adivinen que carrera va a estudiar? Literatura



Es egoísta, aniñada, inmadura, obsesiva, mentirosa, manipuladora, torpe, y tiene cero personalidad. Y sus actitudes no tenían ningún fuckin sentido.

Para empezar ella ha sufrido de todo, su madre murió cuando era niña, su padre esta discapacitado, su hermana casi muere a causa de la anorexia. Uno podría pensar que ella a madurado un poco o que al menos no fuera tan fuckin estúpida, pero no. Me parece un insulto la manera en que muestran la historia de su papá. Cuando alguien a quien amas muere, se aprende a valorara lo que nos queda. Para la prota, que aunque dicen que es muy fuerte, la verdad se la pasa cometiendo estupideces al por mayor y es tan fuckin egoísta que no me cabe en la cabeza porque las autoras desarrollaron un personaje de esa manera.

Emma solo ve a su papá una vez a la semana, aun así lo ignora, y se molesta cuando el quiere pasar tiempo con ella. Cuando lo va a visitar a la residencia donde vive, en vez de dedicarle tiempo se la pasa distraída buscando al chico que le gusta. Y no solo trata mal a su papá, a su tía, a la que le debe todo, se la pasa insultándola y quejándose de todo lo que ella hace, lo peor fue cuando manipula a su tía para que se preocupe por su hermana y de eso modo tener la casa a solas y ella se pueda agasajar a su novio.


, el ""galán"" de la historia, es un cliché andando. Es tan oscuro y diferente que lee a Charles Bukowski.
Su dichoso ""misterio"", fue la cosa mas predecible y anticlimática de toda la historia.


, es real que en España manejar alcoholizado no es un delito grave???
Por que acá donde vivo es, y si a eso le suman el asesinato. No me cabe en la cabeza que a Eric solo lo hayan puesto a hacer servicio comunitario.

el youtuber mexicano. Ok tenemos que dejar pasar el echo de que dice, , en cada oración. Porque aparentemente así hablamos todos los mexicanos. Si de verdad querían que nos la creyéramos que era mexicano le hubieran puesto un dialogo donde dijera , hubiera sido mas realista.

Esperen hay mas:





Entonces los mexicanos no conocemos la palabra vergüenza, o no sabemos lo que significa?????
Ademas ponen que México está en Sudamérica.
Aparte de que no saben escribir tampoco saben Geografia.


Y por supuesto Gabriel es una diva, mas diva que el personaje a quien llaman diva. Hace todo un drama porque la prota le regala un libro.

Porque pobrecito esta cansado de ser famoso, y andar de gira por España, y que todo el mundo crea que es increíble, inteligente y quieran ser como el. Fuckin drama queen.


Si yo fuera un blogger o youtuber me sentiría insultada por la manera en que este libro los retrata. Bueno este libro le falta al respeto a todos. A las personas discapacitadas, a las que sufren anorexia, a los lectores, a los latinos, y a cualquiera que gaste dinero en comprar este libro (que por cierto es uno de los ebooks mas caros que he visto).

Una de las escenas mas ridículas, que también me hizo reír mucho, es cuando la prota y sus amigas conocen a Jennifer L. Armentrout, o como ellas la llaman: .

Una de las amigas de Emma, de la cual ni siquera recuerdo el nombre, que es también amante de la ""literatura"", manda whatsapp con la ortografía de una niña de 5 años, la mayoria de veces no se les entendia nada.
Y hablando de los Whatsapp, al principio me molestaba mucho que los llamaran , pero luego vi que era un mero populismo, a lo que no le veo sentido es que en los primeros mensajes los llaman wasaps y después ya los ponen como whatsapp, porque no mantenerte fiel a lo que ya estabas escribiendo, que lo hayan cambiado me hace pensar que si fue un error de una de las autoras.

Y hasta aquí llego, ya no quiero seguir haciendo corajes, porque esto solo es la punta del iceberg, la historia tiene problemas mayores como la justificación de un intento de violación, pero ya no quiero ni pensar en ello. Solo quiero cerrar los ojos y hacer de cuenta que no leí este libro.



Hago responsable de este desastre de libro a Editorial Planeta, esta gentuza esta tan enfocada en vender libros que no les importa el contenido. No les importa que nos están entregando, solo les importa cuanto dinero les hace ganar. Y ni siquiera para vender libros son buenos, yo trate de comprar este libro y no esta en ninguna tienda virtual de mi país. Luego no se quejen de la piratería.


*******************************

Seguramente ustedes al igual que yo, ya estamos cansados de ver y hablar de este libro. Honestamente mi tiempo es demasiado valioso para seguirlo perdiendo en esto.
Pero no puedo dejar de mencionar las maniobras sucias que están utilizando para tratar de contrarrestar nuestra opinion. Sospechosamente, decenas de perfiles ""fantasmas"", han estado dándole 5 estrellas tratando de subir su calificación y likeando las reseñas positivas que hay (que ahora que lo pienso solo es una).



no pueden salvar este libro, y no, no es por nuestras reseñas, es porque la calidad de su historia es insalvable. Pasen la pagina y enfóquense en mejorar sus skills como escritoras."
Besos entre líneas,Eliza Rapsodia,"April 25, 2017",1.0,"0.5/5
¡MUY LARGA SORRY!

Empecé a leer este libro cuando mi amiga Nea lo estaba haciendo y me impulsó puramente la curiosidad de saber qué tal estaba. Así que Nea, this is for you. También es para mis dos Marías. Y para los bloggers y amigos que estuvimos leyendo el libro en paralelo y lo fuimos comentando en Twitter.

En el párrafo anterior puse la palabra ""libro"".





Emma es una jovencita que no tiene apellido y le encanta leer.  Vive en algún pueblo de España cerca a Madrid y su vida es demasiado dura. Cuando era niña su madre murió en un accidente automovilístico y su padre quedó bastante mal luego de eso. Desde entonces vive con su tía y ve a su padre los fines de semana porque lo tienen en una casa de reposo. y tiene un par de amigas que ve muy poco que también leen. Siendo así, es una buena niña y se refugia en la literatura y en su blog. Hasta que un día en una biblioteca escucha a alguien leyendo poesía de un tal """"""Bukowski"""""", declamada por un tipo que rellena muy bien las mangas de su camiseta. Y entonces, Emma le llama la atención el chico. Y ahí empieza todo.

A partir de este punto vamos a suponer que cuando Emma habla



Cundo empecé este libro y leí la primera frase del prólogo





 (Por cierto él se llama Jeffrey Marsh y tiene un Vine que es FABULOSO)

Mal vamos. El prólogo es de lo más cliché de película dominguera hecha para TV que te puedas imaginar. Además de que yo, por ejemplo, con seis años no recuerdo prácticamente nada de cosas que me pasaban. Sólo que me di un porrazo por treparme en una valla del jardín de mi casa

Entonces empezamos el libro con un grave detalle





Emma es perfectísima en todo sentido. Su tía no tiene queja de ella (que sólo se queja cuando le conviene a la historia) y su hermana Lys la adora porque le ayudó con la anorexia (luego hablamos de eso). Es una buena estudiante aunque no hace nada Pero hay una cosa. Tiene una perra llamada Zoe que pobrecita, Emma la llama ESTÚPIDA al principio del libro y se queda tan pancha. Por llamarse Emma ya parece que es inglesa o extranjera.

Pero no todo es bonito y florido en la vida de Emma.

TIENE UN PROBLEMA.
Que es 'Friki' y eso es TERRIBLE.



Emma seguramente no entenderá el meme de arriba Ser friki abarca mucho más que eso y es un término despectivo que abarca cantidad de cosas. Y eso es muy malo. Lo dice alguien que lleva una vida normal y

Aparte de tener un padre discapacitado y una vida durísima, Emma tiene tiempo para leer y llevar un blog que se llama La ventana de Emma. En él comenta sus lecturas.Y le encanta ir a librerías a mirar libros y leerlos. Y le encanta sobarlos. 

Y le encanta comentar los libros que lee.












En medio de una vida tan dura, con un padre que hay que bañarle una vez (o dos) en un fin de semana y una selectividad aproximándose tenemos a Emma SinApellido en una biblioteca leyendo literatura juvenil y un día escucha a alguien leyendo poemas de Bukowski. Si ese tipo norteamericano que le encantaba beber, hablar de mujeres y mierdas varias.



Miren EL HORROR:

Emma se arrima a ver quién es el dueño de esa voz (cual marinera a sireno) y lo que hace es interrumpir a un adonis chulero que se va a una biblioteca a leer poemas de Bukowski en voz alta  y de los teléfonos móviles que te puede echar de una patada si quiere






¿Qué cosas no?

Entonces, como imaginarán, nuestra protagonista Pero bueno, que después permite que ERIC ROMERO la siga, la sobe y la bese a escasos momentos de conocerla y más encima



Y así empieza Besos entre líneas.

Aparte de Cincuenta sombras de paleta-Grey, no había visto un libro que fueraMe contaron que el libro es un encargo por parte de la editorial y que seguramente sería un éxito desde su publicación (ya se sabe que se vendió como empanada de papa después de misa) porque ya sabemos que en nuestro mundo lo que llama la atención

¿Pero por qué Besos entre líneas es un libro equiparable con Grey?

1) La escritura



Este libro tiene una narrativa más plana que una carretera y es que está mal escrito. Se notan demasiado los cambios de tono entre las autoras y los errores sintácticos Se supone que los libros son corregidos primero por los autores, pasna a una revisión de un corrector o un editor. Adivinen quién no hizo su trabajo





Pues hay muchísimas partes así. NO hay descripciones de prácticamente nada. No hay descripciones del pueblo ni de la gente en general. Si las hay, son parcas y pobres. Ni siquiera se cómo Además de ésto hay una falta de detalles, de textura, de alma a esta narrativa que da pena ajena.

Y NO





""Pero somos Emma, Eric y Gabriel y somos los únicos en este libro que escriben bien en Whatsapp."" Me quedé un poco más ciega leyendo esto .



Esto sin duda es de lo peor del libro. No sólo es que Emma. Es que además es absolutamente egoísta e inconsistente como narradora, Sus acciones y sus actitudes son muy poco lógicas y tontas. Y más encima es una caradura y repelente de cuidado. Y miren que no pido identificarme con un personaje, pero es que tiene tan poca carne,

Todos los personajes parecen cortados de cartón de cereal He hecho una pequeña definición para muchos de ellos:
















Si Terry Crews se los cargara a todos no me importaría

Pero no nos olvidemos de Eric. Alias que pobrecito ha pasado por unas gordísimas en su vida. Pero es que es incluso PEOR que Emma en muchas cosas. No sólo no respeta a las mujeres sino que literalmente las manipula para que hagan lo que él quiere. Y los feos no merecen vivir en este libro porque son feos. Todos son bellos. Y es que el machismo en este libro es patente señores y lo peor es que si la protagonista no tiene dignidad que podemos exigirle....

Si te toca sin tu permiso te defiendes.

3) Los dramas

Este libro no se ha comido ni uno de los clichés adolescentes pero para variar, ha metido cantidad de dramas y situaciones difíciles. Pero que es lo peor señores:



Esto son problemas muy serios y es que no tienen peso en la trama y cuando se referencian es avergonzante. Simplemente se mencionan y luego se toman a modo de burla. Se del caso de una chica que conocía que la anorexia casi la mata y tardo meses en volver a su vida normal. Y si quería quedar embarazada es difícil Es un trastorno grave y si hablas de él investígalo un poco.

Esto también es sonrojante. Jamás sabremos bien qué le paso al padre de Emma en su cabeza y la protagonista no parece importarle un pimiento, ya que usa a su padre para ver a Eric y lo desatiende por la misma razón.

Solo son una salida de guión para que nos compadezcamos del protagonista y darle mucho más drama.

En este libro se descubre que Sandra es lesbiana porque le gustan los personajes femeninos en los libros. Qué risa todo.

4) El HAMOR



No señores no se lo están imaginando. Este libro tiene En tan pocas páginas y lo han metido para ser lo más forzado del mundo. Resulta que hay una BLC en Madrid y aparece un Booktuber mexicano MUY famoso que no tarda en caerle a Emma.

""



Si, claro. Entonces los colombianos también andamos piqueando gente que no conocemos hace unas horas y quién no se siente insultado cuando se burlan/parodian su forma de hablar. Qué loquillos que son los hombres de esta región del mundo. Y luego es peor porque casi que forza a Emma SinApellido para que tenga relaciones sexuales con él ""por diversión"". Vaya, que interesante todo. Y si pones atención sabrás en quién de la vida real se inspira este personaje. Lo que me lleva a lo siguiente.











Si creíamos que referenciar libros de literatura juvenil a veces en más de una página era poca cosa tenemos que tragar algo como eso. El libro está de opiniones de libros y pensamientos sobre libros juveniles. Se citan a Jane Austen y Bukowski como algo meramente anecdótico porque de resto TODOS los libros que lee la prota son buenos.

Incluso tenemos la escena ridícula donde una profesora ""mala"" dice que la literatura juvenil es basura y la protagonista muy dignay que seguramente leer esos libros no la hace más inteligente que los que leen juvenil.



Hay referencias de todo tipo como de Harry Potter, John Green, Cassandra Clare, Las ventajas de ser un maginado, Matilda, Divergente, La selección, Maggie Stiefvater, Los juegos del hambre, Matilda, Hachiko, La probabilidad estadística del amor a primera vista, Cuaderno para dos, Blue Jeans, Javier Ruescas, Prohibido y otra sarta que me da mucha pereza buscar. Porque abundan y son muy molestas.

Pero he mencionado Booktube antes ¿verdad? Emma se vuelve booktuber y de la noche a la mañana se vuelve famosilla. No es sólo que Emma no estudie NADA para pasar la selectividad y se la pase haciendo vídeos o en la calle con Eric, sino que hasta le va bien sin esforzarse. En serio cuando estudiaba tenia más concentración un pez globo ciego que ella.



Yo estudié latín y las declinaciones son difíciles pero

Y es que el libro tiene el capítulo más soporífero de la historia de algo que debería ser entretenido para los lectores. La BLC donde se menciona de forma eufemística Para la muestra un botón:






Y asi una cantidad de páginas de idas y venidas, golpeadas de nariz, Gabriel, drama, tragos y demás cosas



Las fans representadas en este libro

Pero luego de soportar tan pocas páginas pero tantos despropósitos, vamos a unas revelaciones que ya se sabían desde hace rato y Y supongo que se imaginarán cómo termina esta historia de ""amor"" de Emma SinApellido y Eric Romero, el malote de turno que SI TIENE apellido pero en el fondo es un alma sensible.



La única vez en la que Emma tenía algo de seso en el cerebro.





Luego de tanto que he dicho puede decir unas cositas.

Esto es un ""libro"" por encargo pero podrían haberlo hecho bien,
Mi perra (q.e.p.d)
Esto es un libro que promueve el machismo
NO a las Zoes maltratadas
Un caramelo que hay en tan pocas páginas.
.

Y a modo de conclusión:

Es malo en todos los sentidos. Lo aventaría en un apocalipsis zombie a algún muerto que quisiera comerme. Creo que el pobre moriría de indigestión si se lo tragara.

."
Besos entre líneas,Clara Cortés,"April 17, 2016",,"Empecé esta novela por la polémica y porque quería formarme mi propia opinión. Bueno, pues ya lo he hecho, y aquí está. Ni siquiera voy a poner puntuación, porque creo que lo que pienso ya ha quedado lo suficientemente claro por mis comentarios. Me parece que está más a nivel de fanfic que de novela, y podría haber mejorado muchísimo si alguien hubiera revisado los errores de estilo y las incoherencias (de argumento, de contexto, de personajes...), porque no habría estado mal. O tan mal. Sin embargo, y siento decirlo, este libro es un desastre.

No me voy a extender con cómo está escrito (mal, nada unificado) ni de ritmo (*rolleyes*) ni de la trama que no lleva a ninguna parte (*inserte el meme de la negra*), porque paso. Ya se ha dicho y volver sobre eso me parece un rollo. Además, estoy segurísima de que hay gente muchísimo más indicada que yo para hablar de esas cosas, porque no soy ninguna experta. Eso sí, me voy a centrar en la historia en sí, en las escenas, en las cosas que he leído. Porque hay muchas cosas que decir que están mal, y lo siento pero no puedo aguantarme.

Aviso: .

Para empezar, no solo creo que falta trabajar los personajes, sino que habría que haberse documentado un poco en cuanto a las enfermedades que tratan y lo que suponen tanto para los que las sufren como para los de su alrededor. Entiendo que en una historia hacen falta dramas en los que apoyarse (hola, soy yo, todas mis historias tienen drama por alguna parte y además del intenso), pero es que en este libro podrías quitar tranquilamente lo del padre, lo de la hermana y lo de la madre de Eric y el resto permanecería intacto. Emma seguiría siendo la misma, y la parte que para las autoras es claramente la más importante de su libro (el avance como bloguera de Emma y la relación con Eric) no se alteraría. Si te quieres apoyar en eso, por lo menos hazlo bien. Os juro que me ha parecido que ni las autoras tenían claro lo que le pasaba al padre, en plan, sí, bueno, no se puede bañar solo ni leer ni hablar, pero ya. Y lo de la anorexia que se cura milagrosamente después de que una niña de nueve años (que entiende perfectamente lo que es la anorexia, claro, porque si no es algo dificilísimo de entender para algunos adultos no lo va a ser para alguien de esa edad) llore junto a la cama de la hermana pidiéndole que por favor vuelva..., en fin. Me callo. El caso es que estás hablando de cosas muy serias, y tienen que tener una repercusión clara en la personalidad de la hija/hermana que ha tenido que vivir con las secuelas de aquello. ¿La tiene? No. Emma se comporta con su padre como si fuera un señor extraño a quien le han encargado cuidar y claramente se la suda que su hermana tuviera anorexia, porque la saluda con un «¿Has adelgazado?» y se queda tan ancha.

Se ve que Emma es una persona comprensiva y entregada, eh. Es una luchadora y responsable y “una empollona”. O a lo mejor eso último tampoco tanto, porque está en 2º de Bach y a) se salta clases para estar con el malote de turno, b) se pasa horas leyendo libros (muchos, libros, y te los dice todos) en vez de estudiar, c) pasa tardes enteras viendo vídeos de YT porque no debe tener nada más que hacer. Uhm, no hace tanto que hice 2º de Bach y no tenía tiempo ni para mear. Tendría que haberme contado su secreto.

PERO ESPERA, QUE EMMA SACA NOTAZAS EN LA PAU DESPUÉS DE HABER ESTADO TOCÁNDOSE EL PAPO TODO EL CURSO, SALIENDO CON MOTEROS Y LIÁNDOSE CON BOOKTUBERS. Olvidad el párrafo anterior, no he dicho nada. Chicas, dejad los estudios por un tío y otras distracciones, que total la Selectividad es muy poco importante y puedes sacar notazas estudiando dos días antes.

Por otra parte, está la relación de Eric y Emma. O mejor decir , término que he leído hace poco por ahí y me ha encantado. No tiene sentido ninguno. Para empezar, todos sus primeros encuentros son en plan mal (el de la biblioteca, el de la clase de literatura, el de la fiesta a lo americano). Se ha hablado ya de la escena de la hierba y que él la toquetea sin su permiso y cuando el poli le pregunta si hay algún problema ella dice que no, que todo está bien, pero aun así quiero hablar de ella; ¿soy la única a la que si se le acerca un desconocido le apartaría de un empujón preguntándole qué coño hace? En serio, pensadlo. Literalmente le acabas de ver hace cinco minutos. Me la suda que sea guapo. Es que es acoso, joder. Y te está toqueteando, casi besando. Qué me estás contando, tío.

Ah, por cierto. La tía le encuentra la hierba y se cabrea con ella, pero cuando la hermana le cuenta que “el poeta” es guapo se le pasa. SE LE PASA. PORQUE ES GUAPO.

En fin. El caso es que sus primeros encuentros son en ese plan y después el desaparece entre septiembre y abril (?????) y, al parecer, la vida de Emma y su familia no es lo suficientemente interesante sin Eric pululando por ahí como para hablar de ella. Él vuelve de repente, Emma está preocupadísima por él porque debe ser que en sus primeros encuentros fue amabilísimo con ella y le recuerda con cariño (pista: en realidad es que es ), y va a hablar con él. Pasan cosas en las que los dos están en su línea de antes, él la besa así porque why not y ya está enamorada. Da igual todo lo que ha pasado porque, como le dice un amigo de Eric a Emma, «Si se comporta así contigo es porque en el fondo le importas» (). Mira, no. Lo siento, pero no. Aunque da igual. Él sigue siendo borde con ella, Emma le cuenta el accidente de sus padres out of nothing (juro que estaban hablando de otra cosa y de repente ella se lo suelta así sin más, wtf) y en algún momento que debí perderme lo suyo se hace oficial, pero el caso es que pasa. Tralalá.

Oh, y luego está la primera vez que lo hacen, la primera vez de Emma. Es . O sea, sí, ella le coge un condón a la tía, pero no se dice que ella lo saque ni que él se lo ponga ni nada, porque oh ella se emociona demasiado y se calienta y en fin, la pasión del guapo de Eric. Ella le ha visto estar con varias chicas, chicas con las que está casi segura que Eric ha hecho cosas más allá que morrearse, y aun así decide que su primera vez con él va a ser sin protección porque debe ser que las ets son un mito. Bye.

Dos días después, cortan. Ni siquiera discuten nada, ella deja de hablarle y hale. Justo para que Emma pueda conocer a su booktuber mexicano favorito, por cierto, también de personalidad poco consistente (creo que es el tipo de chicos que le gustan a Emma, visto su historial) y salido directamente de una telenovela, güey. El chaval se hace mazo amigo suyo en una noche y al día siguiente le dice “VENGA, QUE COMO ME CONOZCO MADRID TE ACOMPAÑO A ESA ESTACIÓN QUE ESTÁ A TOMAR POR CULO” y, como todos los hombres que se ha cruzado Emma últimamente, la besa sin consentimiento. Como dice mi amiga Jasmina, . Sinceramente, no entiendo por qué se sigue romantizando tanto esto. No me entra en la cabeza. No es algo bonito, es incómodo y agresivo. Las chicas adolescentes no deberían estar esperando eso. ¿Por qué no puede empezar a verse más normal un «¿Puedo besarte?», «Sí»? Yo he vivido eso y, tío, es mucho más bonito. Se te ponen mariposas en el estómago y la anticipación y todas esas cosas que dice que siente Emma. Por no hablar de cuando ella empieza a tener dudas sobre Eric y cada vez que Gabriel la besa (y lo otro) se siente superincómoda, lo dice, pero no se aparta. . Que por cierto, sobre el ¿triángulo amoroso?, sin comentarios. Otra cosa que se fuerza para poner “trabas” en la relación de ellos dos; aparece porque sí y desaparece porque sí. Y ya está. Todo bien.

Detalles como que las puertas de los hospitales tiene una ventana para que veas al paciente (again, ¿en qué hospital de Madrid, por favor?), que una adolescente vaya al videoclub (¿no tienes Netflix, hija mía?) o lo de que al principio de curso monten una fiesta con DJ en el gimnasio del instituto (me pregunto si los vasos eran rojos y si había ponche) son cosas que, si se hubieran solucionado a tiempo, le habrían dado menos aspecto de fanfic-de-Wattpad. Son fallos de ambientación de primero de escritura, no sé. Y luego lo de la BLC y los libros que lee Emma. Dios. Tenía que haberme informado de a cuánto estaba la mención. Que lo haga una vez hace gracia, un par vale, pero ¿todo el rato? Venga ya.

Y ya por último: . Lo que hace que Eric sea un Chico Malo. Lo de que condujo borracho y tuvo un accidente en el que se mató su novia. Cuando Emma le dice «No es tu culpa», os juro que me he puesto a gritar. ¿CÓMO QUE , SI SE EMBORRACHÓ Y COGIÓ LA MOTO Y TUVO UN ACCIDENTE QUE LA MATÓ, QUÉ ME ESTÁS CONTANDO? Os juro que no me lo creo. Lo leía y me parecía imposible que alguien pudiera disculpar a alguien así, sobre todo después de que Emma repita una y otra vez que Eric es el tipo de persona que mató a su madre. No tiene puto sentido. Qué me estás contando.


En fin, no hay mucho más que decir. Lo he leído, como ya he dicho, porque quería tener mi propia opinión. Y aquí está. Siento si el tono que he usado ha ofendido a alguien, pero dentro de lo que cabe todo lo que digo me parece serio, fallos importantes. Si tanto hablamos de feminismo, historias tóxicas, tópicos y etc, tal vez deberíamos tener en cuenta ciertos puntos antes de sacar algunas cosas al mercado, que luego mucho criticamos otras novelas pero la nuestra no. Vamos a ser coherentes, por favor, y a revisar y aprender de los errores. A ver si va a ser que el emperador sí que está desnudo, ¿no?


PD: Ninguna profesora de literatura de instituto te va a decir que lo que lees es una mierda, ni que la literatura juvenil es para niños. Para empezar, es una profesora y qué es la literatura juvenil, aunque creas que no. Lo sabe. No ha nacido ayer. Segundo, entiende el término juvenil a la perfección, porque da clase a gente de 16-18 años. Si te manda leer es por otra cosa, no porque sea el único libro que conoce. Y, para acabar, . Le gusta que leas. Le gusta que te guste leer. No te va a decir que no lo hagas. En serio que no."
Besos entre líneas,Anna,"April 16, 2016",1.0,La prueba perfecta que leer mucho no te hace saber escribir.
Besos entre líneas,Fabián Tapia,"July 22, 2016",1.0,"Tras pocos días después de su publicación, la novela de las jóvenes Esme y May, ambas booktubers muy reputadas en España, “Besos entre líneas”, se ha convertido en Bestseller mundial y su rating sube y sube en la red Goodreads augurando una calidad sin precedentes en las novelas juveniles.
“Queríamos plasmar una relación amorosa auténtica, basada en el amor y el respeto y en los valores feministas que poseemos-expresaron las autoras-. Esperamos que existan más relaciones como éstas. Creemos que en definitiva le hubiera cambiado la vida a Virginia Woolf y a sus erradas concepciones del feminismo.”
La crítica no se ha hecho esperar. De hecho, las jóvenes han inspirado a varias celebridades, entre ellas a la joven Malala:
“Abrí mi canal de YouTube gracias a los valores culturales que me transmitió este libro. Me cambió la vida. Se lo regalaré a Emma Watson. Gracias chicas, ahorita les envío más bots”
Asimismo, el célebre escritor Paulo Coehlo abrirá su propio canal de Booktube. ¡Han leído bien!
“Gracias a los prácticos consejos de estas chicas, me he inspirado para abrir mi canal y compartir mis frases más célebres. Este libro es una revelación espiritual.”
Otras célebres escritoras han elogiado esta obra. Zoella Sugg sentencia:
“May dijo que mi libro, Girl Online era una soberana mierda a pesar de haberla co-escrito con alguien más adicional. Pero, who gives a fuck? Este libro me encantó.”
Anna Todd no se quedó atrás:
“Khe pareja tan maz emozionante. Su relazion me emoziono. Ez emocionante que tantaz emozionez me haian transmitido, pues ze tienen un rezpeto y un amor maz grande khe el de Hardin y Tessa. No lo kreia pozible”
La autora superventas de la trilogía “Cincuenta sombras de Grey”, emitió también su crítica, que fue la única desfavorable.
“Le falta más sexo y más faltas de ortografía para estar a mi nivel artístico”
La ópera prima de estas dos autoras trata sobre una chica blogger y que hace vídeos de libros para YouTube. Es única y especial y transmite lo genial y únicos y especiales que son los lectores hoy en día. Además, brindan consejos para ser booktuber, como éste que le sirvió mucho a Fa:
“No sabía cómo hacerle para prender mi cámara después de quedarse sin batería. La verdad qué chido libro. Me ayudó un buen”
Las autoras pretendían con su obra darle promoción a más booktubers con pocos suscriptores, como fue el caso de Malala, quien se mostró muy agradecida.
La calidad del libro no puede ser puesta en duda: cada segundo el rating sube en la plataforma Goodreads, tanto que planean cambiar el sistema de calificación de cinco estrellas a diez estrellas. Sobre su calidad habla Santiago Posteguillo:
“Ellas crean una gramática nueva, fresca, tanto así que Cortázar las envidiaría”

RESEÑA COMPLETA:"
Besos entre líneas,Josu Diamond,"March 12, 2016",4.0,"Una novela para los amantes de los libros, booktube y de las historias románticas contemporáneas. Acompaña a Emma en una lectura adictiva, ¡y no te enamores de Eric!

La primera novela conjunta de Esme y May es una historia fresca y divertida que sin duda me hizo pasar muy buenos momentos. Devoré sus páginas en unas pocas horas y me introduje en la historia fácilmente, disfrutando de cada una de sus páginas.

La relación que la novela crea con el mundo de booktube y de los blogs literarios es realmente buena. Obviamente, ambas vienen de ahí, ¡saben cómo va la cosa! Pero es tan bonito ver los inicios de un canal, el cómo el blog y el canal de YouTube son parte de la vida de la protagonista. Sin duda, una de las mejores cosas de la novela.

La Blogger Lit Con y las referencias a varios booktubers (¿saldré yo? uyuyuy, tendréis que leerlo para descubrirlo) me hicieron reír, ¡y vaya situaciones que se dan! Pese a que las tramas románticas no me convencieron del todo, las de amistad y familia sí que lo hicieron mucho más, aunque me hubiera gustado saber más sobre los personajes secundarios.

La protagonista, Emma, me pareció un personaje sencillo y básico. No estaba nada profundizado, pero tampoco es una novela que lo requiera, así que en ese sentido tampoco me molestó mucho. Eso sí, tiene muchas escenas con las que no llegué a conectar, pero todo lo que le pasa es más entretenido que ella en sí. (No sé si me entendéis.)

No quiero hacer ningún tipo de spoiler, obviamente, pero creo que es una novela para todo el mundo. La gente del mundo literario disfrutará la novela como un crío: está lleno de referencias a novelas y cosas frikis guays. La gente que no está tan metida en el mundo literario también lo disfrutará: las situaciones son para todo el mundo y se explica muy bien en qué consiste el mundo de booktube y demás.

En definitiva, una novela que recomiendo por su alegría, agilidad y por ser fresca. ¡Además se lee de una sentada! De verdad, disfruté mucho la novela pese a esos fallos que he comentado. Qué ganas de que todo el mundo la lea. ¡Qué orgulloso estoy de mis chicas!"
Besos entre líneas,Arely,"April 21, 2016",1.0,"*Respira profundo*
Antes de comenzar esta reseña, la verdad no quería hacerla porque qué pereza reseñar algo como esto, pero me puse a investigar un poco de las autoras (antes de este ""libro"" no tenía ni idea de quienes eran) y vi que una de ellas hacía una rese��a sobre otro libro que también había sido escrito por una booktuber y literalmente lo destrozó, entonces pensé que quizás sí valía la pena reseñarlo. Por eso de ""con la vara que midas te mediré"".
Así que comencemos:
Lo gracioso de todo esto, como dije antes, es que una de ellas destrozaba un libro escrito por una booktuber, y escribía todo lo horrible y las cosas malas que tenía el libro, cuando sus propio trabajo viene cayendo en todo lo que ella había detestado.
Para quienes hayan leído el libro podrán darse cuenta de esto.
Aquí un poco de sus criticas y me dicen si todo lo que ella odia es lo que escribió.



Ajá. Ya lo dices tú, ""cualquiera"".


¿Algo así como Besos entre líneas, no?




¡Es que hasta pareciera como si agarró todo lo malo y lo que odiaba de ese libro y vino y lo plasmó en el suyo propio! En fin... no pondré más sobre eso. Pueden leer su reseña en el blog de ella y darse cuenta por sí solos la ironía de todo esto.
Quiero decir, si yo critico algo, odio algo, detesto algo, por el sagrado amor de Jesús, lo último que haría es escribir la misma estúpida cosa.
Ahora bien, vamos por el libro en sí.
Debo ser honesta, lo leí, así en serio, leer , leer, hasta la mitad. Luego me di cuenta que no podría seguir desperdiciando mi tiempo. Tenía pendiente un libro que sí merece la pena. Así que la otra mitad me la fui saltando porque la verdad no me importaba un carajo nada de lo que pasaba. Sobre todo cuando meten a la pura fuerza al disque tercero en un triangulo amoroso más sin sentido y estúpido.
Puntualizaré las cosas que odié.
Porque sí, fui sacando cada cosa, si pudieran leer mis anotaciones verían lo frustrada y enojada que estaba conforme pasaba las paginas.
Tenemos a Emma que oh dios mío, súper sufrida. Tópico uno.
Es súper fuerte, valiente, increíble a pesar de todo lo que ha vivido. Tópico dos.
Conoce al chico malo del pueblo, mega machista (locura, porque una de las autoras es súper mega feminista, sí aja, se nota hija). Tópico tres.
El chico tiene un terrible pasado que lo hace actuar así. Tópico cuatro.
Puedo seguir y seeeeeguir enumerando cliché tras cliché, pero mi vida no es tan larga como para hacer tal cosa. Y si bien, a veces esos clichés no pueden ser tan chirriantes cuando se saben manejar bien. Pero aquí, Dios mío, no había profundidad, no había nada más que planicie.
Entonces Emma... les mostraré cómo es Emma. Nuestra mega sufrida pero valiente y nada egoísta chica.
- Comenzar con que la chica no capta el hecho que tiene que apagar su maldito celular.
- Tiene una obsesión increíble con los libros, que raya en lo ridículo. En realidad todos lo tienen. No pueden tener una conversación normal sin sacar algo de un libro. Alguna referencia, cualquier cosa. Todos son así. Hasta la disque suegra. O sea sí, entiendo que uno se enamora de algunos libros, pero tampoco te comportarás como una niña de doce años. Hasta el sonido de su celular, sí, ese que no para de sonar en la bibioteca porque la señorita no sabe como apagarlo, es referente a un libro.

Por cierto, por más que me quiera decir que su perra es casi como su familia no me la trago. Eso que le dice que la odia, que le grita y luego que la deja en la calle mientras esta en una librería, no le cre. QUÉ CLASE DE SER INSENSIBLE HACE ESO. La verdad no debería de sorprenderme, trata peor a su padre.

Ahora vamos con lo más polémico... tan tan: Las conversaciones de WhatsApp, o como Emma diría, Wasap.. Jé.
Por favor, quiero que alguien me ayude. Hasta me puse de cabeza tal vez lo descifraba y siento que si no sé qué dice, no podré dormir.

¿QUÉ LES PASA A ESTA GENTE? tiene artritis o qué. Qué alguien les tire un diccionario a la cabeza y de paso tal vez se mueren, ya mejor.
Ah, pero obvio nuestra perfecta Emma escribe de maravilla. Faltaba más, toda una bloggera y escribiendo como si lo hiciera con los pies.

Resumiré porque creo que ya se me está haciendo largo, pero es que esto tiene tanta tela qué cortar.
Emma y Eric se conocen en una biblioteca, él le mete hierva sin el consentimiento de ella, a su bolsillo. Al mismo tiempo que la besa, todo para distraer a un policía. Emma le cuenta a sus amigas artríticas lo que pasó y esto es lo que dicen:



¿QUÉ? para comenzar qué mierdas están diciendo. Y cómo es que las autoras escriben algo así. Cómo es que publican algo así. Yo en serio, bloqueo a alguien que me escriba así por retrasado.
Entonces Emma en algún punto del libro discute con su maestra porque esta infravalora los libros juveniles. Profesora :







¿Segura Emma que no tienes cinco? Porque tus rabietas me dicen lo contrario.
Todo, absolutamente todo es tan conveniente.
Antes dije que era increíblemente egoísta. Y lo es. Es una perra egoísta.
Para muestra un botón.

Porque el hecho que tu padre es paralitico no importa. Que quedó viudo tampoco. Que en cualquier momento puede morir, menos. Lo importante es su disque amor, sus libros y nada más. Esto deja mal parado a los Booktubers, a los Blogger y a los lectores en general.
¡PERO SI SOLO LO VES LOS FINES DE SEMANA Y NI SIQUIERA PASAS TIEMPO CON EL PORQUE TU VIDA ES SOLO LEER Y ERIC (EL DISQUE AMOR)! Válgame Dios, para tener hijos así, ya sí me replanteo apoyar el aborto.

Imagínense esta:

¿Cómo te atreves? ¿Cómo te atreves, estúpida selfish bitch a echarle la culpa a tu padre de cosas inexistentes? ¿De ocuparlo cómo peón para tus planes egoístas? ¿Pasar menos tiempo con él, para ver a un imbécil que es más plano que una carretera recién pavimentada? EN SERIO, ¿PODEMOS ABORTARLA YA? CREO QUE TODAVÍA ESTAMOS A TIEMPO.
Hay otra mejor:
a ver, sí o sí dan ganas de abortarla.


Y ni hablar de que el libro gira en torno a los booktube y ustedes saben, es la temática, pero en serio este libro debería de llamarse ""Lo que callamos los Booktubers"" o ""Diarios de Booktubers"" porque se supone que es un libro romántico. No le veo el romance. Es solo una lucha de una niña queriendo tragarse todos los libros y fantasea con salir con un su booktuber que oh sorpresa, se le hace realidad. Demasiado fanfic.

El interés amoroso no tiene nada que destacar. Su oh, tan horrible secreto ha sido usado quinimil veces que ni me sorprendió. Luego como dije antes, aparece el tercero. El mentado booktuber mexicano del que Emma se enamora, mientras se está enamorando de Eric. A la tipa no le basta uno. Y sí, puede que al principio solo sea una fantasía de ella, pero cómo este libro es súper realista, las cosas se dan por arte de magia y se conocen. Se besan. Ella lo besa. Le dice luego que no. Fin. A esta altura del ""libro"" me daban ganas de molerme la cabeza con un sartén.

Una pregunta, ¿cuál era el propósito de este libro? en serio, cuál. Por más que le busco no le encuentro nada. Ni si quiera entretenido es.

Me he desahogado, casi. Y la verdad lo que más me duele son las neuronas que perdí. Esas nadie me las regresa. Ni las horas.
Terminaré con una parte de la reseña con la que comencé, que siento se le ajusta a este libro increíblemente.



Usted juzgue."
Besos entre líneas,Mel,"August 8, 2016",1.0,"Voy a tratar también un tema pequeño, como Majo.
He caído; por morbo, como gran parte de las personas, pero he caído. Y me lo he tenido que tomar con mucho humor para conseguir terminarla y no morir en el intento. Todo lo que se dice de ella, y más, es cierto -las enfermedades, los clichés, el secreto secretísimo de Eric...- , pero a mí me gustaría hablar sobre un tema que no he visto mencionar, un tema -como el de Majo- minúsculo y apenas perceptible, y que a mí me toca personalmente.

He criticado -y casi desistido de ella- muchas veces, y con innumerables argumentos, al grado de Literatura/s Comparada/s. Muchas veces he criticado la falta de rigor, la incompetencia de determinados profesores y lo atrasados que vamos en el ámbito comparatista con respecto a países como EEUU, Inglaterra o Francia. Pero después de leer este libro tengo que salir en su defensa, y en defensa también de la literatura clásica, porque es a lo que me dedico, y me duele que intenten tomar a los lectores por tontos.

Me niego rotundamente a que los lectores, y sobre todo el público objetivo de este libro, conciba en su mente la idea de que los comparatistas, los que nos dedicamos a estas cosas (que son algo más que leer dos libros juveniles y compararlos), somos personas con estanterías llenas de colores y libros juveniles, distopías y ni un solo tomo de literatura clásica. No subestimo la literatura juvenil, reconozco su valía y me encanta que las personas lean cosas diversas (cosa que últimamente no veo mucho, todos leen lo mismo, y tampoco lo critico; ya se sabe, cada quién que lea lo que quiera). Del mismo modo, a las/los profesores de lengua, filosofía o matemáticas también les encantará que leáis, sea lo que sea. Si se alegran más cuando les dices que estás leyendo no es solo porque sea un clásico (y porque, para qué nos vamos a engañar, esa obra es genial), sino porque les estás hablando de literatura que conocen y que han disfrutado, igual que si a cualquier amante de Harry Potter le dices que has empezado a leer la saga a los 35 años. Es exactamente lo mismo. Pero volviendo a lo que me concierne, los estudiantes de Literatura Comparada no somos, ni por asomo, personas como Emma. Leemos mucho, tanto clásicos como literatura contemporánea; la diferencia, creo, está en que no es solo lectura por afición. Por supuesto que nos encanta leer (seríamos masoquistas si no nos gustara y siguiéramos allí), pero no desechamos una obra solo porque esté escrita en 1742 y no en 2014. Y quiero dejar algo muy claro: la literatura clásica NO ES un peñazo, NO ES complicadísima y enrevesada, NO ES inaccesible, y NO ES inútil. Y, por cierto, existe mucha más poesía más allá de Bukowski. Muchísima.

Me parece razonable que los lectores de juvenil defiendan su género favorito a capa y espada; lo entiendo, yo tampoco sé cómo la gente no puede no haber leído, qué se yo, a Dostoievski. Lo que no me gusta, en absoluto, es defender una cosa echando por tierra otra, sobre todo cuando se habla de dónde venimos, de nuestros antecesores, de todo lo que la historia universal nos ha legado. No. Y digo esto un día después del IV Centenario de dos de los más grandes escritores universales, que no son complejos, ni son inaccesibles, ni son ininteligibles. Y, mucho menos, aburridos. Son algunas de las más grandes obras de la literatura, y del mismo modo que a un lector juvenil le duele que digan que, no sé, Harry Potter es para niños (conste que no es mi opinión, es solo un ejemplo y es la saga más reconocida que se me viene a la cabeza), a mí me duele mucho que se diga que Shakespeare es un peñazo.

Lo siento, he aprendido a querer a mi carrera por encima de la burocracia y el sistema educativo pésimo español y me duele que se nos muestre como personas de cartón que no sabemos si quiera argumentar lo positivo o negativo de un libro cuando desde el primer día nos enseñan la cantidad de escuelas críticas y teóricas de la literatura que existen, los mil y un tipos de acercamiento a una obra y, por supuesto, intentan (y digo intentan porque yo eso lo traje a la universidad aprendido de mi profesor de bachillerato de Literatura Universal y a los profesores de mi facultad parece que no se les da bien) que se valore la literatura clásica, principalmente porque TODO, prácticamente TODO lo que se escribe ahora, no es nuevo, ya lo ha dicho alguien antes. Y, por supuesto, porque es igual de maravillosa que cualquier literatura actual: igual.

Después de todo esto, y ya acerca del libro en general y no de este aspecto, la no-trama, los no-personajes, las no-localizaciones, las incoherencias, esa cantidad ingente de referencias metidas con calzador... todo, todo era como mezclar todas las sobras de la nevera y hacerse un batido con ellas; nunca puede salir bien. Si lo he leído -además de por el morbo-, es porque Esme siempre me ha parecido cercana y noble.

Está claro, como ya han dicho, que el número de lecturas al año no incrementa tus dotes artísticas, ni mucho menos tu capacidad redactora y descriptiva. Por otro lado, espero que con esto y otros libros que se han estado publicando últimamente, los lectores nos hagamos conscientes del intento de tomadura de pelo de diversas editoriales y exijamos nuestro derecho a literatura de calidad (o, al menos, que tenga un mínimo de coherencia y una buena redacción).

Poco más por mi parte; leed mucha literatura, y no abandonéis los clásicos. No promocionar a un autor vivo por leer un clásico no significa que éste se vaya a morir de hambre por tu culpa.

ACTUALIZACIÓN. Lo que más me ha gustado de esta novela es la cantidad de amigos que estoy haciendo en dos días. Solo por eso, mi puntito sobre cinco.

ACTUALIZACIÓN 2: Hace un par de días recordé un punto de este libro que no comenté pero que me hizo reírme mucho. No sé a qué biblioteca universitaria iría la protagonista al final del libro, pero, al menos en las bibliotecas universitarias en las que yo he estado, no hay sección de ni sección de a secas; se cataloga por literaturas nacionales/regionales y dentro de eso, por géneros y orden alfabético. Pero la única literatura actual (si se le puede considerar así, porque la saga ya tiene unos cuantos años) es .
Y... bueno, los bibliotecarios con los que me he cruzado algunos días eran más agradables que otros, pero, seamos sinceros, me apiado del que se cruce conmigo en mis días menos agradables. La bibliotecaria de este libro no era una bruja; en los lugares públicos hay unas normas que se deben seguir. Las bibliotecas no son un centro comercial ni una librería; allí se va a leer, a estudiar, y a disfrutar del silencio que, por personas como Emma, a veces resulta complicado."
Besos entre líneas,papalbina,"April 26, 2016",1.0,"creo que muchos antes de mí ya han expresado lo que opinan sobre esta novela, así que me voy a limitar a dar mi opinión sobre un par de puntos.

1- esto es una de esas historias que escribíamos en el colegio en las que nuestras compañeras de clase aparecían como personajes y había mucho drama y tíos guapos (preferiblemente actores o cantantes, en este caso booktubers). es decir, esto es un fanfic.

2- a la zaga del punto 1, tiene la calidad literaria de un malo* en todos los sentidos, tanto en estilo (que en realidad no tiene), como en desarrollo de la trama (que no existe), construcción de personajes (que son personas que las autoras conocen, a las que les han cambiado el nombre y han tirao palante como si eso fuese suficiente para que el lector entienda a esos «personajes») y falta absoluta de documentación a todos los niveles (no solo en cuanto a enfermedades).

3- la inexistente trama no solo bebe de la literatura romántica actual del tipo (no, no de la juvenil, de la ), sino que además está llena de clichés de los que se usaban en las comedias románticas de los 90, que a mí me encantan, pero que si los veo por escrito en 2016 pues... y sobre el tema de las casualidades como «plot device», aka «eric hace chas y aparece a mi lado», ya se ha hablado suficiente y no necesito repetirme. simplemente: #facepalm.

4- normalmente no tengo problemas con protagonistas egoístas y egocéntricas, si en el transcurso del libro crecen y aprenden de sus errores. vamos, lo conocido como o , que está superpresente en la literatura (especialmente en la juvenil) desde el principio de los tiempos. el problema es que emma es egoísta al principio y es egoísta al final, no aprende nada durante el camino, y si cabe, termina la historia siendo peor y más engreída que como empezó. no se puede simpatizar con una protagonista así y mucho menos entenderla. y con respecto al nombre vamos a dejar algo muy clarito: emma no es un nombre tan común como maría, pero es más común en españa que, digamos, esmeralda (no lo digo yo, lo dice el instituto nacional de estadística), así que el momento «¿eres inglesa?» es pelín sangrante para todas las emmas españolas.

5- todas las referencias literarias y las opiniones gratuitas, que las autoras vierten en el texto con el pretexto de que es lo que piensa emma, están fuera de lugar y son demasiadas, pero lo que me ha parecido un lío es la mezcla de libros publicados en 2015 con libros o visitas de autores que realmente tuvieron lugar hace casi tres años (¿cómo ha leído la protagonista «el año pasado» si se publicó en 2015, si maggie stiefvater visitó españa en 2013? vamos a ver, ¿en qué año estamos que me pierdo?). un mínimo de coherencia en la línea del tiempo en el que vive la protagonista y en las referencias que se usan (sobre todo, si son referencias que tus lectores conocen) no es mucho pedir, ¿no?

6- me preocupa cómo está redactado este libro, de verdad que me preocupa mucho. no solo por las autoras, lectoras ellas, escritoras ellas, estudiantes ellas, sino por los editores. si un editor no es capaz de aconsejarlas y guiarlas (sobre todo teniendo en cuenta que es un libro por encargo), me pregunto muy seriamente qué hacen trabajando en este negocio. está claro que no saben producir un mínimo de calidad y yo como cliente me gustaría ponerles una reclamación (y no solo por este libro).

en resumen, el libro me ha parecido un proyecto horriblemente llevado a cabo, no solo por las autoras, sino principalmente por los editores, que se supone que son los que saben de estas cosas. entiendo que es muy tentadora la oferta de publicar un libro, pero si lo que produces es esto, igual deberías pararte a pensar antes, si quieres que la gente te conozca por este producto. es posible también que las autoras sufriesen en cierta medida de , es decir, que no fuesen capaces de reconocer los errores de su propio texto (a todos nos pasa en cierta medida con lo que producimos, sea una reseña, un vídeo, un tuit o un relato), pero ¿y toda la gente que lo leyó antes de salir? ¿es que no tienen un mínimo de decencia para ser honestos con las autoras y decirles: «así no»?

imagino que, como todo en esta vida, para may y esme esto será una experiencia, quizá más amarga de lo esperado, de la que aprenderán para el futuro. ¿quién sabe? igual más adelante nos deleitan con una buena novela juvenil.

* hay muchos ejemplos de bien escritos y maravillosos, para muestra un botón"
Besos entre líneas,Alejandra,"February 19, 2019",,"Después de golpearme la cabeza mil veces para poder leer este libro, aquí mis listas de impresiones:

***PRECAUCIÓN: Spoilers alert!***


Cosas que NO me gustaron de este libro:

1- Prácticamente desde la página inicial hasta la página final.
2- Me dijeron que esto era una novela en toda regla y no creo que llegue ni a fanfic aceptable.
3- La manera en la que la Emma se expresa y trata a su famila... Su perro, su Tia, su Tio, su hermana, todo en su familia le molesta.
4- Eric (en todos los sentidos, desde que besa a alguien a la fuerza y le esconde hierba en el bolsillo, hasta asesinar a su novia por conducir borracho, no lo soporto).
5- Los ""wasaps"" y la manera tan espantosa y poco entendible en que están escritos los mensajes de las amigas que se supone escriben blogs literarios (lo que debería ser una referencia, al menos, de ortografía)
6- El revoltijo de anorexia, depresión, alcoholismo, accidentes de transito, paraplejia, cancer y homosexualidad que no termina nunca de llegar a nada ni consigue enseñarte algo, sólo son temas importantes que las autoras pusieron ahí para tratarlos con la mínima seriedad.
7- 27 mil referencias literarias innecesarias que no llevaban a nada.
8- Los ""cameos"" de booktube. Demasiado para mí.
9- La falta de descripción general que tiene toda la historia
10- Los micromachismos de los que está llena la historia y que aún así te quieran vender que Emma es fuerte, luchadora e independiente.
11- Los constantes recordatorios de que Erick es guapo y de que Emma es perfecta (aún cuando todos sabemos que Emma no tiene ni un pelo de perfecta, si no que es una odiosa, egoista y manipuladora sin remedio)
12- El espantoso e innecesario triángulo amoroso
13- O sea güey, los mexicanos güey, también sentimos vergüenza, güey.
14- Todas las faltas de sentido y lógica de la historia. Por poner unos ejemplos:
A) La buena memoria de una niña de 6 años traumatizada por la repentina muerte de su madre y la desgracia de su padre.
B) Ir a una biblioteca buscando silencio y enojarte con la bibliotecaria porque te hace estar en silencio
C) Un desconocido te besa sin tu permiso, te dice que tiene hierba con él, estas desconcertada, pero pasa un policía para saber si estás bien y dices que sí ¿¿¿¿????
D) Vivir en un pequeño pueblo lleno de librerías y con una gran biblioteca (que me digan que pueblo para mudarme a él).
E) Renglón 2: ""Zoe te odio"". Renglón 5: ""No podría vivir sin Zoe""
F) Es una situación graciosa que un tipo te meta hierba en el bolsillo, si, super cómica! Mira que me muero de risa
G) Preguntarle a tu hermana anoréxica si ha adelgazado.
H) Tu madre fue asesinada por un conductor borracho, tu novio asesinó a su novia por manejar borracho, sabes lo que es ver destruido tu mundo por un ebrio inconsiente, pero pobrecito el novio, él no tuvo la culpa de nada...
I) Por cierto, no Emma, el error de Eric no fue saltarse un alto, el error de Eric fue subirse y manejar una moto acompañado cuando iba borracho. A ver si pones las cosas en claro...
J) En el epílogo, ella está hablando un segundo de su padre, su familia y sus vacaciones, de lo bien que le sentaron, pero al otro segundo, sin más, está en la Universidad de nuevo balbuceando sobre Erick. Y escenas así hay varias...
K) Podría seguir y darle 3 vueltas al abecedario, pero creo que ya se entiende a qué me refiero.
15- La mala narración, que es tan mala, que hasta yo que no sé narrar sé que es muy mala.
16- Emilio y Raquel son los nombres de los editores de este ""obra"", creo que ellos son lo que menos me gustó de todo, si hubieran sido buenos en su trabajo, no tendríamos que quejarnos de este libro...
17- Que May critique sin piedad libros machistas, sin trama ni sentido y llenos de clichés y que justo ella venga a vender, lo mismo que odia, en su libro. Hipocresía total.


Cosas que me gustaron del libro:

1- La dedicatoria de Esme para su abuelo.
2- Los agradecimientos de las autoras (creo que son la parte más entretenida del libro).
3- El no haber pagado para poder leerlo, porque si lo hubiera hecho, juro que viajo a España a estamparle el libro en la cabeza a alguien de la Editorial Planeta.

En RESUMEN: 17 aspectos negativos (sintetizados) contra 3 aspectos positivos.
Por favor, no gastes tu dinero en este libro, así tratamos de que más árboles no sufran el fatal destino de volverse este libro."
Besos entre líneas,Majo,"January 26, 2022",1.0,"Solo quiero tratar un tema. Uno pequeñito, sin importancia.

Los accidentes de tráfico.

En un solo segundo, una distracción, una mala maniobra, un error o simplemente una fatalidad del destino puede truncar una vida. Es un accidente, no pudo ser evitado, simplemente fue el momento y el lugar incorrecto. No se puede hacer nada, aunque duela.
Pero, Es sentir total desprecio por la vida humana, la tuya y, más importante, la de los inocentes transeúntes que no tienen nada que ver con la falta de moral del conductor. ¿No te agrada tu vida? Bien, es cosa tuya, hay miles de manera de ponerte en peligro sin poner en riesgo a los demás.
Un vehículo en manos de una persona alcoholizada no es diferente a un arma cargada en manos de un inconsciente.

Perder a alguien en un accidente de este tipo es tremendo, destroza todo a su paso y no hay consuelo ni preparación posible. Una vida perdida en solo un instante, sueños y caminos que ya no podrán ser transitados jamás. Familias rotas, amigos desconsolados, que no pueden comprender cómo alguien tan querido se ha ido sin decir adiós.


Perdón por el spoiler del próximo párrafo.

Emma es víctima de esto. Perdió a su madre en un accidente siendo una niña y su padre esta discapacitado por la misma razón. Por eso no me entra en la cabeza que su novio le confiese que mató a su anterior novia cuando él conducía borracho y ella le perdone. Y aún menos que ella lo consuele diciendo

No, no, no, no. Simplemente no.

O tal vez sí y Emma es una persona con un corazón enorme para perdonar a alguien por hacer algo así, cuando fue exactamente la misma razón por la que perdió a su madre. Yo no lo perdonaría jamás, ni en un millón de años. Pero es evidente que Emma es mucho mejor persona que yo.

Ahora, él asesinó (lo siento, no tengo otra palabra para decir esto) a su novia y… ¿sigue haciendo lo mismo? ¿Conduce ebrio cuando eso le costó la persona que más amaba? ¿Por favor que clase de ejemplo es éste? ¡Es el último modelo a seguir que yo le daría a la juventud!
Bien, tal vez la idea de las autoras era reflejar lo decadente de una sociedad que va directo al caño.


Por favor autoras, y lo digo con el mayor de los respetos, no tomen un tema como este tan a la ligera. Es doloroso, es cruel. ¿Tenéis la más mínima idea de lo que se siente perder a alguien de esta manera? ¡Espero que no! ¡Y rezo para que jamás les pase! Pero siempre pueden informarse, hablar con alguien, documentarse o simplemente leer los horrores que suceden en la sección de transito del periódico.
No tengo idea de cómo será esto en España, pero en mi país la tasa de muertes por accidentes de trafico es alta e incluso en los diarios hay un pequeño contador del horror que numera la cantidad de muertes por mes y contabiliza las anuales.
No es un tema bonito, así que por favor, tómenlo con respeto y no como una manera de añadir drama a un libro sin llegar a profundizarlo ni tratarlo apropiadamente.

No estoy enfadada con ustedes, solo estoy triste, muy triste. Porque sé que esta misma mirada sesgada sobre un hecho tan tremendo es compartida por muchos jóvenes. Por favor, quieranse más, protejan su vida y la del resto, no hay apuro por llegar a ningún lugar.


Solo era eso, ¿ven? Nada importante."
Besos entre líneas,Mike,"May 27, 2016",3.0,"2.5, más bien. Me gustaría haberle puesto más nota, pero no voy a inflarla solo porque las autoras sean mis amigas.

Lo que sentí gran parte del libro.
A ver definir lo que se siente en el libro en una imagen, es bastante complicado,pero la mas apropiada seria esta:

No sabréis si reíros de lo que escribe, enfadaros, poneros a llorar, sentir asco, tener miedo por como algún editor a creído que era buena idea publicar esto, o sentiros como el pobre Kyle comiendo mierda.

De la editorial que nos trajo el best seller a nivel mundial:

Rubius: ""Este ultimo año, Dominos Pizza la cual me paga cada vez que la menciono y cada vez que salgo haciendo el gilipollas en uno de sus restaurantes como en mi famoso vídeo pidiendo bordes de pizza (), y entonces cuando la editorial Planeta contacto conmigo y me propuso hacer un libro pensé, puedo sacar un libro para que mis fans hagan el gilipollas imitándome y yo seguir cobrando, así es como me inspire para hacer este libro.""
Rubius: ""Tienes fuego para el cigarro?, extra oficialmente te diré que pensé voy a trollear a toda mi audiencia sacando un libro mierda y a ver cuanto gente pica y mira best seller, espera esa grabadora no debe estar grabando?, la prensa inventa, NO fumo tabaco, a dicho eso un imitador mio no he sido yo, la prensa manipula lo que yo digo, dame la grabadora, mira que le pasa a la puta grasodsfjdsjdsjfsdi""()

------------------------------------

Voy avisando que esta reseña pretende que no compréis el libro, ni lo leáis, y dudo mucho que a menos de que viváis en una burbuja (), no leáis algo que dañe vuestra sensibilidad antes de llegar al final de esta, en caso de que aun así queráis leerlo os pediría por favor que no compréis el libro, pedirlo prestado, comprarlo de segunda mano u otros, no apoyéis a la editorial gracias. Intentare argumentar todo.

1. Poca sensibilidad al tratar temas delicados (por no decir nula, bizarra o de otra dimensión)

Antes de empezar me gustaría decir que May R. Ayamonte se a quejado en alguna ocasión que haya autores que se aprovechan de la homosexualidad y del cáncer (y por ende de otros temas delicados, que esto del paréntesis es algo que entiendo yo), sin informarse únicamente para vender mas libros.

-Empecemos pagina 1, esta es la que me toca a mi por haber vivido una situación similar, cuando tenia unos 18-19 años cuando cuidaba de mi prima de 6 años me llamo uno de mis tíos para informarme que había ido la policía a buscar la madre de mi prima (a su casa), y se la habían llevado al hospital y allí un medico la informaron de que su marido se encontraba muy grave, de hecho acabo muriendo, y bueno esto es lo que pasa cuando alguien esta inconsciente u otros en un hospital, la policía busca a un familiar, lo lleva al hospital sin decirle demasiado, y allí un medico te dice lo que te tenga que decir, vale hasta aquí mas o menos, pero me gustaría centrarme en que yo en ningún momento se me paso por la cabeza explicarle a mi prima la situación ni llevarla al hospital, a diferencia del libro...
Paso de explicar porque quien no entienda los motivos que se busque la vida.

-Por llevar unos gramos de hierba puedes ser detenido y es mejor arriesgarse a disimular besando a una chica desconocida.
Error, ningún policía te detendrá por llevar una poca cantidad de hierba, a menos que no trates de venderla y te pille, tampoco entiendo porque piensa que la policía lo va a chequear y decide disimular manoseando y tocando a la primera chica que encuentra, cosa que probablemente si te detengan, a menos que estés muy bueno y a la chica se le caliente todo el vagino, en este caso quizás la chica lo disfrute y no corras este peligro..., no se para que intento explicarlo, creo que todas las chicas que lean esto saben que si un chico desconocido se les tira encima, empieza a toquetearlas, ellas empezarían a gritar y si hay una policía cerca y pilla al chico este como mínimo pasa la noche en prisión.
(en serio no os a ofendido esto a las lectoras)

- La hermana que a tenido anorexia
Cual es la mejor pregunta a alguien en esta situación?
""—¿Cómo estás, hermanita? —me pregunta cuando por fin me suelta.
—Bien. ¿Y tú? ¿Has adelgazado? —le pregunto""
Siguiente, si alguien no lo entiende que pregunte en comentarios.

-El padre discapacitado 100% dependiente
El cual por falta de dinero a de estar en una residencia...
No quiero entrar mucho en materia, porque no conozco a nadie en esta situación, y es delicado, pero es al revés, hay gente sin dinero que no puede poner a un familiar en una residencia, a de cuidarlo 24 horas, y les imposibilita trabajar entre muchas otras cosas...
Hay muchos reportajes sobre el tema, como este: y multitud de asociaciones que hacen vagas constantemente, etc.

-Cáncer:
El cual básicamente servirá para dar pena sobre Eric, en ningún momento se nos mencionara si el cáncer es terminal, que tipo de cáncer, es mas la madre(que es quien lo sufre) a entrado en coma y los médicos no saben porque..., es un tema tan importante que al final no sabremos si la madre de Eric sobrevivió o murió...

-Traumas psicológicos:
Resumen una chica que su madre murió por un accidente con un borracho, y el chico
, las 2 ultimas personas que esperaría viendo como se emborrachan... y luego yendo a coger un vehículo, por suerte aparece un chico con mas criterio que estos dos, y la culpa sera de Eric, a pesar de que Emma iba con el sin protestar...

-Tirar fotos de la muerta el mismo día porque a nadie le pueden interesar
Soy insensible y si me pinchan no sangro...

-La lesbiana:
Tengo una pregunta la amiga lesbiana, la cual al ver a Gabriel suspira con todas las demás chicas ya que se nos especifica que la única excepción es Bea, podría considerarse personaje homosexual únicamente metido para vender aprovechándose de la comunidad LGTB?, porque lo único que hace es decir que es lesbiana y bailar con la novia, ya esta.
Sin contar que descubre que es lesbiana porque le gustan los personajes femeninos de los libros...

-Personas de habla no hispana:
Se aprovechas de esto para burlarse de ellas, aunque cuando les firman el libro parece que las entienden perfectamente...

-Mexicanos
I Si algún día habláis con un mexicano o con cualquier persona que no sea de vuestra región, por favor no intentéis comunicaros imitando la forma de hablar de su región, pensara que os estáis burlando de el.
II El dialecto mexicano se resume en incluir estas palabras: que onda, chido, neta y guey en todas las frases.
III ""—¡Ah! —se ríe—. Una de las cosas que he aprendido estos días en España es que pena aquí se dice vergüenza."", por supuesto los mexicanos desconocen la palabra vergüenza, porque deben ser unos poca vergüenzas ().

Ya puestos dinos que lleva un gorro y un bigote, total no sera mas ridículo, ni mas ofensivo, ni cliché.

2 MACHISMO

Van por allí diciendo que este libro no es machista, tanto May R. Ayamonte, como Esmeralda Verdú entre otros muchos booktubes, sin mencionar que May habla varias veces del patriarcado y el feminismo en su canal



Esto para nada es machista:

















Ni tampoco cuando piensan que Emma lleva droga que tiene droga, que ta tía monta un escándalo, pero cuando descubre que es de un chico, ya no importa, solo importa si esta bueno. Porque todos sabemos que si una chica fuma... (), pero si lo hace un chico es Sexy...

Espació dedicado a personas importantes que han hablado del libro

Darío Villanueva Prieto (Director de la RAE): Las autoras reinventan la gramática y la ortografía, después de haber leído este libro nos hemos dado cuenta que la lengua española necesita adabtarse a los nuevos tiempos, de momento hemos aceptado las palabras wasap y wasapear (), en breve adaptaremos las nueva gramática y ortografía planteadas en este libro.

--------------------------------





, la cual tiende a ser mala, , porque para nada son sospechosas estas cuentas que solo han leído un libro, no tienen amigos, votando-le 5 estrellas a este libro (besos entre líneas), sin avatar, crearon la cuenta el 15-16 de abril alrededor de las 12 de la noche y que han dado like a todos los booktubes/youtubers que son los únicos que han votado este libro positivamente no son para nada sospechosos de ser bots...
Pruebas:

El soporte técnico a solucionado el tema de los bots, asi que ya no existe un link a ellos.

Magia a subido la nota media de 2 a 3, aunque todos sabemos que los libros que rondan el 3 o menos son una mierda, pero bueno...

No se, soy masoquista, si lo encuentro de segunda mano lo leo y confirmo lo que dicen las reviews.

Recuerdo que hace muchos años, por allí al 2012 los youtubers decían que pararan los famosos de insultar a la música y dejaran a los músicos hacer música de verdad, quizás seria hora de empezar a decirles alguien que deberían dejar a los escritores hacer libros de verdad en lugar de estas cosas que creo que no llegan ni a fanfic o a un corta y pega en algunos casos.

PD: si alguien es de Barcelona y no lo quiere tener en la colección..., que de aquí nada es mi cumpleaños.

Mas reviews en dar a like si te a sido útil esta información, y si tenéis cualquier duda, queréis debatir algo, avisarme de algún error o cualquier otra cosa lo podéis hacer en los comentarios. ^^

PD: Cualquier cosa dicha por cualquier persona famosa en esta reseña puede haber sido re-interpretada, sacada de contexto o directamente inventada."
Besos entre líneas,Raquel Pérez,"April 27, 2016",1.0,"Solo tocaré tres puntos:
- Editorial: según se comenta por ahí fue Planeta quien encargó el libro a las autoras. Estupendo, ya no sólo publican cualquier cosa en Esencia (sello romántico de Planeta), si no que se permiten el ""lujo"" de gastar más dinero publicando libros como estos... se está cubriendo, y no precisamente de gloria...

- Autoras: ni las conozco ni las sigo, solo he investigado un poquito para saber algo de ellas. No entro en las ""guerras"" porque siempre hay tres versiones: la de unas, la de los otros y la verdad... que seguro no le importa a nadie, porque nos encanta poner a parir al vecino...

- Libro: quienes hayan sufrido (por degracia) alguna de las cosas que le pasan a la protagonista o situaciones que ocurren en el libro, seguro que no les va a hacer mucha gracia la manera en que son contadas. Yo me crié sin madre, cuidé desde los 16 años, y mientras estudiaba, a mi abuela, y después también mientras lo compaginaba con trabajo y cosas de casa. Después me tocó hacerlo con mi padre, aquí también compaginaba además mi aventura por internet.... y francamente, la manera de relatar la situación y el trato que la protagonista da a su padre me ha parecido vergonzoso a más no poder.
El resto como puede ser la anorexia se ha tratado de una manera muy superficial.
Sobre el triángulo amoroso no voy a comentar nada porque es un tema que es más viejo que unas bragas de esparto y está metido con calzador. Porque sí, porque se lleva y porque ""vende"".

En fin... tópico tras tópico tras tópico... Cuantas más cosas se puedan meter en trescientas y pico páginas mejor, así más gente se sentirá identificada... a fin de cuentas no es más que un libro ""encargado"" por una editorial que pretende ""vender"" un montón de ejemplares porque las autoras tienen un montón de seguidores en las redes sociales.
Pues buena suerte..."
Besos entre líneas,Patricia Ferrer,"December 29, 2016",3.0,felicidades a mis dos estrellas de amigas.
Besos entre líneas,Joan,"August 26, 2016",1.0,"No sé por dónde empezar, la verdad. Muchos habéis dado vuestra opinión, que era bastante negativa y lo curioso es que todo el mundo comentaba los mismos defectos. Aun así, no esperaba que el libro fuera TAN malo. De hecho, pensaba que estabais exagerando un poco. Bueno, allá voy.

Empecemos por el estilo. Es MUY pobre. Sí, tal vez la trama (si la hay) es muy simple y no ocurre absolutamente nada interesante o transcendente en todo el libro, pero eso no quiere decir que el estilo deba ser tan penoso. Las frases son demasiado cortas (un ejemplo inventado: Abro el armario. Hay una camiseta. La camiseta es verde. Me pongo la camiseta y salgo a la calle). A esto hay que añadir las faltas que hay por la novela y las frases tan ambiguas y confusas. Es que hay momentos en los que no queda claro de qué se habla, y como lector quiero que me lo cuentes bien, no tener que currármelo yo. Ejemplo: No entiendo cómo algunos elementos de la novela han pasado las revisiones (si han hecho alguna). Ejemplo: . PERSONAJES Y PERSONAJES. Queda fatal. O """". Yo ya...

Y bueno, luego está el tema de que se nota los cambios entre autora y autora. Es una lástima, la verdad. Si yo fuera Raquel y Emilio , en concreto desde el punto de vista de Emma y Eric. Esto le habría dado más riqueza a la novela dado que a) estaría justificado el cambio de estilo b) se podría explorar la ""historia"" desde dos puntos de vista.

También es interesante la falta de descripciones. Solo se nos dice que Eric es muy guapo y que tiene un cuerpo muy musculado. Lo mismo de Gabriel. Y también se nos dice que los tíos son muy guapos y que todo el mundo en este pueblo es muy guapo. Se podría decir que esta localidad es Ciudadanos convertido en pueblo. Hablando del pueblo, hay muchas contradicciones. Hay zona céntrica, un parque con un lago y todo (por lo que se deduce que es grande) y un supermercado con un párking (cosa que tienen los pueblos grandes). No obstante, Emma se encuentra con todo el mundo allá donde va, y nos dice más tarde que su pueblo se puede cruzar en 20 minutos. (????). Eric, por ejemplo, está por todos sitios: es un DJ, trabaja en la residencia, sale del hospital cuando Emma y Lys van a la ecografía, está en el hospital cuando ingresan al padre de Emma, Emma se encuentra a una mujer con el coche averiado y resulta ser la madre de Eric, etc.

Y diréis, ""Bueno, no hay descripciones, pero al menos hay diálogos."" Los diálogos son lo peor. Creo que muchas veces se piensa que hacer los diálogos es muy fácil, pero yo opino lo contrario. Hacer una buena conversación es muy complicado, y más si quieres que a través de estas el lector conozca más a los personajes (cosa que aquí no se consigue). Usaré como ejemplo la famosa discusión sobre la literatura juvenil: ""-... esto sí que es una novela de verdad y lo que los jóvenes deberían leer. No como los libros juveniles que ahora están poblando las librerías, llenos de historias sin sentido, hechos solo para entretener y sin ningún tipo de valores. (...) -Siento discrepar de lo que está diciendo. La literatura juvenil está infravalorada y lo veo injusto, pues es tan rica y valiosa como cualquier otra."" ¿No os chirría un poco? Otro ""-Estoy con , una novela de Laura Gallego. He oído muy buenas opiniones sobre ella. Aunque, ya sabes, es Laura Gallego, no hay más que añadir-contesto sonriendo. -Uf, de esa leí , qué peñazo. (...)"". Y ojo, que los hay peores. En resumen,

Hablemos ahora de los personajes. La protagonista de esta ¿historia? es Emma, una chica que lee un montón de libros y es friki por ello. En serio, lee muchos libros. Hay tantas referencias (aunque me esperaba más), que cansa. A ver, a mí me gusta que los autores metan referencias en sus libros, pero deben tener algún significado. El lector las pillará o no, pero es que esto es exagerado. Además, se meten libros que no conoce ni Dios. Está bien que menciones a Matilda, Harry Potter o Jane Austen, pero es que al lado de estas obras nadie conoce ""La estadística del amor a primera vista"" o ""Prohibido"". A los títulos los acompañan las opiniones de la protagonista, que están metidas ahí porque sí y queda fatal: ""Voy a intentar empezar (...). Dicen que va sobre el acoso escolar y que está cargado de valores"". O: "" (...) un novela preciosa, con una protagonista muy inteligente."" Es que no. No. Parecen mini-reseñas hechas para que el lector compre el libro. Como son muchas referencias, para no cortarla a mitad.

Sigamos hablando de Emma.. Todo es drama por crear drama (volveré más tarde a este punto) y, al contrario que con Bovary, no está justificado. Mientras que con Bovary puedes conectar y entender su situación, con Emma la de BEL es imposible. Es egoísta y manipuladora, y es más plana que un folio. . Se ha intentado meter en ella todos los tópicos de la ""cultura adolescente"", y no ha funcionado. Además, tiene una visión del mundo (mundo mundial, que dice ella) tan inmadura como ella, que le hace parecer una niña de 12 años que cree que en su vida todo es una puta mierda y que nadie le comprende. Ah, Emma hace un comentario a su hermana, que sufrió anorexia, más que inapropiado. También tiene una amiga lesbiana cuya función es demostrar lo progre que es ella. Volveré a esto más tarde. También ve a su padre como una carga y hay un momento en la obra que dice que quiere tener tiempo para preocuparse de su blog, su canal y de Eric. ¿Hola? Eso no es nada comparado con tu padre que te necesita para hacer TODO. Que no se me olvide: se ve que la relación machista de Emma con Eric es lo único que importa, porque en la novela hay un momento en el que Eric se va y vuelve cinco meses después. No se nos cuenta nada sobre Emma, su familia, sus amigas, etc. hasta que Eric vuelve cinco meses después. ¿Qué se consigue así? Pues parece que la vida de Emma gira entorno de su “novio”, y se da a entender a los más jóvenes que cuando uno/a tiene pareja su vida debe girar entorno a esta persona. . Otra cosa que me ha molestado, tal vez por haber sito estudiante de 2 de Bachiller hasta este mayo, es que Emma se pele las clases, no estudie una puta mierda ni durante el curso ni para selectividad y consiga entrar con nota. Es que no me lo creo. Llega a decir que ""les han preparado muy bien"", cuando no ha hecho nadaaa.

Luego está Eric. También otro estereotipo. Eric es el chico que llega al pueblo (como Léon, pero esto Emma no lo pillará porque ella solo lee a Austen (otro tópico usado para justificar que los adolescentes también leen clásicos)) y que tiene un pasado oscuro.

Este pasado oscuro justifica que trate a todo el mundo fatal. Es un machista de mierda fan de Bukowski (otro misógino de mierda, qué sorpresa), pero esto está justificado por su pasado oscuro y por todo lo que ha sufrido. El personaje aparece por primera vez cuando besa a Emma SIN SU PERMISO. Luego procede a meterle maría en el bolsillo (muy normal, oye). Pero lo peor es que Emma no hace NADA. Y al no hacer nada parece que esto es normal. Y por tanto, SE ESTÁN NORMALIZANDO RELACIONES TÓXICAS Y MACHISTAS. Que le llega a llamar ""rara"", ""friki"" y ""aburrida"" delante de sus padres (lo mejor es la madre justificando lo que hace su hijo). Es verdad que al final de la novela Emma admite que esta relación es destructiva, pero al decidir volver con él se da a entender que este tipo de relación es buena. Sigamos con Eric.

Eric . Se nos dice que le gusta el cine francés (porque a todo chico malo le tiene que gustar la poesía y el cine francés) pero luego llega la mayor contradicción ever (que nadie ha comentado aquí). Cuando Emma y Eric quedan a ver , él le dice que no le ha gustado porque ""le falta acción"". LE FALTA ACCIÓN. ¿Desde cuándo las películas francesas son conocidas por tener persecuciones policiales y tiroteos entre mafias? Este es un claro ejemplo de cómo las personalidades cambian como convienen. Y este chico tan malote y oscuro dice . Muy coherente, vamos. . A ver, la justicia le obliga a hacer trabajos comunitarios por homicidio imprudente (supongo, porque eso no se menciona). Eric está en segundo de Bachillerato, por lo que tiene unos 17-18 años (se nos dice que es de la edad de la protagonista). Más adelante nos cuentan que el accidente donde murió su novia fue hace 3 años. Por tanto, tenía 15-16 años. ¿Y QUERÉIS QUE ME CREA QUE CUANDO UN MENOR MATA A OTRA PERSONA EN UN ACCIDENTE NO CAE NINGUNA RESPONSABILIDAD LEGAL SOBRE LOS PADRES?

También están los personajes secundarios, que están ahí porque Emma no puede estar sola en la historia. Los tíos sirven para representar a esos padres que no dejan hacer nada a sus hijos adolescentes. Aunque la tía tiene algo más de protagonismo, David (el tío) solo sirve para darle una cámara a Emma y para apoyarla en todo lo que hace. Sabemos tan poco de estos personajes que nos enteramos de que no están casados en el epílogo (???). Que sí, que no es un dato imprescindible pero es que la tía se dedica a organizar bodas. Y luego está el padre que solo sirve para meter el tema de las enfermedades o problemas tipo el ser paralítico. No sé exactamente que tiene, porque no se llega a especificar.

Luego tenemos a la hermana que sufrió anorexia. Emma lo pasó muy mal, pero no sabe cómo tratar este tema. Al igual que las autoras. Lo siento, pero parece que este personaje solo está ahí para poder meter el tema. Y lo mismo pasa con la amiga lesbiana. Esta sirve para meter el tema de la homosexualidad, pero también para demostrar lo abiertas de mente que son las autoras. Quedaría bien, pero Emma la caga cuando dice que sospechaba de la orientación de su amiga porque siempre le habían gustado más los personajes femeninos (?????). A mí me suelen gustar más los personajes femeninos y eso no me hace heterosexual.

Sandra, la amiga lesbiana, es la que más protagonismo tiene por su orientación sexual, porque de las demás amigas sabemos solo su nombre y que viven en otro pueblo. Tienen tan poca importancia como los compañeros de clase o el chico universitario, que a saber por qué está ahí.

Y no nos olvidemos de Gabriel, un personaje secundario que solo está ahí para hacer un triángulo amoroso (bastante malo, por cierto). No aporta NADA a la obra y de su personalidad solo sabemos que es muy tierno con Emma pero un chulo cuando liga con otras. Su momento estelar es cuando intenta mantener relaciones sexuales con Emma. Aquí introducen las autoras : no es no. No obstante, este mensaje En fin, que es otro machista más. Ah, solo sabe usar palabras como “neta”, “chavo/a”, “onda”, “güey”, ""platicaste"", ""ándale"" y cosas por el estilo. Y no olvidemos la confusión con “pena” y “vergüenza”. Creo que llega a decir . CUANDITO. Si este estereotipo andante ya hace que te entren ganas de llorar puesto que roza el racismo, no olvidemos que se nos dice que los latinos son de .

A Gabriel le gusta hablar también de que en México no tienen tantos libros traducidos como en España (hablan de ello como dos veces en dos pasajes distintos, así porque sí). Y Emma le contesta que allí también hay muchos libros que en España no tenemos. Já. No soy un experto, pero solo hay que ver las estadísticas: en España se lee alrededor de 24 veces MÁS que en todos los países de habla hispana de Sudamérica, América central y del norte (sí, Emma, México forma parte de América del norte, no del sur). Tal vez no tengamos libros como , pero aquí todo llega y si algo se publica primero en América en seguida llega aquí, cosa que no ocurre siempre en el sentido contrario.

A este booktuber hay que añadir al resto, basados en personas reales. Los nombres son muy parecidos, aunque están un poco disimulados. Eso lo entiendo, pues supongo que es un guiño a sus amigos. Aun así, no he podido con el . Hablando de personas reales, mencionemos a los autores.

En el libro aparecen algunos autores como Cassandra Clare, pero hay otros como David Levithan, Maggie Stiefvater y Jennifer L. Armentrout (algo así) que HABLAN. A ver, a mí me parece bien que se mencionen autores y tal, o incluso que se diga que están en el mismo sitio que el/la protagonista, pero es que en este libro están poniendo palabras en la boca de personas que existen, opiniones (MUY personales) que tal vez estas personas no compartan. Sí, la autora de sí que ha venido a España y tal vez lo que dice sea una reproducción literal de un comentario que hizo en una charla, pero dudo que las palabras de Levithan y de Armentrout sean reales.

Anyways, pasemos a los que se tratan en la novela. Son demasiados. Encontramos:
– Anorexia
– Discapacidades
– “Asuntos” LGTBI+
– Cáncer
– Accidentes de tráfico
– Autolesiones
– Traumas psicológicos
– Drogas
. Estamos ante un libro de unas 300 págs., por lo que los temas no se pueden tratar con mucha profundidad. Se podrían haber tratado mejor si las autoras se hubiesen informado un poco más, que no cuesta mucho. Y otras cosas son súper básicas: cuando una persona está hablando y otra persona dice lo mismo pero en otro idioma, esta persona está haciendo de intérprete y no de traductor. ¿Y desde cuándo hay sección de literatura juvenil en las bibliotecas universitarias?


La anorexia de Lys, por ejemplo, está muy mal llevada. Emma es una capulla; le dice “¿Has adelgazado?”. ¿Cómo le dices eso? Además, el trastorno alimenticio de la hermana solo sirve para que nos dé pena Emma (bueno, se intenta), ya que nos hablan de lo mal que lo pasó ella. Pero no se explican los sentimientos de Lys (la hermana), ni nos dicen cómo lo llevó ella y cómo consiguió salir.

Camila, la madre de Eric, sufre cáncer de mama (vaya, qué sorpresa). Y pasa lo mismo que con la anorexia: Esme y May se han informado mal y la enfermedad solo sirve para que Eric nos dé pena. Camila no habla en ningún momento de su enfermedad, eso ya lo hacen los demás por ella. La gota que colmó el vaso es cuando entró en coma. A ver, según tengo entendido una persona con cáncer no entra en coma así porque sí. No tengo ni idea así que si alguien lo sabe decídmelo, por favor. Otra cosa en común que tienen Camila y Lys con el padre de Emma es que este también sirve para dar pena. Y el problema es que no sabemos qué le pasa, y creo que ni las autoras lo saben.

Una cosa que me ha tocado mucho la moral han sido los accidentes de tráfico. En la novela se dan dos, el de los padres de Emma y el de Eric y su novia. Y Emma empieza a odiar a Eric por lo que hizo, pues alguien como él mató a sus padres. Pero luego la tía va y se lo perdona, y empieza a decirle que no es su culpa y blablablá.

En cuanto a las autolesiones, decir que se hace coña de ello. Literalmente. Es que no sé ni cómo criticar esto, me parece patético. Los traumas psicológicos, en cambio, si que se toman más , pero fallando estrepitosamente.

Y el manual de booktube ha sido genial. Los pasos, los tipos de vídeo. *rolls eyes*

Quiero terminar hablando de la polémica que se creó con los bots en Goodreads y dedicándole unas palabritas a la editorial Planeta. Yo fui de los que me di cuenta de que había bots, y de hecho descubrí que algunos ""usuarios"" tenían fotos de personas sacadas de internet y con otros nombres (lo que sería suplantación de identidad). Me puse en contacto con Goodreads en seguida. Y no, no es porque me caigan mal las autoras, es porque no me da la puta gana que se gaste así esta red social. Cuando entro aquí quiero ver puntuaciones y reseñas honestas, y no pienso tolerar que me quiten eso.

Decirle a Planeta que no tienen vergüenza. Han usado a las autoras y el producto que han hecho para lucrarse. No han usado ni un mísero corrector (o eso parece) y, siendo honestos, creo que tenían prisa en publicar la novela un poco antes de las Ferias del libro, para poder así hacer una buena campaña y beneficiarse económicamente a costa de una historia de la que, seguramente, las autoras están orgullosas. Estas dos chicas han visto como una editorial se ha aprovechado de ellas sin darles nada a cambio. Y si no es así, si realmente los trabajadores de la editorial han trabajado con la novela, decir que lo hacen de pena.

Seguramente me olvide de muchas cosas importantes, pero este libro me ha hecho enfadar tanto que ya no sé de qué más hablar.

Besos entre líneas,Renata,"May 24, 2016",1.0,"Bueno, seguramente ya habréis leído muchas cosas y siento decir que opino lo mismo que casi la mayoría. Todo lo que diré tendrá spoilers así que si no habéis leído el libro no leáis de aquí abajo y si no estáis de acuerdo con lo que diré lo entenderé. Creo que será la reseña más larga que escribí pero bueno, necesito sacar la rabia que llevo dentro.

Antes que nada quiero decir que estoy decepcionada, sigo a May y Esme en Youtube desde hace un año creo y esperaba un poco más de ellas teniendo en cuenta que se quejan tanto de las protagonistas infantiles, del instalove, del machismo, de que son feministas...todo eso te hace pensar que lo pueden reflejar de una manera buena en una novela que han escrito no? Pues no, hicieron de todo menos enseñar algo bueno.

Emma me pareció el personaje más egoísta que he encontrado hasta ahora en los libros que leí, de verdad. No puedes quejarte de la vida tanto ni de ser tan ignorante y ugh, de verdad, tenía muchas ganas de que alguien le diera una luz y reaccione pero no y me exasperó muchísimo. Emma tiene que cuidar de su padre inválido UNA vez a la semana ya que el resto de los días vive en una residencia y SE QUEJA, obviamente UN DÍA A LA SEMANA cuidando a tu padre es lo peor que te puede pasar ya que no tienes tiempo de estar con un chico que te trata mal ni escribir reseñas para tu blog, obvio. Luego otra cosa, cuando estás con tu familia no puedes quejarte de que te hagan hacer cosas normales. Que laves los platos, poner la lavadora, ayudar con la comida, ordenar tu habitación, limpiar el polvo, etc. es lo peor que le puede pasar a una adolescente verdad? Pobre Emma, menos mal que ella es la única que tiene que pasar por cosas tan duras en la vida.

Me pareció demasiado egoísta que le dijera a su padre que no iba a quejarse de ser inválido ya que ella le trae el desayuno cada vez que está en su casa, que es y repito, un día a la semana. Cuando va a la residencia de su padre más que nada va para ver al chico de que se enamoró e ignora completamente a su padre, cuando está en casa está más pendiente de libros, novios y de sus vídeos en Youtube que de su padre. Prefiere estar encerrada en su habitación e ignorar a su padre cuando el pobre hombre solo está tranquilo cuando su hija, la cual pasa de el completamente, está cerca. Es que no aguanto eso, yo soy de poner la familia por delante de cualquier otra cosa y leer esto me dio muchísimas ganas de coger a las autoras y darles un librazo en la cabeza.

Claro Emma, cuidar del único familiar de grado uno que te queda es una carga ya que te quita tiempo de hacer vídeos en Youtube, de ir tras un chico, de hacerte la guay por la vida y quejarte de todo lo demás. ¿De verdad las autoras quieren que pensemos que la protagonista pasó por tantas dramas y tiene diecisiete años?

Cuando una persona va a la biblioteca, lo primero que hace es poner el móvil en silencio. De verdad, todas las partes en la biblioteca me hicieron pensar si de verdad las autoras entraron por lo menos una vez en sus vidas en una biblioteca. No sé en otras ciudades, pero en la mía cada vez que voy los que trabajan allí son de lo más simpáticos que hay y hablo ya de 4 bibliotecas distintas, hasta me hice amiga de una bibliotecaria y nos recomendamos libros. No puedes dar ese ejemplo de la típica biblioteca donde los que trabajan allí odian que seas joven y te tratan mal. Puede que haya algunos pero de verdad, todos los que conocí yo son increíbles así que me llevé una decepción bastante grande cuando leí como lo pasaba en la biblioteca y todo eso. También la discusión en la clase sobre la literatura juvenil fue lo más tonto de la vida. Una profesora de literatura nunca, nunca pero nunca te dirá que dejes de leer.

El chico, Eric, es guapo, muy guapo y tan guapo y especialmente guapo pero ante nada guapo. Vamos a ver, las autoras no paraban de mencionar en cada página lo guapo que era y cansa muchísimo. Vale que lo digas una vez, dos o tres pero que lo digas cada vez que hables sobre el chico ya enerva. Su historia me pareció irrelevante, drama gratis always, verdad? Lo peor de todo es que juegan con enfermedades importantes y lo hacen parecen tan normal que me estresa. La madre de Eric tiene cáncer y no sé, pero yo tuve familiares con cáncer y lo pasas mal, pero Eric hoy está mal y mañana genial. Que me diga la receta ya que yo una me consumo hasta no poder más con cosas así. No sé, ningún personaje me pareció complejo ni que tenga una historia creíble ni que puedas decir ""me gusta este"".

Me pareció muy fuerte que en las primeras partes donde se encuentran, Eric le cuela una bolsa de drogas a Emma y la tía, Anne, se enfada pero cuando sabe que el chico que le coló las drogas es guapo, le perdona. ¿HOLA? Vamos todos a encontrar a una persona guapa y ponerla como excusa ante todo! Luego que una de las autoras diga que es feminista 100% y en el libro ves que perdona al chico por tratarla mal y lo típico le perdona por que es guapo me pareció absurdo. Es que encima hay la frase de ""si te hace daño significa que le importas"". GENIAL EH, DE VERDAD¿¿¿CÓMO PUEDES PONER ESTO CUANDO DICES QUE ERES FEMINISTA Y ESTÁS CANSADA DE CHICOS ASÍ EN LA LITERATURA???

Gabriel es un Booktuber que tiene 500.000 suscriptores y Emma empieza a hacer sus vídeos gracias a el. Todo bien, pero no tenemos que olvidar el hecho de que Gabriel también es muy guapo. Dudo que hacía falta todas esas expresiones de , y y todo lo demás. La parte donde dice pero vamos a ver, qué estupidez es esa? Los españoles son de sangre fría? Los del oriente de sangre azul y los del occidente de sangre roja?

Las partes donde Emma habla sobre los vídeos en un cierto momento estuvo interesante ver como te lo decían por su propia experiencia pero habían demasiados detalles irrelevantes que no aportan nada a la historia. Luego me pareció demasiado irreal que ganara 124 subscriptores en pocas horas y no sé cuantos miles en el blog. Los subscriptores no caen del cielo tan rápido y todo es tan no sé, irreal que te hace decir basta basta y basta.

El triángulo amoroso ya fue el chiste de la vida. Me pareció muy forzado y no le veías la trama ni nada y acababas el capítulo con una cara de ""en serio?"". Deja a X y se va con Y pero luego deja a Y para irse con X y vuelve con Y para acabar con X, no entiendes nada. De verdad Emma parece que tenga 12-13 años y no 17-18.

La hermana de Emma, Lys, se supone que pasó por anorexia y consiguió curarse gracias a Emma, cuando tenía 9 años, ya que le pidió llorando que la quiere en casa. Claro, ahora yo le diré a mi hermana de 9 años que vaya en los hospitales y pida llorando a todo el mundo que se cure y magia, todos sanos. Tampoco puedes saludar a una persona que pasó por anorexia con un ""¿Has adelgazado?"" Que sigue? Me pareció absurdo. Además su único papel en la historia es recordar el tema de la anorexia cada vez que aparece.

Los personajes secundarios fueron un fracaso. Intentaron mezclar muchas temas importantes para quedar bien y ha salido un completo desastre. Se supone que una de las amigas de Emma es lesbiana y le dio miedo decir que tiene novia. Eso se entiende, pero luego ya no menciona nada más y queda como un simple ""comí patatas por la mañana"" genial, pero no aporta nada. Es lo típico de ""tengo un amigo gay así que no soy homófobo"". Y las amigas necesitan unas clases de ortografía o algo así? Si habéis leído el libro no os pareció raro que las dos amigas escribían TAN HORRIBLEMENTE MAL pero Emma no? Yo una lo vi tan mal hecho que casi me pongo a llorar. Vale que sean conversaciones en WhatsApp (que por cierto, es wasap según el libro) pero yo una no escribo así ni todos mis amigos hacen esas faltas. Y ASÍ EN CADA MOMENTO, PERO VAMOS A VER CÓMO PRETENDES QUE ME TOME EN SERIO ESTO? Puede que hayan personas que escriben así pero por favor, es un libro, un LIBRO, no una copia de seguridad de WhatsApp.

He llegado a contar hasta 84 referencias de libros y autores y en un momento dado me cansé de contarlas. Está bien poner una referencia o unas cuantas, te hace pensar que te acercas un poco a la protagonista pero de verdad tantas malditas referencias te cansa y muchísimo. También quisieron decir que leían novelas clásicas, adivinad la autora? Claro, Jane Austin. Podían haber puesto que muchos leímos el libro en bachillerato, es un autor que todos conocemos, Agatha Christie, Cervantes, Tolstoi, etc, podían haber puesto más variedad y no acabar solo con Jane Austin y pocas veces con Bukowski.

Leí muchas frases sin cohesión y no entendía lo que querían decir, por ejemplo tu lees la frase, cierras los ojos, los abres, vuelves a leer y te quedas igual, solo con un dolor de cabeza gratuito y así en todo el libro. No sé si el libro tuvo un corrector pero parece que acabaron el libro y lo publicaron. De verdad creo que si alguien hubiese hecho unas cuantas lecturas pudieron haber cambiado el libro y hubiese acabado muchísimo mejor.

Otra cosa que quería comentar es que me parece hipócrita que las autoras digan en sus vídeos ""este libro me pareció una mierda"" y van al siguiente pero para el suyo se volvieron muy sensibles. Las críticas son para ayudarte a mejorar y no crear cuentas falsas para subir la puntuación. También me pareció feo que los amigos, que también son Booktubers/Bloggers le dieran notas tan altas sin argumentación alguna. Llamadme rara pero un libro así tiene que tener una argumentación muy profunda para que te guste por que yo le di todas las ganas posibles para acabarlo.

Casi se me olvida, en todo el libro Emma recibe insultos y burlas de sus compañeros y familiares por leer tanto pero cuando se vuelve famosa por sus vídeos la tratan bien. Me parece que estamos en un momento donde hemos dejado eso de lado, no os parece? Creo que intentaron defender tanto que un joven pueda pasarse los días en una habitación leyendo que se olvidaron de hacerlo realista y no tan cliché. Emma no para de decir que es una friki y tiene cosas de frikis y hace cosas de frikis y una cosa, que te guste leer no te hace para nada friki. Si es así entonces somos todos unos frikis sin vida social que nos escondemos en los libros? Se les fue de la mano. Me pareció un poco prepotente de sus partes decir ""ya soy famosa ya me tratan bien"" y tu ves que en todo el libro nadie entiende su pasión por la lectura, y es una pena.

May y Esme, la próxima vez que escribiréis un libro, por favor, intentad hacer que la protagonista no parezca que tenga 12 años y sea infantil, egoísta, hipócrita e insensible. Ningún ser puede tratar así a su propio padre y por eso mi puntuación, una persona con poco corazón puede ser tan egoísta y manipuladora y pensar esas cosas sobre su padre. La trama está más o menos bien, entiendo que no tengan experiencia y todo, pero los personajes si quieren gustar los tienes que hacer un poco más creíbles y que no sean tan odiables.

Y otra cosa, May en una de sus reseñas hablando sobre el libro de , lo dejó por los suelos diciendo que era una mierda (literal). Voy a citar sus palabras por que vamos, es la risa.



Pues resulta que sí, otro intento fallido de convertir a una youtuber en escritora para explotarla y sacar dinero de su fama y me parece peor aún, estamos hablando de unas personas que hacen vídeos sobre libros.

Me da lástima que el libro sea tan malo ya que especialmente May se queja en sus vídeos de protagonistas que no se salvan solas, clichés, chico malo, protagonista infantil, etc. pero en vez de usar todas las críticas que hacen lo usan para crear algo que ellas mismas dicen que odia. Es demasiado contradictorio. Una pena que en vez de usar la fama para crear algo profundo y que se te quede, por pereza de dar críticas y corregir faltas esenciales, resulta ser un fanfic en vez de libro."
Besos entre líneas,Isa Cantos (Crónicas de una Merodeadora),"May 24, 2016",3.0,"He aquí mi reseña del libro que todo el mundo ha crucificado y que ha causado una polémica tremenda en el mundo blogger y booktuber. Sí, me gustó; y sí, le doy 3,5 estrellas y ya van a ver por qué.

Besos Entre Líneas nos cuenta la historia de Emma, una chica que está cursando su último año de instituto, que no tiene muy claro qué hacer con su vida y cuya familia es un poco complicada, pues su madre está muerta y su padre está física y mentalmente discapacitado. Quizá una de las pocas cosas que Emma tiene clarísimas es que le encanta a leer y que uno de los momentos más felices de su día es cuando se sienta frente al ordenador a escribir las reseñas de los libros que lee. Eventualmente, aparecerá por su pueblo Eric, un chico guapísimo y, a todas luces, problemático del que Emma no puede evitar sentirse atraída. Así, el libro se desarrollará en medio de pequeños dramas familiares, encontronazos con Eric, el momento en que Emma descubre BookTube y se crea su canal, eventos literarios y amistades que podrían terminar siendo un poco más que eso.

Hablemos un poco de :

La trama de Besos Entre Líneas es relativamente sencilla, es una sucesión de hechos dentro de la vida de una adolescente que adora leer. Idas al Instituto, viajes a eventos literarios y escapadas a la biblioteca. Ahora bien, aunque la trama sea sencilla, muchos de las escenas del libro las sentí como propias, como si yo hubiera estado allí mismo... y podría decirse que es verdad. Me explico: para los que no lo saben, estuve estudiando en Madrid (España) durante buena parte del 2013 y el 2014... y Besos Entre Líneas está ubicado temporalmente en esa franja de tiempo. Hubo dos momentos del libro que me marcaron:

1. En un capítulo, Emma va a una firma de libros de Maggie Stiefvater en el Fnac de Callao, en Madrid. YO estuve en esa firma de libros, escuché las palabras de Maggie, hice la fila, me tomé foto con ella y conocí a muchos . El leer esa misma escena en el libro me impactó muchísimo, pues (obviamente no iba a pasar) sentía que de un momento a otro yo iba a aparecer en las páginas... o, bueno, no aparecer, pero de cierto modo sabía que yo ""estaba"" allí.
2. Más adelante, a finales de Mayo o inicios de Junio, Emma se dirige a uno de los eventos literarios más importantes de Madrid: la Blogger Lit Con. Allí conoce a Gabriel y muchos otros y con nombres en clave de sus versiones reales. ¡Oh, sorpresa! YO ESTUVE en esa Blogger Lit Con, así que cuando leía esos capítulos del libro me sentía como si yo misma estuviera corriendo a las casetas, paseando por el Retiro, yendo a firmas de libros y comiendo con todos los asistentes. De nuevo, sentía que de una manera indirecta yo estaba dentro del libro.

Y sí, sí, sé que estas dos pequeñas anécdotas o coincidencias circunstanciales no le agregan valor literario o calidad, o como quieran llamarlo, al libro, pero sí que hacen que sea muy especial para mí. Sinceramente, después del capítulo de Maggie Stiefvater le cogí muchísimo cariño a la historia. Adicional a todo esto, si bien sentía en algunos momentos que ciertas líneas parecían un ""manual de qué es BookTube"", había otros momentos en que los sentimientos de Emma con respecto a subir su primer vídeo, al recibir su primer comentario, al ser reconocida e ir creciendo, etc... me eran tremendamente familiares. Vamos, en pocas palabras, me sentía identificada... no con ella, sino con la felicidad que hacer vídeos le proporciona, con sus dudas al principio, con ese tipo de cosas.

Pero bueno, a pesar de todo esto, siento que sí hay fallas en esta novela. Hay situaciones que llevan una gran carga dramática, sobre todo cuando a la familia de Emma se refiere, que se despachan demasiado rápido y sin muchas consecuencias. Creo que podría haberse ahondado un poco más en el impacto emocional que dichas situaciones podían tener en la historia y los personajes, pues a veces sentía algunas discusiones o revelaciones muy en plan ""oh, okay, pues nada, sigamos con la vida""... ¡y eran cosas muy fuertes!

Hay otro punto que me molestó, y esto ya no es de la historia como tal, sino de la forma: sé que el que las amigas de WhatsApp de Emma escribieran con errores y typos trataba de reflejar la realidad del mundo virtual en los jóvenes, pero ¿qué necesidad había de que estas dos chicas escribieran en idioma Orco Narniano durante todo el libro? A mí ese detalle no me convenció mucho porque, vamos, se supone que estas chicas son y por eso, diría yo, tendrían que escribir bien así estuvieran hablando por chat, pero .

Vamos con los :

Al principio del libro sentí que sus diálogos eran un poco postizos, pero a medida que fui avanzando se fueron naturalizando un poco, al menos en mi opinión. Si bien los personajes de Besos Entre Líneas no son absolutamente memorables, sí que te dejan una impresión mientras lees el libro. Emma con su ingenuidad e introspección; Eric con su pinta de chico malo y gamberro pero con un gran secreto a cuestas; y, por supuesto, todos los y de la vida real que hacen su aparición en la historia bajo nombres clave. Esto último me pareció graciosísimo y me gustó hacer el ejercicio a lo largo del libro de identificar quién era quién, jajaja.

Creo que las interacciones que más disfrutaba a lo largo de Besos Entre Líneas eran las de Emma-Eric y Emma-Gabriel. Me gustaba la dicotomía entre esas dos relaciones, pues una de ellas impulsaba a Emma a ser más arriesgada, a enamorarse y a confiar en otra persona a pesar de sus secretos; mientras que la otra fluía de manera más sencilla, a pesar del que pendía sobre ellos.

Un punto muy positivo de Gabriel: en cierto momento exteriorizó TODO lo que me molesta de BookTube... Por ejemplo: que la gente crea que el único tema de conversación posible contigo sean tus vídeos. Pero bueno, en fin... Del personaje de Gabriel me gustó que ayuda a poner muchas cosas en perspectiva dentro del libro, es ese personaje que le da el punto de quiebre a la historia y que la encauza hacia su final. Había momentos en que lo adoraba y había momentos en los que no sabía muy bien qué pensar de él; sin embargo, esa ambivalencia era atractiva.

Creo que ya hablé un poco más de la cuenta y esto está larguísimo, pero no quiero terminar esta reseña/opinión sin decir que NUNCA juzguen un libro sin leerlo. Yo tenía muchísimo miedo al empezar Besos Entre Líneas porque las críticas eran fatales y sabía que tanto si me gustaba como si no se iba a armar la de Troya. Si no me gustaba, me ponía en una situación complicada porque a Esme y a May las aprecio mucho... y, si me gustaba, las personas pensarían que había amañado mi opinión precisamente por ese afecto. Sin embargo, ahora, habiendo terminado el libro, puedo decir con que disfruté mucho de Besos Entre Líneas a pesar de las fallas que, en mi opinión, tiene. Así que los invito a leerlo, a dar su opinión de manera respetuosa y a querer volver desesperadamente a Madrid y a la BLC, que fue lo que, en últimas, el libro produjo en mí :)"
Besos entre líneas,Laura Bergen,"January 30, 2019",1.0,"He estado pensando mucho si escribir una reseña de esta historia o no; ya hay muchas que reflejan mi opinión (y no solo opinión, sino crítica fundamentada) de este desastre. Solo subrayaré los puntos que para mí son más importantes o los que no se han tratado tanto:

1. Por culpa de libros como este se generaliza sobre lo mala que es la literatura juvenil, lo tóxica que es la novela romántica y la falta de seriedad y calidad de los que publican. Es el ejemplo perfecto, desgraciadamente, de que sí, a veces las críticas aplastantes son completamente ciertas, y por este motivo eclipsan a los /escritores decentes.

2. Aunque soy partidaria de la muerte al autor, esta vez no puedo ignorar la completa incoherencia entre lo que una de las autoras dice y lo que plasma en este libro, porque mucha labia de feminismo pero luego la historia no puede ser más cliché y machista. Ah, y eso sin contar todo el tema de .

3. No, señores, a esto no es correcto llamarlo literatura; literatura conlleva una calidad literaria (esto es, corrección sintáctica, ortográfica, tipográfica; uso de recursos literarios; diálogos naturales; descripciones; y un largo etcétera), unos personajes mínimamente verosímiles, una trama (¿qué trama?) que no se desmorone por sí misma, una ambientación convincente. Este libro no tiene nada de eso. Lo único que tiene de bueno es su agilidad. Pero, no sé, un cuaderno de dibujos o una telenovela también son entretenidos.

4. Es una auténtica vergüenza que una editorial haya apostado por esto mientras cientos de personas que escriben maravillas se quedan con una mano delante y otra detrás. Grupo Planeta, muchos ya sabíamos que buscabais el dinero y más dinero, pero esto ya no es que sea discutible como novela, es que es una auténtica falta de profesionalidad. Y, que conste, por vuestra culpa habéis hecho que dos chicas se crean algo que no son y/o se hayan llevado un guantazo de realidad tras la publicación.

5. Es una falta de responsabilidad y respeto la absoluta ausencia de documentación y delicadeza en los temas tocados. Digo responsabilidad porque estas chicas tienen muchos seguidores, seguidores jóvenes y muy influenciables que van a creer a pies juntillas que una relación como la de Emma y Eric o Emma y Gabriel son sanas, que la anorexia se cura con un comentario lloroso y que es sinónimo de vomitar, ni más ni menos, que una mujer se puede quedar embarazada tras un transtorno alimenticio como si tal cosa, que el cáncer consiste en dos operaciones en el hospital y en llevar peluca, que cuidar a alguien con una fuerte minusvalía psíquico-física se resume en ducharlo, limpiarle la saliva o leerle un libro, que el hecho de que tu madre se haya matado en un accidente no te hace madurar ni aprender de las dificultades de la vida; que si pides perdón ya no pasa nada por ser responsable de la muerte de alguien, que los profesores de literatura, ¡horror!, odian la literatura (juvenil) y son unos carcas, que saltarse las clases para irte con tu novio no conlleva un suspenso ni lleva al fracaso escolar, que por leer a Jane Austen y a Bukowski eres filólogo, que porque un libro te enganche ya es una obra maestra, que tener una madurez mental de 12 años cuando tienes 17 está bien, que amor es sexo y sexo es amor, que por tener una vida difícil tienes derecho a ser egocéntrico y/o imbécil, que la autocompasión y el lamentarse continuamente es algo natural en alguien que ha sufrido, que eres friqui y raro por leer libros, que ser desagradecido con tu familia es el pan de cada día. Y podría seguir, pero creo que ya habéis captado la idea.

6. Por último quiero dirigirme a los amantes de este libro o a sus autoras, y en general a todos los que piensan que este libro ha sufrido ""una campaña de acoso y derribo"": en esta página web que está hecha por y para lectores, esta """"""""novela"""""""" ha sufrido muchas, muchas críticas, OJO, objetivas y totalmente fundamentadas. Sí, la inmensa mayoría de las reseñas son negativas, muchas con humor ácido, memes, , etcétera, pero solo una minoría cae en el insulto o las descalificaciones personales (repito, personales, porque ¿ahora ya no se puede opinar sobre la obra en sí o qué?). Supongo que habrá sido duro para las autoras ver tanta crítica junta, pero, por una vez, la objetividad ha destacado sobre la subjetividad o la opinión. ¿Que hay libros peores? Sí, pero o no están publicados (con toda razón) o no han sido publicitados así (con la caradura de decir que es un libro bueno), al menos en España, o no han tenido ese salseo turbio de cuentas de Twitter hackeadas o puntuaciones de cuentas fantasma aquí en Goodreads. Las cosas como son: . Quien lo niegue no sabe separar la realidad del gusto personal.


Por último, para quien quiera profundizar sobre estos problemas (diferencia criterio/gusto, lenguaje literario, machismo, este libro), os recomiendo:

Besos entre líneas,Alexandra,"April 18, 2016",1.0,"Vamos a ver...

Que los booktubers son influencers es un hecho, está pasando y no hay nada que podamos hacerle. Y como hemos podido comprobar, el mundo de los influencers, los nuevos ídolos que ""dan las pautas"" para sus seguidores mediante las nuevas plataformas tecnológicas, es el mundo adonde todas las cosas buenas van a morir.

Este es un ejemplo muy ilustrativo.

Emma, nuestra narradora, es una chica que lee muuuuuucho. Lo que más le gusta de todo el mundo son los libros, su olor favorito es el de la biblioteca, lo que hace antes de meterse en la cama es leer, siempre que puede está leyendo libros. También tiene que ayudar a su padre, que ha quedado discapacitado tras un accidente que acabó con la vida de su madre, pero claro, es un poco peñazo de cuidar a quien te ha dado la vida si tienes entre manos el nuevo libro de John Green.

Luego está Eric, que no es un protagonista masculino al uso. Es malo, fuma porros. Y además de malo, es misterioso, está atormentado por un fantasma de su pasado que le ha hecho cerrarse al mundo y adoptar esta faceta de héroe byroniano. Además, sujétate, María Teresa, es guapo. Muy guapo. Tan guapo que te puede hacer olvidar que te acosa sexualmente por la calle y el consentimiento es una cosa de la que los tipos martirizados por los terribles acontecimientos de su juventud no son conscientes. ¿Para qué, si es guapo? Y por si fuera poco, lee a Bukowski. Es un hombre y lee a Bukowski (no me extrañaría nada que perteneciese a un club de lucha del que no pueda hablar y que el 5 de noviembre se dedicase a grabar vídeos para Anonymous con la careta de V). Para que se note que además de guapo es culto. No sabemos muy bien qué libro de Bukowski estaba leyendo, pero eso importa más bien poco. Que Bukowski fuese un misógino y que sus libros son cuanto menos problemáticos es irrelevante. Era Bukowski.

Bueno, pues, Emma y Eric acaban juntos *gasps* Emma y Eric se acuestan juntos. Sin condón. Así porque sí. Pero no os alarméis. Es porque Eric es guapo y es una verdad universalmente conocida que si un guapo te magrea sin consentimiento, también hay un 100% de probabilidades que haga la marcha atrás de forma infalible (ya que, bueno, lo importante es que nadie se quede embarazada, ¿cómo van los guapos a transmitir algún tipo de ets? ¿Estamos locos? ¡Que son guapos!).

Así, de pasada, Emma vive con su tía (que la acoge, la aliementa, la mantiene, le da dinero para caprichos, pero es malísima porque no le deja leer ni estar con su blog, menuda bruja incomprensiva), tiene que cuidar de su padre enfermo, tiene una amiga que es lesbiana (que ella ya lo sabía porque es muy perspicaz esta chica, ojo cuidao, que Emma ya se lo olía porque la amiga en cuestión se fijaba en los personajes femeninos en los libros), se indigna mucho con su profesora de literatura porque es una inepta y que por supuesto La Selección tiene el mismo valor literario que el Ulises de Joyce, se hace booktuber, va a la BLC, tiene así como un ligoteo con otro chico porque la chica es así costumbrista, ella ve encanto y maravilla en todos los clichés habidos y por haber, vuelve con Eric, no da palo al agua a pesar de estar en 2º de bach y poco más.

¿En qué momento alguien pensó que esto iba a engañar a alguien? Si metes en una historia todos los tópicos que tú mismx criticas fervientemente en tus book-hauls, en tus wrap-ups y en tus demás secciones despechadas porque no hay expresión en inglés para ellos, sin reinventarlos, tratar de satirizarlos o innovar de alguna forma, ¿qué es lo que pretendes exactamente? No lo entiendo, juro que no lo entiendo. No entiendo cómo dos personas que predican a los cuatro vientos que AMAN la literatura, que los libros y los libros y que qué bien los libros, una de ellas manteniendo la posición de feminista empedernida en todo momento (ojo, que está muy bien eso, una actitud que, qué cosa tan curiosa, en el libro feminismo, lo que se dice hay más bien poco, por no decir que brilla por su ausencia), escriben esta retahíla de situaciones torpemente unificadas por casualidades metidas con calzados y herramientas narrativas mal empleadas digeridas y regurgitadas por el público al que va dirigido esta novela una y otra vez (todo el mundo se sonroja mucho, todo el mundo contiene la respiración, el instituto es una mierda, las protagonistas son siempre genios en bruto incomprendidas por profesoras de literatura que, obviamente, no se ha leído las ventajas de ser un marginado y no sabe ver un clásico entre clásicos).

En serio, este libro se ha escrito mediante dos cabezas pensantes, ¿por qué tiene tan poca identidad propia? ¿Cualquier tipo de señal distintiva? ¿Algo? ¿Lo que sea? He de simpatizar con la pobre Emma y lo mal que lo ha pasado, pero, francamente, Emma me da mucha vergüenza. Es una quinceañera con un ego más grande que ella misma a la que el hilo narrativo no hace más que apoyar y respaldar (¡con 12 años haces esto, con 12 años escribes sobre versiones idealizadas de ti mismx a las que no hacen más pasarles tragedias que afrontan con valentía, humildad y sabiduría porque, claro, eres tú y eres incapaz de hacerte autocrítica! Ahora explicadme cómo demonios se escribe sobre mary sues con 20 tacos ya y un millar de libros leídos a la espalda). Emma es como esa etapa de los 15 años que no se consiguió superar (dice ""mundo mundial"", POR DIOS), la special snowflake que es superior a todos los demás por LEER LIBROS y SER FRIKI.

En definitiva, esta es la confirmación de que los aporramientos al teclado de nuestros yos adolescentes no eran en vano, los puede comprar Planeta.

Que Cthulhu nos acoja (Emma es friki pero esta referencia no la entendería porque no es de un libro juvenil y todo lo que hay que saber del mundo está en los libro juveniles)."
Besos entre líneas,Athena Reader,"April 18, 2016",1.0,"Opinión resumida : Besos entre líneas es una historia plana, aburrida y horriblemente escrita sobre una insulsa booktuber. ¿Pero qué mierda es ésta?



: Hace tiempo que no leía un libro tan increíblemente malo. Mira que mis expectativas eran bajísimas, tratándose de un producto de youtubers y no una obra de escritores de verdad (entendiendo por ""de verdad"" a gente que se dedica a escribir para ganarse el pan, no para aprovechar su fama y sacarse un dinerillo publicando cualquier tontería), pero francamente, ha resultado aún peor de lo que esperaba. Plagado de errores de ortográficos, gramaticales y tipográficos (claramente se han ahorrado el sueldo de un corrector) y con un estilo narrativo un peldaño por debajo de lo que se consideraría amateur, Besos entre líneas no vale la vida de los árboles que se han talado para imprimirlo.

Emma es una bloguera literaria (¡anda, qué casualidad, como las autoras!) que se convierte en booktuber (como las autoras) y todo el libro consiste en una sucesión de referencias a todo libro juvenil habido y por haber insertadas con calzador de la manera más absurda posible. Literalmente (¿o debería decir ""literariamente""?) cada página o cada par de ellas tiene alguna referencia a algún libro, y a veces se suceden varias en la misma página. Pero no vayáis a pensar que menciona los títulos por algo, no, es la estúpida manera de tratar de conectar con el lector en plan """". Por supuesto, de vez en cuando hace alguna referencia a Jane Austen o a Bukowski para que parezca que la protagonista es culta y lee de todo. Meh.

Es habitual que muchos libros juveniles tengan paja y diálogos de relleno, pero Besos entre líneas va incluso más allá: , incluyendo descripciones detalladas (de varias páginas) sobre su proceso de grabación de vídeos para youtube o su fangirleo infantil al acudir a algún evento literario (presentaciones, firmas de libros, BLC, feria del libro...). ¿Pero a quién carajo le interesa leer cómo grabas los vídeos, si se te acaba la batería y no sabes usar el programa de edición, lo que te parecen los vídeos de tu booktuber diva favorita, cómo le haces la pelota a los autores de moda o lo muchísimo que te gusta ""Las ventajas de ser un marginado""?. Páginas y páginas dando sus opiniones sobre libros populares, sin que aporte absolutamente nada a la trama, incluyendo una absurda escena en defensa de la literatura juvenil en clase de lengua que no viene a cuento de nada más que de tratar de que el lector empatice con la protagonista al ver que comparte el mismo punto de vista. .

No voy a entrar a describir la trama en detalle PORQUE NO LA HAY, ni a comentar lo que me parecen los protagonistas, porque son un cliché andante y vergonzoso. Cualquier cuento escrito para clase de lengua por una niña de primaria tiene más calidad y contenido que esta ""cosa"".

En resumen: protagonista tonta, interés amoroso malote y guapísimo (énfasis en su atractivo en TODOS los capítulos) con un ""oscuro"" pasado (que resulta no ser nada oscuro), que caen en un instalove con sexo sin protección incluído. Se ve que a las autoras les sonaba más romántica la idea de que Emma, una chica virgen e inexperta, tenga sexo con el malote de Eric al poco tiempo de conocerle, sin darle mayor importancia al hecho de que sea su primera vez y sin saber apenas nada del pasado del chico ""malo"". Vamos, que podría haberla dejado embarazada o transmitirle alguna ETS, pero hey, qué más da, es un libro para fans , ¿por qué preocuparse por detalles como ese?.

Algunos aspectos del libro me recuerdan a Crepúsculo y otros a After pero, aunque parezca increíble, cualquiera de esos títulos está mucho mejor escrito que Besos entre líneas."
Besos entre líneas,Evelyn Torres,"December 29, 2016",1.0,"0.5 estrellas y creo que nunca odie un libro tanto como este.

TIENE SPOILERS, pero como no lo recomiendo para leer, yo diria que lean la reseña tranquilos jajaja

Cuando las autoras anunciaron que habia escrito este libro y que iban a lanzarlo con planeta, sinceramente, me emocione mucho porque seguia bastante sus canales de booktube y porque en ese momento tenia un poco de fe que fuera bueno teniendo en cuenta su nivel de lectura y critica...

Despues del lanzamiento y al leer comentarios, empece a sentir que iba a tener que ser bastante cuidadosa con la lectura, pero les di el beneficio de la duda, hasta que en Agosto el libro llego a mis manos y tuve mi oportunidad de juzgar el libro por mi misma (cosa que siempre me gusta hacer, porque no creo que este bien juzgar algo sin conocer, o en este caso, leerlo)

Siendo honesta creo que lo unico que le encontre de positivo al libro es que se lee super rapido. Me lei las primeras 250 paginas en 1 dia (viaje de ida y vuelta a la universidad) y llegado ese punto estaba super decidida a terminarlo pero... me estanque y decidi dejarlo.

El libro tiene las tipicos componentes de una historia cliche de wattpad o fanfic cargada de un drama innecesario que sobrepasa los limites. Y ustedes saben que mi guilty pleasure son los dramas de wattpad o fanfic, pero este libro lo senti DEMASIADO exagerado y hasta en cierto momentos me senti bastante insultada.

Empezando por Emma, la protagonista, es demasiado egoista, demasiado creida, demasiado autocompasiva, etc. Emma es demasiado todo, menos cosas positivas. No logre conectar con ella en ningun momento de la historia, ni siquiera como booktuber o lectora.

Yo entiendo que la vida de las personas sean complicas... pero poner una protagonista que: 1. perdio a su madre en un accidente de auto, 2. su padre quedo con muchas secuelas del mismo accidente, y no puede hablar y caminar entre otras cosas, por lo que vive en una residencia especial donde lo cuidan, 3. ella y su hermana quedan a cargo de su tia, 4. a raiz del accidente de sus padres su hermana sufre de anorexia, 5. incluir una persona con cancer en la historia, 6. la muerte de una ex-novia en un accidente de coche tambien, 7. y no nos olvidemos que tambien se involucran las drogas. 8. Ah, y casi me olvido del chico mexicano con el que se desarrolla un triangulo amoroso.

Por favor, no me digan que todo esto no es demasiado drama. Y encima de una manera que es DEMASIADO.

Ahora teniendo en cuenta el drama, la protagonista en general actua de esta manera:
1. en relacion a la muerte de su madre se comporta bastante normal, porque es algo doloroso y no lo juzgo, pero 2. como es que con su madre se lamenta y la extraña pero con su padre no siente que es mas que una carga para ella, cuando SOLO LO VISITA LOS FINES DE SEMANAS Y EN LA MAYORIA DE LA NOVELA NI SIQUIERA EN ESOS MOMENTOS LOS PASA CON SU PAPA. 4. Cuando se habla de su hermana y su pasado relacionado con la anorexia no hace mas que culparla e incluso las cosas que hace ""para ayudarla"" no son mas que insultantes y tratadas de una manera horrible. 5. ¿Querian mas drama? Vamos, incluyamos cancer y vamos a sentirnos mal por Eric y ser super compresivas con el, pero no con tu familia. 6. y tambien entendamos a Eric por haber provocado la muerte de su ex-novia cuando ambos se subieron a una moto (si no me equivoco, era moto) estando el borracho... pero no vayamos a perdonar al que mato a tus papas... digo, si vamos a hacer asi, seamos asi con todos. 7. y tambien perdonemos a eric por ser un chico cualquiera que encontramos en la libreria y que nos besa asi de la nada y nos mete droga en el bolsillo del pantalon para que la policia no lo arreste a él. 8. Y la frutilla del postre... incluyamos a un personaje mexicano (que de hecho es practicamente un insulto para los mexicanos y todos los latinos) que provoca un triangulo amoroso que da pena.

¿Como no me va a gustar esta historia si pasan estas cosas? Empezando por las muertes, las enfermedades, las drogas, etc. Yo soy de esas personas que se fijan mucho en la manera en que se tratan estas situaciones y en este libro se tratan de una manera horrible.

Ah, y no nos olvidemos de que ¡Emma es booktuber! De verdad que me empache de tantas referencias a libros que lei en esta historia. Ademas del hecho de que es tan dificil que consigas 100 o 200 visitas en tu primer video de youtube EN TU PRIMER DIA EN LA PLATAFORMA CUANDO NO CONOCES A NADIE. De verdad, todo lo relacionado a booktube en este libro lo odie mucho.

Pero lo que mas odie de este libro son los fucking mensajes que se enviaba Emma con su amigas, COMO ES POSIBLE QUE ALGUIEN QUE LEE TANTO ESCRIBA TAN MAL??!?!?!?!

Y el hecho de que cuando una de las amigas de Emma les dice que es gay, Emma dice ""ya me parecia... porque siempre le gustaban mas las protagonistas femeninas"" WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!!??!? ARE U FUCKING KIDDING ME????

Despues de leer este libro las autoras me decepcionaron tanto...

No recomiendo el libro y dudo que quiera volver a leer algo de ellas. Es insultante por donde lo mires."

Es cierto que no es el libro del año y que tiene sus fallos, pero nadie nace sabiendo.
El objetivo fundamental de un libro es entretener. Y el objetivo de una reseña es dar una opinión sincera y RESPETUOSA y no criticar sin fundamento e intentar ir a hacer daño. (A ver si esto último lo aprende mucha gente).

Dicho esto, vuelvo a repetir, el libro no ha sido el libro del año, pero me ha entretenido (por lo tanto ha logrado su objetivo), me ha enganchado y ha tenido cosas que me han gustado más (todo lo relacionado con el mundo de los libros, BLC, BookTuber...) y cosas que me han gustado menos (los clichés y el superpoder de Eric de salir de debajo de las piedras), pero NO ES TAN MAL libro como lo pintan."

Besos entre líneas,Ariadna,"April 14, 2016",1.0,"Bueno... Vamos a ver.
He empezado ""Besos entre líneas"" esta misma tarde y en un par de horas ya lo había terminado. Sinceramente no tenía planeado hacer una reseña de este libro, pero varias personas me lo han pedido personalmente, así que voy a dejar una pequeña opinión argumentando lo que me ha parecido.
Mi principal problema con esta historia es que tenía la impresión de que estaba leyendo un libro con muchísimas lagunas, como si estuviera inacabado y aún le quedaran muchísimas cosas por perfilar.
La trama es muy sencilla, pero se desarrolla todo de una manera tan plana e ilógica que no he llegado a a creerme nada de lo que ocurría. Lo mismo me ha pasado con los personajes: No he conseguido conectar con ninguno (Emma me resulta desesperadamente pava e inmadura). Los secundarios tienen comportamientos irreales, y el triángulo amoroso está totalmente fuera de lugar. Quiero remarcar las TERRIBLES faltas de ortografía que hay en los whatssaps que se envían Emma y sus amigas. A ver, puedo entender que se quiera hacer ""realista"" añadiendo faltas, pero parece que estaba escribiendo un animal cabreado. Han habido veces que he tenido que leer dos veces la frase para entenderla...
Como suele pasar en las novelas escritas a cuatro manos, se notan los cambios de estilo entre las dos autoras. Creo que habría sido propicio una revisión más exhaustiva para unificar la prosa.
En fin, que en ningún aspecto he llegado a conectar con la historia: Se me ha hecho aburrida, previsible, llena de tópicos y referencias innecesarias. Creo que alguna vez ya lo he comentado, pero siempre hace gracia leer un libro que tenga alguna referencia a algo que conocemos, pero no soporto leer un libro que tiene una media de cuatro referencias por página. Es desesperante."

No le pongo 1 estrella por el simple hecho de que me entretuve marcando todas y cada una de las referencias que habían de libros/autores/personajes los cuales dejaré para el final.

Comenzando con mi opinión, quiero hablar un poco muy por encima, sin ahondar mucho sobre las autoras

Me da demasiada pena leer tantas críticas negativas sobre el primer libro publicado de Esmeralda. El que tu primer novela publicada tenga tanto rechazo, puede ser un tanto duro.

Por otra parte... .

No he encontrado nada de ni nada que elimine la de la cual tanto se ha quejado May últimamente.



¿Estos son los ideales feministas que tanto defiende May? Qué pasa con la típica frase de que ""les molestan que se la pasen tratándolas como objetos, mirándoles el pecho o culo"" y ahora que puede, lo usa a su favor?

Y me pregunto... con qué cara van a poder criticar después una novela por un amor forzado, por un desarrollo de trama pobre o nulo, por cosas sin sentido, por falta de madurez en la escritura o lo que sea.
Porque sí, todos nos quejamos de que siempre las relaciones sean en un típico con un pero al momento de tener que escribir una novela hacen todo lo que criticaban antes. ¿Por qué? Porque vende.

Teniendo la oportunidad de cambiar estos que tanto se ven en la literatura juvenil y no la aprovechan.
Si vas a hacer esto, después no te quejes de los demás escritores por no promover cosas en sus novelas que vos tampoco.

El único personaje homosexual es Sandra, la amiga de Emma. Pero en lugar de nos meten un estereotipo TÍPICO. A la chica le gustan más los personajes femeninos que los masculinos y nunca la vieron en pareja...

Esperaba muchísimo más de May, ya que siempre nos recalca que viene escribiendo desde los años y ya ha publicado como . De Esme... no sabía qué esperar. No sé si es o no la primera vez que se sienta a escribir, pero me suena más a las primeras historias o fanfics que escribe uno, que a cualquier otra cosa.






Esta novela tiene tantas incoherencias, errores, saltos en el tiempo... tiene todos los habidos y por haber. Hay situaciones creadas única y exclusivamente para que se de cierto encuentro entre personajes, el cual no se hubiese dado de otra forma.
Había un de casualidades y exageraciones, todo el tiempo. Por más que Emma esté en medio del Pacífico, iba a encontrarse con Eric. En un solo video ya sube cientos de suscriptores. Los booktubers tienen millones de seguidores. Todos le quieren entrar a Emma. Emma es genial.

Los romances eran tan forzados, la ""relación"" iba y venía: un día se amaban, al otro no se podían ni ver. Luego se crea un triángulo amoroso innecesario y muy poco creíble. Se todo de forma apresurada, nada se desarrolla.







Aquí algunas frases/pensamientos/situaciones que nos dejan ver bien la forma de ser de Emma y los demás protagonistas de relleno. (Hay spoilers)

+Siguen apareciendo cuentas falsas para subir la calificación del evento circense del año. El modus operandi apenas varía, aunque ahora mantienen los perfiles en privado y no realizan votaciones en masa.

por muchas cuentas falsas que creen, el ""libro"" va a seguir siendo de una calidad paupérrima. Y decir que esto siquiera tiene un granito de calidad es ser generoso.

+Siguen borrando comentarios que no honren la labor de las autoras... Y de los amiguitos de las autoras.





Ya me siento como presentadora de programa de chimentos...



+""Alguien"" sigue borrando comentarios acá y en su Instagram. Así que si piensan decirle directamente que no les gustó su obra, ya saben qué esperar: la reacción de una persona madura y lógica, por supuesto. ¡Ja! , te voy a decir algo (que probablemente no leas, pero me da igual): no importa cuántos comentarios borres: es igual que tratar de tapar el sol con un dedo. Tu libro es malo, malo con ganas, y ya es bien sabido por la comunidad de lectores. Borrar comentarios solo te hace quedar peor, como una niña caprichosa que se niega a ver la realidad y que no admite opinión contraria a la suya. ¿No es que apoyás la libertad de expresión? ¿No es que sos tan feminista? Pues, venga, que se te está viendo la hilacha...



Muchos estamos hartos de que contenidos así sean publicados. La mejor manera de hacerles llegar el mensaje a la editorial es NO COMPRANDO estos . Podemos criticar el material tanto como queramos pero, mientras siga habiendo compradores en cantidad, a la editorial no le va a importar. La mejor movida es esa: . Ahí sí se van a replantear la conveniencia de publicar semejantes bazofias.



Mi masoquismo me obligó a leer (por encima) el primer capítulo y a internarme en una pileta de fragmentos y capturas de este libro. Aprendí mucho, muchísimo, sobre el comportamiento humano y las enfermedades. Gracias, autoras y editorial, por haberme brindado tanto.

—Si un chico que te conoce te acorrala y te mete una bolsa de marihuana en el bolsillo, eso es definitivamente amor.
—Si tenés una hermano/a (o amigo/a o conocido/a) que sufre/sufrió de anorexia, la mejor manera de recibirlo/a cada que lo/a veas es preguntándole si ya adelgazó.
—Si un chico es bonito, tiene pase para hacer lo que quiera. No importa qué haga: todo es admisible/perdonable si tiene unos buenos brazos y una cara matadora.
—Si te gustan los personajes femeninos, es hora de que enfrentes la realidad: sos lesbiana. Y se te ve desde lejos, así que no lo niegues.
—Si tus familiares se preocupan por vos, en realidad es que quieren coartar tu libertad. ¡Esa gente es tan mala y está en contra tuyo!
—Tu prioridad número uno ser tu interés romántico. Nada en tu mundo puede importarte más, ni siquiera vos misma. Él/ella va primero/a, segundo/a y tercero/a también.
—No sos un lector si no leés literatura juvenil, si no olés los libros después de comprarlos y si no introducís una referencia literaria a cada oportunidad que tengas de hablar/pensar/escribir.
—Si no te trata como su propiedad, no es amor.
—México está en Sudamérica.
—Los sudamericanos tienen sangre caliente y por eso van besando a cualquiera que se les cruce.
—En México no tienen idea de la existencia de la palabra ""vergüenza"".
—Si alguien maneja borracho y atropella a alguien, es una atrocidad y dicha persona merece una condena. Ahora, si ese alguien resulta ser tu interés amoroso, no es más que un accidente y conducir en estado de ebriedad no es más que un simple error.

Tomémonos un momento para reflexionar sobre el hecho de que este libro apenas tiene 0,2 puntos más que esto:




No lo voy a negar... Me estoy riendo mucho y feo.
Incluso los libros de Paris Hilton tienen puntuaciones más altas que esto.

Ahora solo me pregunto si Planeta (y demás editoriales) se van a replantear el hecho de publicar cualquier cosa (y no me refiero a que sean libros con una trama mala/repetitiva/nociva, sino al hecho de que de por sí su edición/corrección es/son pésima/s) o si simplemente se están frotando las manitos ante el fenómeno de publicidad boca a boca (¿reseña a reseña?) que estas despiertan.

* * * * *

Entre la enorme cantidad de malas reseñas y el lío de los bots... No puedo evitarlo, me dan ganas de leer esta y ver por mí misma que tan mala es (y reseñarla también, obviamente). He visto videos de las dos autoras (nótese que no las voy a llamar escritoras) y ninguna me inspira expectativa alguna. Bueno, mejor dicho, no me genera expectativas positivas."
Besos entre líneas,Adelia,"January 29, 2016",1.0,"Malísimo, tópico y vergonzoso.
Da vergüenza ajena ver que Planeta sigue publicando libros de contenido tan plano. Entre After y esto..."
Besos entre líneas,Sweety,"November 16, 2017",1.0,"¡Me siento estafada!

Las críticas tenían razón. Con lo que me gusta el romance y me pongo a leer esto. ¡Horas de mi vida que jamás recuperaré!

Bueno, ahora dejando de lado mi primera impresión después de terminar el libro, empezaré a hablar de como me pareció:

Mis expectativas para este libro eran bastante bajas, después de ver y leer un sinfín de reseñas tanto negativas como positivas intenté no dejarme llevar por opiniones ajenas. Sin embargo, la mayoría de estas me parecieron muy bien fundamentadas, por lo que no sabia que creer al respecto. Así que me dije a mí misma que si quería respuestas, entonces tendría que leerlo y analizarlo a mi antojo.

Lastimosamente las criticas negativas eran mucho mas acertadas que las positivas.

""Besos entre líneas"" es exactamente el tipo de historia que años atrás habría leído sin tener mayores quejas. Es una lectura relativamente simple, con casi nada de descripciones y que si desconectas tu cerebro un rato se puede soportar. Termine el libro en mucho menos tiempo del que me esperé (Aunque se sintió como una eternidad) y dada la calificación que le di, en realidad no lo disfrute para nada.

La historia se centra en Emma, una joven adolescente que ""tiene una vida muy dura"", o al menos eso es lo que se da a entender en la sinopsis. Pero detrás de esta descripción lo que tenemos es en realidad a una jovencita que lo único que hace es leer, quejarse, babear por su interés romántico, babear por su crush de internet, ""estudiar"", saltarse clases, hablar de libros, salir con sus amigas de fiesta y un largo etc. En resumen: Todo lo que hace una adolescente como cualquier otra. Esta es una de las miles contradicciones que se encuentran a lo largo del libro.

Evidentemente detesté a Emma, sus cambios repentinos de personalidad me dejaron con un sinsabor que no consigo quitarme. De los únicos personajes en los que se profundiza (O se intenta al menos) son los que presentan un patrón de conducta que cambia con una brusquedad que llegó a confundirme. Centrándonos en Emma, en algunos momentos se comporta como una niña egoísta que no le importa lo que pase más allá de su metro cuadrado, para que luego le agarre un efímero sentimiento de culpabilidad en el que luce arrepentida para que luego vuelva a comportarse de la misma manera. Su conducta es demasiado ilógica, no creo que alguien después de pasar por lo que ella ha pasado se comporte de esta manera.

Hablando de Eric, como dije es uno de los personajes que también presentan estos cambios bruscos. Se nos lo presenta como un chico malo, cuando en realidad es un idiota más. Intentan justificar esta conducta con la constante frase de ""antes no era así"", lo que me parece una excusa muy barata. De la misma manera, Eric pasa por una situación difícil (Que se menciona de paso para dar pena) y al igual que Emma se comporta de una manera absurda. Su situación solo sirve para que se sienta lástima por él, en ves de hacerlo crecer como personaje. Una cosa que creo que intentaron hacer en el final del libro, pero no fue tan creíble.

No hablare tanto de los demás personajes, pues para las autoras parece que estos dos son lo único que importa en el mundo. Todos cumplen con el papel que se les ha impuesto, tanto que una figurilla de cartón podría reemplazarlos y no habría ninguna diferencia:

1. Tenemos a la tía mala que la regaña por las notas y le prohíbe ver al novio (Algo totalmente normal y comprensible, pero como se interpone entre la pareja entonces hay que etiquetarla como la mala).

2. Al novio de la tía que bien podría ser la porrista personal de Emma (Por alguna razón se nos dice al final que no están casados, algo que en realidad no importa mucho pues nos distrae de Emma y Eric).

3. Están las amigas que la apoyan en todo y que solo sirven para decirle lo que la trama requiera ya sea ""Has lo que se te antoje con tu guapísimo pretendiente"" o ""Él no te merece amiga, mejor vete con otro"" (Cuidado leyendo sus conversaciones por WhatsApp, entre mi hermana y yo intentamos descifrarlas y solo conseguimos dolores de cabeza).
a) La primera de ellas es totalmente olvidable, tanto que no sabemos nada de ella aparte de su físico (el cual por cierto también olvide).
b) La segunda solo sirve para hacer de Emma una persona de mente abierta por tener una amiga homosexual. (Ese comentario de los personajes femeninos, DIOS, no lo supero).

4. Esta la hermana mayor de Emma, que la ve como su salvadora a la que le debe todo, porque gracias a ella se recupero de la anorexia. Una situación en la que no se molestaron en informarse, pues incluso yo sabiendo muy poco de este trastorno sé lo horriblemente tratado que fue. (Sin comentarios)

5. El padre de Emma es otro elemento que funciona para dar lastima. Pero lo único que consigue es reflejar lo desagradecida que puede ser una hija y cómo no debes tratar a tus padres. El trato de Emma hacia su padre raya la negligencia.

6. Y no podría faltar Gabriel. Este tipo terminó por arruinar la historia. Además de ser un estereotipo ofensivo, solo sirve para crear drama entre la relación de Emma y Eric. (Aquí se demuestra otro cambio brusco en el comportamiento de Emma: Cuando la besa por primera vez hasta lo disfruta, pero de la nada piensa en Eric y se siente culpable).

Tocando el tema de la trama, me arriesgaré a decir que los dos temas principales (O al menos los únicos que a las autoras le tomaron importancia) son: El romance y BookTube.

Hablando del romance: Nadie ama un buen romance más que yo, pero este libro tiene una de las historias románticas más decepcionante que he leído (Que conste que estoy siendo gentil, pues ganas no me faltan de usar una palabra mas insultante). No hay absolutamente nada de construcción en este romance. Pienso e intento encontrar una razón valida para que estén enamorados y lo único que se me ocurre es: 1. Eric es guapo, 2. Eric es guapo y 3. Eric es guapo. Aparte de eso no hay nada que me haga desear que estén juntos. Cumplen muy bien con el patrón de chica buena y chico malo, pero sin salir de esos moldes. Son una pareja vacía y el drama que los rodea lejos de convertirlos en algo mas interesante, solo cansa al lector. Lo único que nos enseña esta relación es: ""Si tienes un novio guapo hazlo el centro de tu vida"". Háganme el favor. La escena de la hierba fue otra cosa ilógica, nos venden a Emma como una protagonista ""fuerte"", pero con esto solo demuestran lo contrario. Yo en su lugar habría gritado, no me hubiese quedado ahí y mucho menos seguirle el juego. Pero no importa porque Eric es guapo.

Preferiría no mencionar el machismo ya que no estoy muy familiarizada con el tema, pero por como lo mencionan algunas críticas solo puedo decir que sí me parece muy hipócrita que la autora se considere feminista y en su libro romantice las actitudes que siempre critica.

Hablando de BookTube: Solo estoy suscrita a unos tres canales y de vez en cuando veo algunos videos que sean de mi interés. Pero incluso sabiendo muy poco de como se mueve YouTube, sé que es imposible que en tu primer video ya tengas más de cien visitas cuando recién lo subes. En este sentido, bien podría hacerse pasar por un fanfic. Muchos Booktubers están dando criticas positivas solo por la experiencia booktuber de Emma. Pero la experiencia de Emma me parece una falta de respeto, porque hace quedar a las personas que nos gusta leer como unos resentidos sociales que no pueden apartar las narices de los libros, hasta el punto en que no les importa nada más que sus libros. Sí, me gusta leer y ver videos en YouTube, pero no por eso desatendería a mi padre enfermo cuando sé que me necesita.

Podría seguir hablando, pero esto es todo lo que se me ocurre. Aunque una cosa más: EN VERDAD ERAN NECESARIAS TODAS ESAS REFERENCIAS. No tienen ni idea de la cara que puse cuando leí la escena de ""Estoy en llamas"". Y luego mi familia me dice que soy obsesiva. Las referencias, las mini reseñas y la aparición de escritores, fueron agotadoras y no me hicieron sentir identificada ni un poco.

Este libro me estafó. Me prometieron una cosa y termine con una gran decepción."
Besos entre líneas,Anita Vela,"April 26, 2016",3.0,"Reseña: http://anitavelabooks.blogspot.com.es...

Quiero dejar claro que mi reseña es independiente a la relación que pueda tener con las autoras y únicamente os voy a contar mi opinión sobre el libro, solo del libro. Y digo esto por la polémica que está teniendo. Y aviso que no voy a permitir comentarios fuera de lugar porque este es mi pequeño rincón y no quiero malos rollos, ¿vale?

La verdad que es un poco complicado hablar de esta novela porque en general me ha gustado, pero hay muchas cosas que no me han gustado y eso me da un poco de rabia porque la verdad que me esperaba algo diferente.

Sinceramente a mí este tipo de historias suelen gustarme porque son fáciles de leer, bastante entretenidas y me hacen pasar un buen rato leyéndolas. Es cierto que no son grandes novelas, que tienen muchos fallos y son muy criticadas, tanto que te sienten un poco mal porque a ti sí te gusta, entonces no sé… es raro.

Voy a empezar por lo que me ha gustado y dejo para el final lo que no.

Lo que más me ha gustado es el tema de la comunidad literaria. La verdad que con esta parte me sentido muy identificada porque hace un año que empecé con todo esto y prácticamente me han pasado cosas similares y me ha hecho mucha gracia. Al igual que aparezcan algunos Booktubers con los nombres cambiados aunque a mí me ha gustado, es cierto que parece un fanfic al introducir a Booktubers reales, pero me han hecho reír. Y esto me lleva a las referencias de libros que hay repartidas por toda la historia, es otra cosa que me ha gustado porque es lo que hacemos todos en nuestros canales y blogs y entiendo que las autoras hayan querido darle ese toque a la historia aunque se les ha ido un pelín de las manos recomendando… pero aún así me ha parecido un guiño hacia la comunidad literaria. Digamos que todo esto es lo que diferencia esta historia al resto de historias de este tipo.

Los personajes... no me han disgustado del todo. Con Emma he tenido sentimientos encontrados; muchas veces la entendía y otras no. Eric es el que más me ha gustado aunque he visto innecesario el drama que gira a su alrededor, con el drama de Emma creo que hubiera sido suficiente porque es una historia bastante corta para tanto drama y un poquito más de chicha a la trama amorosa no hubiera estado mal. Y los personajes secundarios pues no me ha hecho falta saber más de ellos, no me disgusta ninguno aunque la tía es la que más me ha gustado de todos ellos. Y tampoco me ha molestado el tema de los WhatsApp, será porque tengo una amiga que escribe igual. Y no me olvido de Gabriel, después os hablo de él.

En cuanto a la historia de amor… He de decir que me ha gustado aunque empieza raro, la situación es un poco forzada y sucede muy rápido todo, pero luego me ha terminado por convencer aunque me ha faltado un poco más de amorío, como ya he dicho antes.

Y las cosas que no me han gustado han sido:

-El comportamiento de Emma hacia su padre que no lo he llegado a entender, me ha parecido una actitud egoísta por parte de Emma. Y esto me lleva a la trama del padre... Entiendo la crítica social que las autoras quieren transmitir, pero creo que para que fuera una crítica con fundamento debería de haber un hombre en la familia, por ejemplo: un hermano del padre o un hermano de Emma que pasara absolutamente de cuidarlo y que fueran las mujeres de la familia quién se tienen que encargar de cuidar al hombre. Porque si solo hay mujeres en la familia… obviamente ellas tienen que cuidarlo, ¿no?
-El triángulo amoroso es otra cosa que me ha patinado bastante y para mi gusto es muy forzado y sinceramente me hubiera gustado más que se hubieran centrado más en la relación de Eric y Emma porque al final esa historia de amor se me ha quedado corta por meter a Gabriel de por medio. Además que me ha parecido un personaje muy odioso.
-Vale, sé que quién me conozca me saltará con el momento “perro atado a una farola”. Y no, no me ha gustado, jamás de los jamases dejaría a uno de mis perros atado a una farola por entrar en un librería, pero quitando ese momento, me ha gustado que haya un perrillo en la historia, ya sabéis que me gustan mucho.

En resumen, Besos entre líneas es una historia más de este género, pero es perfecta para leer entre lecturas más densas y desconectar un rato."

Repito: ¿Esto es en serio? ¿Planeta, realmente me han cobrado por este libro? RIP al árbol, tu muerte ha sido en vano, lo siento.

No quiero repetir lo que ya se ha dicho en otras reseñas, pero, dios santo... Me arden los ojos. Esto no tiene un mínimo de corrección, y no me refiero a los mensajes mal escritos e indescifrables que la prota se enviaba con las amigas, no, necesita una corrección de estilo urgente, en especial las partes escritas por Esme, las escenas eran todas inconexas, la pluma plana, plana, PLANA (que la de May, no se ha quedado atrás, pero se nota un poco más trabajada, aunque nada muy rescatable). Vale, estoy siendo mala, lo sé, pero pagué por el jodido libro y me siento estafada. Sabía que era una lectura más para adolescentes y que con mis 23 primaveras estoy ""vieja"" para estas historias, pero esto ya es una falta de respeto, parece un fanfic sacado de la fantasía de una niña de 13 años (que yo a los 13 me imaginaba situaciones como la del chico malote-guapo arrinconándome de buenas a primeras y plantándome un beso, y siendo borde conmigo, porque me gustaba el drama y ser una Mary Sue. Y estar en un triángulo amoroso con el malote y el bueno de turno, ambos muy misteriosos. Mi pasado me condena, sí xD, pero tenía 13 años, estas chicas ya están creciditas para escribir así).

Lo que más me encabrona, aparte de mi jodido dinero jajaja, es que en sus reseñas despotrican contra libros como el que ACABAN DE ESCRIBIR.

La protagonista es de las peores que leí en literatura juvenil, y la forma en la que trata a su hermana y cómo habla de su padre es repulsiva.

Ni voy a ponerme a analizar a los personajes porque son planos y típicos.

DEVUELVANME MI DINERO!!! :P"
Besos entre líneas,Isa,"June 21, 2016",1.0,"Me esperaba algo mucho peor que lo que he leído dado los comentarios tan negativos que ha recibido el libro en las últimas semanas. Para mí es una historia que pasa sin pena ni gloria, simplemente eso... creo que le falta mucho para ser un libro que pueda ser publicado y ya está publicado, para mí ese es el mayor problema, el ¿hasta donde vamos a llegar? Si no te molestas ni en corregir un texto y lo sacas de esta manera... ¿qué va a ser lo siguiente?

Es una historia que se podría haber leído en whatpadd y a la que probablemente no le hubieran puesto demasiadas pegas, pero de ahí a pagar lo que cuesta pensando que han tenido criterio a la hora de publicarlo... va un abismo.

Pero no me ha hecho enfadar, que ya es mucho... no lo he encontrado terriblemente ofensivo como he leído o visto en algunos vídeos. Para mí es un fanfic, un tópico detrás de otro y además no sabe mantener el suspense porque todas las supuestas sorpresas o los oscuros secretos de los personajes son muy, muy, muy evidentes.

Pero tampoco es que sea el primero que se publica en este sentido (y con autores de mucho renombre) y no va a ser el último.

Creo que el problema lo tienen las editoriales y no los autores, porque ellos son los responsables de sacar lo que sacan al mercado y creo que si a cualquiera de nosotros, hasta a mí, que no escribo, nos ofrecen publicar un libro... pocos diríamos que no."
Besos entre líneas,A Meneses,"May 3, 2016",1.0,"No sé qué decir...

Esperaba con ansias esta novela porque sigo a las autoras y me gusta lo que hacen, pero al final ha sido una gran decepción. :(
_
Ok, voy a hacer algo que me da un poco de miedo, porque hay gente IRL que me sigue, pero bueno. Uff. Voy a dejar la reseña de mi blog ""secreto"" porque simplemente tengo que hacerlo.

Sinceramente soy seguidora de Esme y May en sus canales de Youtube, las sigo en Goodreads y realmente me gusta lo que hacen. Esme es una chica muy dulce y divertida y May tiene opiniones muy interesantes.

Por eso me sabe mal escribir mal de su libro. Porque entiendo la ilusión con la que lo publicaron. Porque queria que, si no una novela increible, algo divertido y con un romance que me llegara. Y desgraciadamente no fue así.

Hay muchas reseñas que hablan de este libro, si buscas, encontrarás reseñas divertidas con las líneas más desafortunadas o ranteos enormes. Y por eso es que quiero centrarme más en el romance. Pero me pongo de acuerdo con todos que: las referencias a la literatura, blogs, etc. fueron demasiadas y mal incluidas, en lugar de hacerme sentir identificada, me sacaban de la lectura. También las enfermedades de varios personajes secundarios fueron pobremente llevadas y si, hasta eran ofensivas. Gabriel era un cliché de mexicano con tintes racistas (sangre de fuego, ¿enserio?) (y además debieron haber revisado el texto con un mexicano de verdad) Y como miembro de la comunidad LGBT me sentí muy ofendida con como se uso a la amiga de Emma para parecer que era un texto diverso. Lo que más le faltó fue revisión, revisión y más revisión. Algunas oraciones eran extrañas; si, se lee rápido (por las oraciones cortas), pero el ritmo no tenía sentido, y hay muchas incoherencias.

Pero ahora sí. El romance que me enrollo:

Había una vez una chica muy egoista que creía que era muy inteligente. Encontró a alguien y se enamoró. Empezó a mentir, a dejar a su familia de lado, hizo berrinche en momentos importantes y le hizo mucho daño a quienes la rodeaban. Si, tenía amigos, pero si no estaba bien con él, sentía una nube gris encima de ella. Él la engañaba, le hacía daño, le hacía creer que era lo máximo y luego le hacia creer que todo era su culpa. El abuso verbal entre ambos escaló con el paso de los años. Ella lo hizo su mejor amigo, su hermano, su confidente, su pareja. No podía disfrutar de nada cuando estaban lejos, no podía dejar de hablar con el un solo día, no le pedía explicaciones por si ""se enojaba"", le disculpaba todo. Él le hizo sentir que la vida tenía otros colores, la hizo sentir como nadie.

Y ella espera no sentirse otra vez así en toda su vida.

Como pueden imaginarse, esta relación no acabó bien. Después de tres años de relación tormentosa, destructiva y codependiente, terminé deprimida, traicionada de la peor manera y sabiendo exactamente cuando fue el peor día de mi vida.

Y es que se supone que debía ""saber mejor"". Nadie me iba a decir como vestirme ni me iba a dejar el ojo morado. Nadie me iba a decir con quien salir ni a revisar mis mensajes. Y eso no pasó. Pero ahora sé que estuve en una relación abusiva y horrible.

Y la verdad es que me sentí muy triste cuando me identifiqué con Emma. Porque yo también gritaba y no dejaba que me explicara nada. Porque yo también era capaz de mentir para ver a alguien cuando tenía que hacer algo importante. Porque yo también creía que alguien debía mostrarme los colores del mundo. Porque yo también pensaba en él cuando estaba con alguien más. Y me parte el corazón ver que esto es considerado romance, cosa que no es.

Entiendo que algo así no se escribe con mala intención, pero este libro pasó por varias manos, y toda la trama es una relación destructiva, ¡alguien se tuvo que haber dado cuenta!. Es que estoy harta de encontrarme con novelas de vez en cuando que retraten a la codependencia como amor del bueno. Que amor puede ser, pero algo que te consume en vez de construirte no está bien. (Y luego las chicas como yo, al leer estas cosas, nos creemos que este es amoooooor y que es algo a lo que debemos aspirar.)

Emma no creció al conocer a Eric, no se dió cuenta que debía dejar de obsesionarse tanto con el internet, porque en ningún momento dejó de hacerlo. (Aunque al final lo diga) Ella siguió igual hasta el último punto. Y no es que no se le pueda dar una segunda oportunidad a alguien como Eric, una decisión cuestionable, pero que puede pasar; pero es que todo fue tan pobremente llevado que no entiendo como es que Emma lo perdonó, como es que algo tiene sentido. A la mejor porque era guapo...

El final es terrible. Alerta de spoilers (aunque espero que se ahorren este novela),


Spoiler de Gabriel:



Al final quedé muy decepcionada, enojada y triste. Conforme avanzaba el libro recordaba cosas feas y me daban ganas de lanzarlo por la ventana. Y es que es feo que alguien que te guste tanto escriba algo que te haga sentir así... Como todos los libros de celebridades, este libro fue una oportunidad desperdiciada, algo que pudo ser y no fue."
Besos entre líneas,Camila,"March 9, 2017",,"Dos cosas: no pienso puntuarlo, solo por el hecho que no quiero menospreciar algo que no he terminado y que, por mas malo que sea, creo que las escritoras les hace mucha ilusión haberlo publicado y me da pena desvalorar esto.
Segundo, odio hablar negativamente de un libro, si lo odio o me desagrada prefiero guardarmelo para mi, pero este me ha dado mas rabia que otra cosa por lo que tengo que descargarme.
Comencé a leer este libro por curiosidad, necesitaba ver porque lo criticaban tanto. No suelo odiar los libros con cliches o los que se parecen a fanficts (mientras esten bien escritos claro) de hecho a After le di 3 estrellitas porque en general me gusto. Pero con este...con este que se hace llamar libro si que no he podido ni seguir.
Lei unas 100 o 120 paginas(? Y no aguante mas.
Odio dejar un libro pero con el enserio que no he podido.
Ya desde el comienzo empezó mal.

Primer cosa odiosa: La primera vez que se encuentra con el que sera nuestro protagonista masculino no es solo idiota, sino también incoherente y completamente horrible desde cualquier lugar donde mires. Como en el infierno va a dejar que este (o cualquier persona) deje que le meta droga en su bolsillo y la bese para zafar de la policía. Desde ahí supe que la protagonista seria no tonta, lo siguiente.

Segunda cosa: El asunto de la hermana anorexica y lo mal que esta tratado ese tema.
Déjenme decirles algo escritoras, INFÓRMENSE, en tres meses no te curas si has estado tan grave de tal enfermedad. Me molesta que toquen un tema tan delicado sin realmente molestarse en buscar información sobre el. Ah y algo mas, si no saben del tema y quieren tocarlo porque ponerle drama a los libros agrega paginas que no sabían como rellenar, usen un poco la cabeza y sepan que no le puedes preguntar a alguien que salio de un trastorno alimenticio si ha adelgazado como le pregunto Emma (la prota) a su hermana.

Tercera cosa: LOS WPP. Son deplorables. Mis ojos sangraban y llegue al punto en el que ya ni intentaba descifrarlos. Hasta el código morse es mas fácil de comprender que estos.

Cuarta cosa: El prota masculino. Yo amo con toda mi alma a los chicos malos, incluso si son un cliche andante o medios capullos, pero este era un idiota a posta. No hizo falta mas que su primer aparición para que me caiga mal. Enserio lo odio.

Cuarta cosa: LA PROTAGONISTA. Ella es todo lo que esta mal en este libro, es una niña caprichosa, manipuladora, bipolar, egoísta, idiota y con cero neuronas. Podría decirles todo lo mal que hizo, desde que trata mal hasta a su perrita hasta que solo va a ver a su padre discapacitado para poder pasar tiempo con Erick. Pero seria una perdida de tiempo.

Súmenle también, que contiene mil contradicciones y una mala redacción...
No me imagino el resto del contenido si así comienza.

Miro a ambas booktubers y ambas me gustan (sobre todo Esme) y creo que eso es lo que me da mas rabia. Que, May, siendo tan defensora de las mujeres y criticando los libros por el machismo de los protagonistas o que las mujeres no se hacen respetar cree...esto."
Besos entre líneas,Cristina,"April 19, 2016",1.0,"No suelo hacer la reseña en Goodreads puesto que las hago en el blog, pero en este caso es necesario. Permitidme empezar la reseña con un GIF, creo que este define perfectamente cómo estaba cuando leía Besos entre líneas.



Besos entre líneas es el típico producto de la literatura juvenil entendida como producto lleno de tópicos para agradar al lector. Tenemos una prota friki porque lee y un chico malote e incomprendido. ¿Cómo puede acabar esto? (En la hoguera debería terminar).

Emma es una protagonista inmadura, desobediente, que se cree mejor que los demás por ser lectora y que no piensa en nadie más que no sea ella. En la sinopsis se nos dice que "" Entre los estudios y sus responsabilidades familiares, Emma no tiene mucho tiempo para hacer lo propio de su edad"". ESO ES MENTIRA. Emma es una adolescente normal y corriente: va al instituto, habla con sus amigas por whatsapp, se conecta a internet, lee, saca a pasear al perro y ayuda, de vez en cuando, a las tareas de casa. Los fines de semana, ""cuida"" a su padre discapacitado e incluso tiene tiempo de pensar en el amor. ¿Eso no es hacer lo propio de su edad? Quizá lo propio de su edad sería salir a emborracharse y enrollarse con cualquier jovencuelo que la soportara. Incluso su tía debe recalcar varias veces que Emma se pasa el día enganchada al ordenador, como hace cualquier otro adolescente:

""Escucho cómo llaman de nuevo a la puerta y mi tía se asoma.
—¡Emma!, ¿quieres ir de una vez a ayudar a tu padre? Hace veinte minutos que te dije que bajaras.
—Ya voy, tía, no me había dado cuenta de la hora.
Qué rabia tener que dejar lo que estoy haciendo. ¡Quiero seguir viendo vídeos!
—Cómo no, internet —dice mirando mi ordenador.
—¡Siempre estás igual! —le contesto molesta.
—¿Que yo siempre estoy igual? Deja un rato los libros y el blog, y baja a ayudar a tu padre.
—Voy.
Me levanto después de cerrar el portátil y salgo de mi habitación bajo la mirada enfurecida de Anne.
A veces odio tener tantas obligaciones familiares.""

Esta es la actitud de Emma durante todo el libro, menos en los momentos en los que lamenta tratar tan mal a su padre [Pero ojo, no a su tía, que la ha acogido en su casa, le da una educación, dinero para sus caprichos...Y un largo etcétera]. Hay veces en las que lamenta no ocuparse de su padre, para luego volver a pensar en blogger/booktube y en el maromo llamado Eric. No hace nada por cambiar, por ser más atenta con su padre, por dejar de lloriquear porque no le dejan libertad. Incluso va a verlo a la residencia solo porque sabe que ahí trabaja Eric. Si esto no es ser mala hija, no sé qué puede ser.

Emma solo tiene unas cuantas cosas en el cerebro y se reducen a ELLA-ELLA-ELLA. Porque ella es la mejor, ella no se equivoca nunca, ella es tan perfecta que incluso hizo que su hermana superara la anorexia y por eso debe estarle eternamente agradecida. Por no hablar de que ella es la más fan de los libros, que ella es superior por leer, que su afición de toquetear los libros en las librerías es perfecta [Es ASQUEROSO manosear un libro que no te vas a comprar] y que su habitación huele a libros [Literalmente. «¡Pero si el olor a libros es el que más me gusta del mundo mundial!». Los libros de por sí no huelen, eso es que los tienes comidos de mierda y polvo]. Por no hablar de que desprestigia [mentalmente, claro, porque no se atreve a decir nada] a quien no le gusta lo mismo que a ella.


En cuanto a Eric, el chico guapo y arrollador...No podía ser más inútil, más tópico, menos guapo. Porque cabe decir que cada vez que aparece este personaje, se nos remarca lo guapo que es.

""Descubro unos ojos azules tan oscuros como bonitos, custodiados por unas pestañas espesas. // Está tan guapo con esa camiseta azul oscura que se ajusta a su cuerpo… Por no hablar de que conjunta con sus ojos. ""

Este chaval es el tópico del malote con patas, malote que es malo porque tiene un oscuro pasado detrás. Eric consigue que Emma se enamore de él en menos que canta un gallo. Solo se han visto una vez y ella ya se conoce todos sus movimientos y su forma de hablar. Aunque él se comporte como un capullo la mayoría de veces, ella cae rendida a sus pies y no puede dejar de pensar en él, incluso después de saber su oscuro secreto, que la prota tiene bien en perdonar en el último capítulo porque, pobrecito, él no tuvo culpa de nada MINI SPOILER Sí la tuvo, mató a su pareja porque conducía borracho y no hace nada por dejar de conducir borracho, porque continúa conduciendo en ese estado. Y los padres de Emma tuvieron ese accidente fatal por culpa de un hombre borracho, por lo que ella más que nadie debería NO PERDONAR a Eric FIN MINI SPOILER Otra de las cosas que me molestaron de Eric es que él sabe lo que hizo mal pero tampoco hace nada por solucionarlo, sigue absolutamente igual. Mira, quizá por eso está con Emma, son tal para cual.

El resto de los personajes en el libro es mero relleno. En serio, relleno total. A continuación os dejo cómo se describe a una de las mejores amigas de Emma:

""[...] pues es una chica muy risueña. Sandra es la más alta de las tres, tiene el pelo rubio y un mechón azul.""

Y ya está. No conocemos nada más. Todo muy normal y correcto; para eso mejor no introduces al personaje.


No hay profundidad en la trama, no hay profundidad en los personajes, no hay profunidad en la historia de amor. Es un 0 patatero en todo. Apenas tenemos descripción de los lugares, de los sentimientos de los protagonistas, de la vida en general. El pueblo parece tener la grandaria de una ciudad, puesto que cuenta con varias librerías, un videoclub, una gran biblioteca...Biblioteca a la que la protagonista siempre va pero nunca utiliza el servicio de préstamo de libros [Para eso están las editoriales, que con menos de 200 seguidores ya le van detrás para enviarle libros].

Un tema que también debe ser mencionado es el LENGUAJE totalmente inventado con el que se comunica una de las amigas de la protagonista, Esther. Básicamente parece que aporrea el teclado con la cabeza, en vez de usar los dedos. Os pongo un ejemplo:

«Magfdita! Ujng tio no pugdejde serf goapo y norlsmal. No! Tine queser un cambello».

Personalmente no me gustan los Whatsapps en los libros, pero entiendo que es el modo de comunicarse entre los jóvenes y que deben aparecer...¿Pero así? Eso no es ser realista, ser realista sería comerse alguna vocal, usar el ""q"" para decir ""que"" pero... ¿ norlsmal?. Por no decir que la protagonista es la ÚNICA que escribe ortográficamente bien en el libro, porque claro, ella es la más perfecta del mundo. Eso no se lo cree nadie.

En el libro se dan ciertas lecturas que podrían ser muy perjudiciales para los jóvenes. (Como que si un chico te molesta es porque te quiere; si un chico es guapo, le debes permitir que te toque todo lo que quiera aunque no lo conozcas de nada, a tu pareja le debes perdonar todo porque pobrecito...)

Por otro lado, el libro parece más un folleto publicitario de otras obras literarias que un libro en sí. He hecho un documento en el que pongo todas las referencias literarias y tiene más de 50, sin contar las repeticiones; además, cuando se menciona un libro se hace una referencia al mismo:

""Voy a intentar empezar La lección de August, me lo regaló mi hermana hace dos navidades y todavía no lo he leído. Dicen que va sobre el acoso escolar y que está cargado de valores...""

Por no hablar de las referencias veladas a editoriales ""la editorial que está publicando los nuevos libros de Armentrout"" (Plataforma Neo, evidentemente) y referencias totalmente directas a autores amigos de las autoras ""me firmó su última novela, Algo tan sencillo como tuitear te quiero. Blue tiene una pluma diferente y una capacidad increíble para crear personajes y personajes. Y encima él es encantador.""

Y, para rizar el rizo, referencias a otros blogueros/booktubers amigos de las autoras:

""¿Conoces a La? Del canal Las frases de La."" (Y yo pienso ""¿Conoces a Fa? Del canal Las palabras de Fa"") // "" Sobretodo veo vídeos de Bastian, el español con más seguidores en su canal: El coleccionista de universos. "" ¿Conocéis a SeBASTIÁN, de El coleccionista de mundos? // «También me gustan mucho los vídeos de los mexicanos Lau, de Lau Reads Books», oh, qué casualidad que hay un canal booktubue que se llama ""Clau Reads Books"".

¿Estoy leyendo un libro o estoy leyendo SPAM?

En cuanto al tema de blogger, la protagonista vive en el mundo de Yupi. Su blog tiene 200 seguidores y las editoriales ya le envían libros. Pero de repente tiene más de 1000 seguidores, sin indicarnos cuánto tiempo ha pasado y qué ha hecho para conseguirlo porque no parece que lea/escriba mucho, teniendo en cuenta lo ocupada que está con su padre [ironía]. Lo peor es cuando se hace booktuber, porque entonces tenemos unas cuantas páginas que deberían titularse BOOKTUBE PARA DUMMIES, páginas totalmente innecesarias y molestas, en las que la protagonista descubre lo que pasa cuando decides no cargar la cámara con la que te estás grabando. Por otro lado, la protagonista sube un solo vídeo y al cabo de unas horas ya tiene más de 150 seguidores en ese canal, e incluso el booktuber más famoso de Méjico la ve. MINI SPOILER Booktuber con el que la protagonista tendrá un affaire, totalmente INNECESARIO. Dejaos de triángulos amorosos que son más falsos que una moneda de Popeye FIN MINI SPOILER.

Pero lo peor de booktube viene cuando la protagonista y sus amigas van a la BLOGGER LIT CON, entonces sí que tenemos referencias literarias por un tubo, así como escenas totalmente patéticas en las que la prota se topa con su booktuber preferido [El de Méjico] y él la reconoce así porque sí [recordemos que su canal tiene ahora solo dos videos y un montón de seguidores]; o cuando le da una rabieta cuando le llaman para que vuelva a casa porque su padre ha tenido un infarto.

EXASPERANTE, ESTÚPIDO E ILÓGICO. Así definiría el libro si solo pudiera usar tres adjetivos."

///

Hoy he recordado que mi yo del pasado perdió su tiempo leyendo este libro y me he dicho, voy a publicar mi reseña aquí por si alguien quiere leer un rato. Es la misma del link de arriba, pero bue ahí va:


Como todos y todas sabréis, es la novela publicada por Esmeralda Verdú y Mar R. Ayamonte, ambas booktubers conocidas en España. El libro empezó con muy malas críticas. No me llamaba especialmente la atención, aunque este último año he leído más romance que nunca (de hecho, hasta escribo uno como pasatiempo), pero era una lectura como otra cualquiera para pasar el rato. El caso es, volviendo a las críticas, que no ha tenido muy buena acogida. Leí algunas reseñas muy completas (con extractos y argumentos, y no un simple: me ha gustado/no me ha gustado) y quedé alucinada. Después decidí echar un vistazo a GoodReads, donde la grandísima mayoría hablaba pestes del libro (y de vez en cuando te encontrabas con una reseña buena que daba la casualidad que era de un booktuber conocido, ¡anda!). Así que aquí me encuentro ahora, pensando cómo plasmar todo lo que he pensado durante la lectura, y después de ella. He reflexionado mucho y no, no voy a darle una buena puntuación, pero porque no me ha gustado PERSONALMENTE y en términos generales. Os adelanto que va a ser una reseña larga, la más larga que he escrito, así que vayamos por partes.

El argumento de la historia es bastante sencillo, nada que se salga de lo común o que digas ¡oh, qué original! En fin, ¿qué más da esto? Pues nada, no importa en absoluto, la finalidad es entretener así que el argumento es tan bueno como cualquier otro. ¿Por qué no me ha gustado (A MÍ)? Porque . Además, me he pasado casi toda la novela enfadada con Emma y eso es algo que no me gusta nada cuando leo. No obstante, Emma no es la primera niña repelente, infantil e inmadura que me encuentro protagonizando una historia, pero . Baila al son de Eric (el protagonista híper-súper-ultra-mega guapo y malote pero de chocolate fundido por dentro) y creo que no hace falta decir que eso es algo que dista muchísimo de ser un referente (sobre todo cuando se habla de feminismo). Por su parte, Eric es el chico malo pero tremendamente sexy de la historia. Y diréis, ¡qué típico! Pues sí, así que siendo ésto tan normal en este tipo de historias, OBVIAMENTE tenía que haber drama para darle juguillo al asunto. ¿Cuál es el drama? SPOILER: Eric tuvo un accidente gravísimo de moto por el que le condenaron a trabajos comunitarios, además de tener una madre enferma de cáncer FIN SPOILER. . No obstante, resulta bastante predecible, aunque, oye, cada cual con sus gustos.

Por otro lado, más personajes influyentes en la historia serían las amigas de la protagonista, , que al parecer leen muchísimo pero no tienen ni puta idea de escribir, si se me permite la expresión. Lo siento, pero me parece completamente absurdo que Emma (y, posteriormente, Eric y Gabriel) sea la única con el poder supremo de controlar la ortografía. ""Absurdo"" es una palabra que leeréis mucho hoy, pues la novela está llena de incoherencias y absurdeces (¿hay diferencia? La hay). . Chicas, algo es habitual cuando sucede con frecuencia y casual cuando no lo hace. ¡AMBAS COSAS ES UN SINSENTIDO! . Por esta regla de tres, estoy viviendo una mentira (yo, y medio mundo). ¡CÓMO SE OS OCURRE RELACIONAR LA ORIENTACIÓN SEXUAL CON LOS GUSTOS LITERARIOS! ¡CÓMO SE OS OCURRE DECIR QUE ""YA DECÍA YO QUE LE GUSTABAN MÁS LAS PROTAGONISTAS...""! ¡POR FAVOR, QUE TENEMOS YA DOS DEDOS DE FRENTE PARA SOLTAR ESTE TIPO DE ESTUPIDECES! Otras incoherencias son: (¿Pequeño y pedacito en la misma frase?). Entiendo la expresión (algo pequeño que significa mucho para ti), pero cuando te refieres a un trozo de algo lo llamas pedazo (un pedazo de tarta), de forma que podrías decir ""pequeño gran pedazo"" (para construir la expresión que quieres) y no meter un diminutivo y un adjetivo que signifiquen lo mismo en una misma frase, porque es un error de expresión. Cuando lo leí me acordé de mi hermano cuando era pequeño y nos pedía un bocadillo de eso rosa. Se refería a la mortadela y todos lo entendíamos, pero lo que decía no tenía ningún sentido. Y solo una más: . ¿Llevas toda tu vida escondiéndote o lo haces desde que ocurrió el accidente? Nuevamente, sabemos lo que quieren decir, pero está mal expresado. No tiene sentido que digas que llevas toda la vida haciendo algo para referirte, entiendo yo, a que lo llevas haciendo desde muy pequeña si después vas a matizar que es desde el accidente, cargándote así toda la oración. Lo único que consiguen es que la lectura, por muy corta y simple que sea, se haga pesada. Y ya es decir.

Más personajes, más personajes... ¡La familia de Emma! En un primer momento nos encontramos con Anne y David (tía y novio de la tía), que hacen el papel de padres (nada que objetar a eso), pero también aparece su hermana Lys (y su irrelevante novio Javi) que sufrió anorexia después del accidente de sus padres y que debuta en la novela con el siguiente diálogo:






Muy normal, sí señor, que le preguntes eso a tu hermana. ¡Claro que sí! Lo que más me crispa de todo esto es que y, atención al dato, ¡se lo perdona porque oh, virgencita de Guadalupe, qué ojazos tiene el mozo! En fin, tonterías como esta a parte (que hay unas cuantas), la idea general de la novela me parece buena para entretener (para el público al que está dirigido, lo es), pero sin más.

Y diréis: ya no habrá más personajes. ¡Pues los hay! Y no es que sean relevantes para la historia (puede que Gabriel, el booktuber, lo sea, pero sería la única excepción y no me voy a parar a hablar de él y de su pobre personalidad de arroz con habichuelas), es que , cosa que resulta innecesaria y que carga la narración (y no me voy a poner a mencionarlos todos, como comprenderéis). ¡Y hablando de cosas que cargan la narración! (pasando por alto repeticiones de las mismas o aquellas que me parecía que encajaban bien en el contexto, de modo que realmente serían algunas más). Supongo que esto lo habrá dicho todo el mundo, pero en fin: a todos y todas nos gustan las referencias, nos gusta estar leyendo y que aparezca algún título o personaje conocido, pero este caso es una exageración. El primer tercio de la novela empieza a hacerse pesado precisamente por eso. Pero dejemos de lado el número de referencias y centrémonos en la forma de citarlas. . Os pongo un ejemplo: . ¡¡¿QUÉ?!! ¿Qué adolescente (o persona dentro de cualquier franja de edad) piensa eso cuando va a coger o leer algún libro? ¡Emma, claro! No tiene sentido que cada vez que hables de un libro cites tanto el título como el autor porque queda MUY forzado. Es algo que sobrecarga la narración, que no atrae a seguir leyendo y que CANSA (MUCHO). Me parece genial que vayas a la firma de Maggie Stiefvater, pero puedes decir que te llevas todos sus libros y no citar CADA TÍTULO, que no son pocos. Al fin y al cabo, dices lo mismo pero de una forma mucho más atractiva que no cansa al lector (de verdad, encontrarse cinco o seis referencias en un mismo párrafo es una barbaridad). Algunas veces durante la lectura no sabía si leía un anuncio, un correo electrónico de la Casa del Libro o la historia de una adolescente.

Y en cuanto a las repeticiones se refiere, ¡Existen formas de sustituir palabras para evitar una lectura repetitiva y cansina! En una historia así es inevitable repetir muchas veces los nombres de los protagonistas pero EXISTE ""ÉL"", ""SU"", ""SUYO"", ""VUESTRO"", ""ELLOS"", ""ELLAS"", ¿alargo la lista? Y lo mismo para el resto de la novela. En varias ocasiones se repiten palabras que fácilmente podrían sustituirse por sinónimos, muy comunes además. Destacaré un caso en concreto (porque bastante largo se está haciendo esto ya): en una ocasión, Eric y Emma se encuentran en el supermercado. Aquí, el chico tiene que revisar un coche que no arranca. ¡Y SE LLEGA A DECIR LA PALABRA ""COCHE"" HASTA SEIS VECES EN POCAS LÍNEAS! Eric rodea el coche, arranca el coche, ¡ale he arreglado el coche!, sube al coche, subo yo también al coche. Creo que cualquiera que revisara el libro antes de publicarlo vería este tipo de cosas (vamos, yo soy la primera que no publica nada sin haberlo revisado varias veces antes). ¡CÓMO PUEDE SER QUE HAYA TANTOS ERRORES SEÑORES DE PLANETA! Porque una cosa es que escribas un libro, que puedes hacerlo mejor o peor, pero otra muy diferente es que lo presentes a una editorial QUE SE SUPONE QUE REVISA EL MANUSCRITO y que no corrija estas cosas.

El odio que se están llevando las autoras es impresionante y no lo justificaré (y no me voy a meter en temas que no sea la novela en sí) pero ¡QUÉ ESTÁ HACIENDO LA EDITORIAL PLANETA! Aquí falta mucho trabajo de edición. Vamos, cuando lees este libro parece que estés con una novela autopublicada (que he leído y estaba mejor escrita). Incluso he leído cosas en Wattpad con mejor expresión que este libro. Y no, no me meto con las autoras por esto, me meto con la editorial. ¿ALGUIEN TRABAJA EN ESE SITIO? Por favor, un poquito de decoro, que el libro vale casi dieciséis euros y tienen más trabajo algunas reseñas que la edición del mismo. Eso sí, señores de planeta, la portada es muy bonita.

Siguiendo con errores de expresión y ortográficos, hay comas fuera de sitio y otras que deberían estar pero faltan. Además, hay frases muy cortas y otras ridículamente largas. Quiero decir, (sobre todo en una novela escrita a cuatro manos, que se note TANTO el cambio de una autora a otra lo hace todo muy raro de leer porque le quita agilidad y continuidad). Esto, dentro de lo que cabe, es lo de menos, pero tenía que decirlo. Las subordinadas dan mucha profundidad a un relato, pero solo si sabes usarlas. Y las frases cortas pueden ser geniales, pero mételas donde toca. Con esto, algunas veces faltaban comas pero otras sobraban puntos. También cabe añadir que . Cargar un libro de descripciones puede resultar pesado y hacer la lectura aburrida, pero algunas cosas hay que explicarlas para que el lector las vea. Por ejemplo, y esto es a nivel personal (como todo, en realidad), creo que habría estado bien describir al padre de Emma al principio. Bañan al señor no sé ni las veces a lo largo de la historia y, obviamente, siempre es una tarea difícil por su inmovilidad e incapacidad. Pero, mágicamente, alrededor de la página 80 (o así) resultaba difícil porque tiene sobrepeso. ¡A BUENAS HORAS ME LO CUENTAS!

Y dicho todo esto, voy a la historia en sí, a la que la chica nos cuenta independientemente de los errores que podamos encontrar. La idea es buena, acorde a la edad del público al que se dirige. No es nada novedoso, pero no está mal, como he dicho desde un principio. Creo que la finalidad de todo libro, sobre todo de temática juvenil, es entretener al lector. Es muy cierto que la mayoría (dentro de esa franja de edad) extrapola e idealiza la historia, pero es tarea de los autores y autoras dejar claro que ES FICCIÓN (vamos, que no seáis Emma). (Marvilloso Desastre, After, 50 Sombras, Mírame y dispara...).

Emma es una adolescente (NO NORMAL) que se enamora. ¿Hasta ahí todo bien? Sí, bueno. Completemos la frase: Emma es una adolescente con grandes obligaciones familiares, como cuidar a su padre deficiente, que adora leer, que es pura, casta y virgen (porque parece que las chicas en las novelas románticas juveniles tienen que ser así, cosa que no puede darme más asco) y que se enamora del malote idiota. Hablaría de la tontería que me parece que la protagonista crea que su gran y guapo enamorado es un mujeriego porque besa a tres chicas durante el libro, pero el sarcasmo sería ya demasiado. El comportamiento de Emma me ponía de los nervios. Cosas como que desatienda a su padre o le cabree ir a ayudarlo porque ¡oh, maldita vida que me ha tocado vivir, qué he hecho yo para merecer esto! QUIERE TENER ALGO DE TIEMPO PARA PENSAR EN ERIC Y ABRIRSE UN CANAL DE YOUTUBE. Niña, tu padre está mal, está teniendo un ataque de nervios, de ansiedad, o de lo que sea. ¡Un poquito de por favor! . Que se diga que Emma es un ejemplo a seguir para las jóvenes, que es un personaje feminista, y demás cosas como éstas, me parece lo más absurdo que he oído/leído en mi vida. Una chica que define la orientación sexual de su amiga por sus gustos literarios, que acepta que un desconocido le haya metido droga en la ropa porque es guapo... ¿Es un modelo a seguir? Y otra cosa más. En dos ocasiones, con los dos únicos chicos que se relaciona Emma, aparece un mismo hecho. En ambas ocasiones, la chica tiene que volver a casa (o es de noche, o está lejos, lo que sea) y el chico (los dos lo hacen por igual) se empeña en acompañarla (PORQUE CLARO ES PELIGROSO QUE VAYAS TÚ SOLA SIN MÍ POR AHÍ PARA PROTEGERTE O PARA QUE NO TE PIERDAS O PARA QUE TENGAS COMPAÑÍA O LA CHORRADA QUE QUIERAS AÑADIR EN ESTE PARÉNTESIS). No me digas que esto es feminismo, porque no lo es. Chicas, EL PATERNALISMO NO ES FEMINISMO. No me extiendo más en esto, que aún me quedan un par de cositas por comentar.

El final, sorprendentemente, me ha gustado un poco. Me ha gustado la forma de tratar la relación al final y concluir el libro, aunque tengo que decir que eso de que vuelvan a encontrarse por casualidad me ha acabado de rematar. Se encuentran por casualidad en la biblioteca, en el súper, en el instituto (o sea, misma clase), de fiesta, en áreas específicas del hospital... ¡Qué agonía! Y no habléis de cosas del destino, que no acabamos. El libro estaría bien si se le diera un buen repaso, porque se nota muchísimo el cambio de un capítulo a otro. Cuando hacemos un trabajo grupal en la universidad, una persona del grupo se encarga de leerlo y poner en sincronía las partes. Aquí se nota muchísimo el cambio de uno a otro, la forma de expresar las cosas. La narración es diferente, los diálogos son diferentes (aunque igual de innecesarios en muchas ocasiones)... No parece que sea la misma persona la que cuenta la historia. Creo que, en el caso de haber sido desde el punto de vista de ambos protagonistas (por poner un ejemplo), se hubiese notado menos. Quiero decir, cada uno tendría su forma de contar la historia. De esta forma queda muy pobre y choca bastante a la hora de leerlo.

¡Qué más puedo decir! Creo que ya está bien. ¿Podría seguir? Podría, pero no me apetece. Creo que ha quedado bastante claro, si es que lo habéis leído todo. Podría añadir citas incoherentes, ejemplos de diálogos absurdos, aportaciones innecesarias... Pero creo que se ha entendido el mensaje. Iba a poner alguna imagen, por eso de amenizar la lectura de la reseña, pero ya para qué, ¿no creéis? Solo añadiré que creo que no es un problema que se publiquen libros de you(book)tubers, éxitos de Wattpad y demás. Estoy segura de que cualquiera en su lugar aprovecharía para publicar. Si te gusta escribir y tienes la oportunidad, ¿la vas a dejar pasar? No, claro que no. El problema, pues, no es que publiquen a las booktubers sino que lo hagan a ciegas.

A escribir se aprende escribiendo, así que menos odio y más análisis."
Besos entre líneas,Lu Weasley ⚡️,"July 1, 2016",1.0,"0'5 de 5 y porque se salva el epílogo que es lo único que me ha gustado del libro.
Me quería leer este libro desde que supe que iba a salir porque soy seguidora de las autoras en YouTube, luego vi las críticas que estaba recibiendo y me entró curiosidad por saber si de verdad era tan malo como el 90% de la gente decía por aquí. Y sin duda si, lo es.
He tenido todo el rato la sensación de estar leyendo una fanfic escrita por una persona (o dos) totalmente inmadura y que escribe más por diversión que por saber hacerlo.
También me parece fatal como tratan un tema tan delicado como la discapacidad con frases como ""Ojalá solo estuviera discapacitado físicamente"" o ""te quejaras vives de lujo"" porque le lleva a su padre el desayuno a la cama o cómo tratan la anorexia con tanto cliché y de manera tan bruta véase el ya famoso ""¿Has adelgazado?"" de Emma a su hermana según la ve llegar.
Emma me parece un personaje egoísta, que solo se preocupa por sí mismo, que no ve más allá de su culo y que encima se queja de tener que cuidar a su padre al cual supuestamente adora aunque con su comportamiento infantil demuestra lo contrario.
Me ha disgustado como May especialmente cataloga el ""instalove"" y los triángulos amorosos en sus vídeos de algo que no le gusta y que le parece muy usado en la literatura y en la 3º página del libro Emma y Eric ya se aman profundamente a pesar de lo incomprensible y surrealista de la situación inicial entre los dos al igual que pasa con Gabriel nada más encontrarse a Emma ya la ama (casualidad que ella ya no estaba con Eric aunque ni sí quiera recuerdo cuando se supone que empezaron porque él se iba liando con toda mujer viviente) es un libro que engloba todo aquello que a May le parece una mierda de la literatura y eso me parece muy hipócrita por su parte. Tanto hacer apología del feminismo y luego escriben este libro y ¿se quedan tan anchas?, me parece insultante.
Sinceramente se nota que Planeta ha decidido publicar este libro por quien lo ha escrito y no por cómo está escrito.
En fin me lo he terminado porque quería opinar habiéndolo leído y aquí está mi opinión.
Este libro es una perdida de tiempo y de dinero (que encima vale 15€ el libro)"
Birth Control is Sinful in the Christian Marriages and also Robbing God of Priesthood Children!!,Vanessa,"April 26, 2012",5.0,"I've never done this before but I'm going to give this five stars despite never having read nor purchased this for a few obvious reasons.

1.) The cover is freaking awesome. Why pay good money to some liberal elite photographer or graphic artist to design a cover when you have an Olan Mills studio right in your hometown?

2.) The title needs a spoiler warning.

3.) The author hearts exclamation marks but hates apostrophe's!!

4.) May or may not be written ENTIRELY IN CAPS.

5.) I'm not sure but since the title specifies ""Christian Marriage"", I am assuming this was written for the overlooked Christian polyamory market.

6.) The clown car joke will get old never.

7.) As we know from the recent media brouhaha, girls who want to use birth control are also dirty, dirty sloots.

8.) This book will set you back motherfucking $150.00.

(Please tell me this thing isn't for real. I mean, even if it is, please tell me it's a joke.)"
Birth Control is Sinful in the Christian Marriages and also Robbing God of Priesthood Children!!,Petra practice made me perfect at effing things up,"March 26, 2023",5.0,"WHOREDOM PROSPERITY JOBS

Jesus wept. I mean that both in the common usage sense, of an expletive and that this book, more or less dedicated to him, would have made him weep that this is how his message is interpreted.

That said, the author is very amusing once you get past the 1000+ pages of CAPS, the peculiar use of > * and < as punctuation and the endless repetition.

The author hates, more than anything, skinny women, and praises the full-figure motherly shape continually. She thinks homosexuality is a sin, but is not homophobic. She thinks it is caused by women feeding their men soup and crackers. Actually she has quite a thing for soup and crackers. Gets you thin though and might get you a Whoredom Prosperity Job.

Ms Eliyzabeth, as she refers to herself, thinks that women's wombs have been created to have a baby every 12 months, and that 7-10 babies per 15 years of marriage is a good number to aim for. (At this point I should say that my late mother-in-law had 10 in less than that. But good Christian as she was, she was also a feminist. She just liked babies a lot and West Indians had big families back then.)

My final thought (because amusing as this is, I can't take it any more) is that even if I was a Christian I would have to be a sinner when she puts the choice like this:

*TODAYS WOMANS HAVE KILLED>OR STOP >THE CHILD BEARING YEARS: WITH BIRTH CONTROL . ON PURPOSE!! ****EVEN WAITING UNTIL OLDER YEARS OF 40S AND FIFTY: BEFORE THEY HAVE THEIR FIRST CHILD: REAPING THE LABEL OF SINFUL WOMEN: JUST TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE FREEDOM OF SEXUAL DESIRES AND MONEY AND WEALTH. ***EVEN ENJOY SEXUAL POPULARITY IN THE WHOREDOM WORLD FOR TELEVISION FAME AND WEALTH. **

This is a 5 star book for amusement value. I would have so liked to hear her preach on (the whoredom world) of TV. So I could turn it off.

It seems people think that I am really something for actually having read this book so I thought I would put the record straight. I didn't it. What I did was look up phrases. I looked up things like lust, pornography, suffer, eggs, pain, gay, teenage and masturbation. The last didn't produce any results. It's probably there but misspelt.
So no, I didn't read it, just looked up the buzz words :-)"

Birth Control is Sinful in the Christian Marriages and also Robbing God of Priesthood Children!!,John,"July 21, 2012",1.0,"Ms. Strong-Anderson, please turn your Caps Lock key OFF!

Some time ago, a witty colleague asked me if I had seen author Ms. Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson's epic 648-page ""masterpiece"" Birth Control is Sinful in the Christian Marriages and also Robbing God of Priesthood Children!!, and I had to reply that I had not. I was told by my friend where to look, so I did, and I read some of the reviews. But at the price asked by the author, all I could do was shake my head, as it seemed to be quite a price for such a monograph.

A few months ago I was perusing some of the Amazon tags and noticed within the 'amazon oddities' category, this book was one of the top ranking there. And while searching further I discovered that this tome was listed as a Kindle edition at a far more reasonable price. One can in fact purchase this Kindle version, , for less than a pound of decent coffee (at the time of this writing), and one will need plenty of that to try and work your way through the listed 1218 pages.

Curiosity got the better of me, and on a whim I bought it when is was on Amazon.com in mid-January at $3.03, just over three bucks, so I bit the bullet and purchased it. At that price, why not?



But how does one explain such a book, much less review it?

Perhaps the best way is to reproduce the highlights and notes that I was taking with the Kindle while I was reading it, starting in January 2012. I've deleted some of them, as they reflected some confusion that I was going through as I read this manuscript, but I have not corrected the spelling, grammar, the syntax or the excessive use of upper case words and letters. To make this somewhat legible within the framework of Amazon reviews, from my saved Kindle highlights, my comments will be listed here with a • Note annotation.

At this point I have to note that about a third of the way through this headache-inducing manifesto, with all of its misspellings, overuse of the Caps Lock key and appalling grammar, with all of the ""YOUTH LUST"", ""FORNACATION"", ""FLESHLY PARTS"", ""OUTER PARTS"", and such, I had been wondering where Ms. Strong-Anderson. That was to be answered at Kindle location 18421, where the author states:

This Kindle title is noted as being ""Text-to-Speech Enabled"" in the product description. I've used this feature upon occasion with my Kindle 2 when my eyes were tired, or a few times out of pure curiosity. The feature usually works well once the user learns how and when to use the controls, but I might suggest that it not be tried on your Kindle. A number of pages in, my Kindle started acting up, and I thought that it was speaking in tongues... . I did a Kindle reset, and all was fine, so I tried the text-to-speech option successfully on a number of other titles. But when I tried it again on Ms. Strong-Anderson's e-book again, the Kindle became locked up once again, and had to be reset. I didn't try it again, but use caution if you try it. Your experience may vary.




It's hard to explain my reactions to this often rambling dissertation, as I often had to put it down. Curiosity made me take a large section of this author's tract and do a grammar check on it, and it ended up with a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 5.1. This was actually surprising considering the massive amount of grammar and typographic errors.

It was published by AuthorHouse in 2008, and this company is known as a ""self-publishing"" business, one of those where you pay your money to have your book published. I can only guess that Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson didn't buy their proofing package or that the editors there have even lower grammar skills than does Ms. Strong-Anderson. And I want to tread lightly here as the author profile on her paper copy of this book states that she has ""A 1ST DEGREE BLACK BELT IN TAEJUKENPO KARATE."" I never heard of before and cannot find any 'Net references to it other than those referring to anyone other than this author.

The overuse of uppercase and the frequent typographic errors gave me a headache while reading it, yet at times I found Ms. Strong-Anderson's treatise to be absolutely hilarious. And I often wonder about authors who seem to have a frequent focus on body parts to the point that it seems obsessive.

Some parts of this are yawningly boring beyond description. I had thought Dan Brown's had been difficult to get through at over 600 pages in paperback, even with a lot of coffee, but this one is far worse. Dan Brown's book had at least some form of a plot; , unless I've been blinded by upper case letters.

You could also opt for the 600 page [[ASIN:0833030477 A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates]] from Rand Corporation, a reprint of their classic 1955 book consisting primarily of a random number table generated by an electronic simulation of a roulette wheel attached to a computer. For some readers, this may be more exciting and make more sense.

So in conclusion, how would I subjectively rate Ms. Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson's work here?

If it was a Kindle freebie, it charitably would be a 3-star offering, if only in recognition of the amount of work that the author put into this farce, for that's all that it could be. At $3.00 or thereabout, it's a 2-star travesty.

I don't recommend it unless you've exhausted everything possible that there is to read. Even comic books, including those which are written completely in upper case, are more entertaining. I've never before read anything like this in my life, but my curiosity was fed... and I almost choked on it.

Did you ever feel like there were wasted hours taken from your life that you could never again regain? But if she releases an e-book on Taejukenpo Karate, then I'll have to buy it, as that would have to be a real gem.



Since my original review was posted here on 4/26/2012, the author has evidently chosen to remove her bargain-priced e-book from the Amazon site. Those who wish to purchase this tome will have to buy the 648 page paperback version (published by AuthorHouse in 2008) , where the current price is $132.69 as of this date.

My original Amazon review still exists, but only if accessed directly , since Ms. Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson's Kindle edition no longer exists.

If you're an English teacher who owns a Kindle and wants to borrow my (now rare) Kindle edition for educational purposes and for a period of two weeks, please leave me a note or comment here. This book is a perfect example of what to do with spelling, grammar, and expository ideas, as it contains just about that can be made with the English language."

I am doing something I absolutely never do with this book: I am writing the review as I go along, because there are so many precious quotes that I want to use here I'll go through an entire notebook if I wait until I'm finished to kick this off. As I write these opening words, I'm only about thirty pages into this monstrosity, but there's absolutely no chance it's going to get any better, so why not start now?

If you at all follow the foibles of the vanity-publishing world, you are probably aware of Eliyzabeth [sic] Yanne Strong-Anderson's infamous tome . After being published, with an original list price of $150, it went viral almost immediately, with cascades of awful reviews, mentions on blook blogs, and the like. I knew I would eventually have to read this jewel. I even attempted to crowdsource the $150 ($135 with Amazon's generous discount) last year so I could pick a copy up. (For the record, I got $85 in pledges.) I eventually resigned myself to the fact that I'd be using well over half the Amazon gift certificate I get from my parents every year to shell out for a copy of this... and then it found its way into the world of ebooks. Halle-freakin'-lujah. And not only that, but not for the piddling 5%, or even half off, one normally sees in an ebook release. No, you could suddenly buy this previously out-of-reach $150 gem for the princely sum of . Needless to say, I plunked my money down that very day. (It has since gone down; as I write this in February 2012, the current ebook price is $3.03.) Which leads to the first thing I have to say about this particular ball of crazy: most of the reviews you will read of this stem from first reactions, reading the title and book description, or occasionally from those who have gone through a free preview at Amazon or Google Books. The review you are reading right now comes from someone who has attempted to read . All 648 pages of extreme nutterdom.

Now, to correct a couple of common misconceptions about this book, and to set a few guidelines:
1. AuthorHouse is a vanity publisher. What this means is that you send them a manuscript and a hefty chunk of change, and they publish it. Period. There is no editorial process with a vanity publisher (though some do offer the service for an extra hefty fee); it is entirely possible that no one but Ms. Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson set eyes on this manuscript before it was published. There is no slush pile. Nothing gets rejected unless (for some publishers, not all) it offends the common decency (for example, some vanity publishers would reject Nazi literature out of hand). In other words, no matter what the quality of the work you submit, you will get it published. “Publication” and “quality” can no longer be equated (if they ever could; vanity pubs have been around as long as publishers have).
2. it's not just the title and the product description that are rendered in all caps. In fact, with the exception of some Biblical quotes (which seem to be pulled from the biblestory website [note: link removed for Amazon consumption]), the entire book is written not only in all caps, but with a fascinating series of extraneous punctuation marks that, at present, make absolutely no sense to me. In fact, much of the reason I decided to write this review in diary form is because I'm going to attempt to crack Ms. Strong-Anderson's punctuation use and make sense of it.
As to the guidelines, they have to do with personal baggage I bring to the table. I am a media critic, and I am reading the book from the perspective of someone who prizes grammar, spelling, sentence structure, etc. over content. (Yes, I know I'm being a hypocrite given how badly I proofread my own reviews.) I am not a Christian. I also fundamentally disagree with the book's premise, though I must admit that as a champion [in the sense of “I fervently support and evangelize this” rather than in the sense of “I take up sword and shield to strike down its enemies”] of the Negative Population Growth movement, I must admit that one of Strong-Anderson's Biblical quotes led me to the idea that it's possible to Bibilically justify ZPG or NPG (God tells Adam and Eve to “be fruitful and multiply, ...”, which is pretty darned hard when the earth is currently supporting at least seven times the number of people that can sustainably exist on it). But that's another review entirely.

One more guideline: all quotes pulled directly from the book are [sic]. It would defeat the purpose to correct spelling, grammar, etc.

Might as well begin at the beginning, right? The very first sentence of the book sets the tone as well as anything:

“YES: GOD KNOWS YOU HEART AND GOD KNOWS YOUR INTENTIONS: BUT>>: THE VERY ACT AND THOUGHT OF BIRTH CONTROLING> IN A CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE: HAS ROBB GOD AND THE CHURCH OF MANY PRIESTHOOD CHILDREN: **CHILDREN RAISED IN THE LOVE OF JESUS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TRUTH AND A KEY TO FUTURE AND PROSPERITY OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HEAVEN. **”

Honestly, I probably stop right there and be done with this review, because the very first sentence of the book typifies everything I have found to be true of the rest of the manuscript so far. Strong-Anderson comes off here as barely literate. Tense and/or number agreement between subject and verb do not exist in Strong-Anderson's world except by coincidence. What you may at first consider typos turn out to be actual misspellings (e.g., “ROBB” is consistent throughout the ms. when she means “rob”). The punctuation is unfathomable. The run-on sentence is one of the four basic food groups. The language, as a result of all of the above combined with a severe grammatical awkwardness and the simple difficulty of reading all-caps text, is just this side of unintelligible; it's like reading if the narrator had been a religious zealot who shouted all the time. All of these things are enough for me to stop actually reviewing the book here. You know it's one of the most horrifying texts that will ever cross in front of your eyes, were you to attempt to actually read it. It's one of the most horrifying ever to cross , and I seek this sort of thing out like some people go trolling for crack rock. And yet...this is absolute comedy gold. It's the sort of thing I can see being group-read at cons in the way is now. Well, it's comedy gold as long as you don't take this raving seriously. For Strong-Anderson not only sees takers of birth control as murderers of countless children, she wants to make sure—like so many religious zealots do—that the earth is populated by so many people who believe like she does that they will be able to crush the rest of the religions (including the “BUDDISH AND HINDU”... do Buddish people only eat flowers or something?) out by sheer force of numbers alone:

“HOW MANY ANOINTED PREACHERS OR WOMEN TEACHING THE WORD OF GOD: DO YOU SEE HAVING YEARLY BABIES: UNDER THEIR PREACHING ANOINTING?? **ARE THEY TRUE TO THE ANOINTING OF GOD: OR ARE THEY LOOKING MORE LIKE THE FALSE CHRIST: THE HOLY WORD WARNS US ABOUT??”

In other words, to be a true Bible-believing Christian in the eyes of Strong-Anderson (who, she tells us a number of times, is a pastor who has a show on her local “public television” station [one assumes she means public access: please, for the love of all that's holy, someone tape excerpts and upload them to youtube!]), you must not only not take birth control, but if you're a woman, you have two states of existence: “pregnant” and “giving birth.” (At one point Strong-Anderson specifically equates women “*SEEKING JOBS:” with “[going] THE WAY OF BALAAM!!”.) And if you can't give birth, don't worry, you can still saddle yourself with an insane number of children: “**GOD WILL REQUIRE ADOPTIONS: WHEN A CHRISTIAN IS WEALTHY ENOUGH TO SUPPORT MORE THAN THE KIDS THEY HAVE: BUT CANNOT HAVE ANY MORE: BECAUSE OF BARENNESS!!” One of the reasons I decided to write the review this way was so I wouldn't forget to use this moue of incomprehensibility, from the same page as the last quote: “THE REAL TRUTH OF FAITH HEALING!! **THE REAL REASON WHY GOD HAS MADE US TO PRODUCE AND HAVE YEARLY>CHILDREN: IN OUR CHILD BEARING YEARS!! ** SO THEY HAVE TRUE INTO BALAAM MEDICAL WAYS: >>THEY HAVE TURN INTO>> A BIRTH CONTROL HIDDEN ABORTIONIST CHURCH OF FALSE CHRISTS!!”

[as a side note: there is, of course, an ulterior motive here. All too soon, Strong-Anderson becomes obsessed with another thread. To cut to the chase, I'll just quote the end of one of the sentences that dances around this point: “**SO THEY HAVE ROBBED GOD OF TITHES AND OFFERINGS!!” Yes, of course: it's always all about the banjamins.)

Which brings me to the next bit of this review, which will likely comprise the bulk of it: trying to hack Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson's grammatical code. If you look at the first sentence, it seems like a complete mishmash, with the exception of the double-asterisks. They seem to be setting off a clause. I had that in the back of my head as I've been reading this, and I think we may be able to find some other things like that as we go along; The double greater-thans, for example, surrounding “THEY HAVE TURN INTO” seem as if they may have meaning. (I am at present stumped about “YEARLY>CHILDREN”, however.) And of course it goes without saying that while she does not do it with periods, both question marks and exclamation points are doubled at the ends of sentences as what seems to be a matter of course.

One wonders, as an aside, how much formal schooling Strong-Anderson had, and how much of it included instruction in the English language.

Before page fifty, I have already abandoned the idea that Strong-Anderson is using double-asterisks to set things off; there are far too many places where we have an opening double-asterisk without a corresponding closer. Though this is not limited to double-asterisks; once, so far, I've encountered an opening double-parenthesis without a closer. (They are, so far, the only two parentheses to be found in the book.)

The farther we go, the scarier we get. It's not long before the promise given in the product description (“THIS IS A HOLYSPIRIT DIRECTED MANUSCRIPT”) shows up; Strong-Anderson truly believes she is just a channel for this stuff (“*GOD HAS GUIDED ME TO WRITE: EVEN THIS BOOK OF JUDGMENT: TO HELP > BRING THE CHRISTIAN MARRIAGES AND CHURCHES TO TRUE REPENTANCE OF THEIR FALL AWAY FROM THEIR FIRST LOVE AND FROM THE TRUE WAY AND COMMANDMENTS OF GOD AND JESUS CHRIST!!”), that it is being delivered to her by God himself (and/or Jesus) (“YES!! > THE HOLYSPIRIT SENT: THIS*LETTER AND BOOK: *TO ALL PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN THE ONE FATHER CREATOR GOD...”), that her point of view is the only valid one for the Christian faith (“SEEK:> TRUE REPENTANCE IS FOLLOW ME IN THE HOLYSPIRIT COMFORTER DIRECTION OF GODS VOICE AND WORDS OF EVERLASTING COVENANTS COMMANDMENTS: EVEN THROUGHN AND BY: RESTORATIONS OF HIS TRUE HOLYSPIRIT TITHING CHURCH: ?BECOME A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN WITH THIS HOLYSPIRIT ANOINTED BOOK OF REPENTANCE AND JUDGEMENT:> CALLING YOU INTO A TRUE LIFE IN GOD AND JESUS CHRIST!!”). She credits her teachings with, for example, the Winans family (for those unfamiliar, a famous gospel dynasty) suddenly starting to have children again (“**CAN WE SAY CHRISTIAN FAMILIES LIKE: THE WINANS: A AFRICAN AMERICAN SINGING FAMILY: **WAS HEADED FOR NON-EXISTENCE: BEFORE I WROTE THIS BOOK??”).

I'm not a psychiatrist by any stretch of the imagination, so it is not for me to be pitching opinions on the state of this woman's mental and emotional health. I'd be very interested to see what a psychiatrsit say, based on this manuscript. I'm betting a clean bill of health would not be forthcoming. I haven't even started with the persecution complex passages. Nor Strong-Anderson's attitudes on sex, which I'm sorry, but you'll have to read to believe. (Hint, for those who are going to try and do so in free previews: you want to look at chapter eight.)

The last chapter of the book, just to put the icing on the cake, is called “POEMS AND PRAISE TO OUR CREATOR GOD: AND TO OUR LORD AND SAVIOR: EMMANUEL JESUS WHO IS>
YOWSHWA MESSIAH CHRIST.”
(Yes, the hard carriage return is in the title.)

The first of these is called “*GOD THANK YOU FOR LIVING WATER!!”, and it contains these immortal lines:
“GOD I WANT TO THANK YOU TODAY:
FOR GIVING ME> HOLYSPIRIT HEALING AND CORRECTIONS!!”

If only those corrections had included spelling, grammar, sentence structure, caps-ism, and the fact that “holy spirit” is two words. (zero)"

Birth Control is Sinful in the Christian Marriages and also Robbing God of Priesthood Children!!,Trisha Harrington,"December 1, 2014",,"Because I enjoy these so much, I'm going to add some lovely quotes from reviews.

This book changed my life. After finishing, I spent a long time with my wife of four years, and we discussed our financial situation. The truth is, no matter how much we loved each other, no matter how perfect we were together, we could not afford to bring a child into this world, and we learned through this book that this was not God's plan. We carefully weighed our options. The first we discussed was forcible sterilization. This was something we had to think about for a while, because by the same logic, if we intentionally sterilized ourselves, it could either be one very big sin or an infinite volume of small sins, depending on whether God's sin-counter is digital or analog respectively. For the next few weeks we began to configure our home in such a way that would ultimately lead to accidental castration. Unfortunately, this ended not with joy, but with hideous defeat, as a bread knife intended to snag my low-hanging testicles accidentally caught the missus on the inside of her left thigh, severing her femoral artery. We were able to think quickly enough, using my belt and several pages from this blessed book to staunch the blood flow. Unfortunately, she ended up losing the leg. We realized the folly of our ways when the stump of her newly amputated leg awakened in me a long dormant acrotomophilia. It became apparent that it was not God's plan for me to remain with this woman, this beautiful woman, no matter how badly I wanted to care for her for the rest of her life regardless of what happened. Such a devotion was clearly sinful. So we decided it was best for us to part ways. We kissed one last time before filing the divorce papers, relegating us to a state where we could no longer have sex together no matter how badly we wanted it. Over breakfast one morning, my new ex-wife suggested something to me. She said that a strange feeling came to her in a dream the night before, where a beautiful, angelic woman visited her and began to disrobe. We realized with delight that my beautiful ex-wife was actually a lesbian, and that she would never have to use birth control again. That left me alone, delighted for the once love of my life, but wishing I could find a way to move on as quickly as she had. But now, having faithfully removed myself from the cardinal sin of a respectful, faithful relationship with a woman, I was finally shown the light. His name is Lance. Thank you, Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson, you helped set my life straight. Or... Well, gay. But you understand.

Truly a revelation to learn that my vagina is a sperm receptacle, a canal created by God for the sole purpose of serving Him and delivering babies in His name. Seven years of higher education were a total waste of time.

Well,I'm very grateful I came across this book. I was going to do the 'sensible' thing and plan my family according to my income,health and emotional issues,but now I realise I was wrong & sinful for wanting to have a 'manageable' number of kids.Unfortunately my spouse likes to do the wild thing a LOT and I now have 20 of God's little miracles to feed.Thankfully,I've been able to take a rest from my marital obligations lately as he's either left me or I've lost him under the pile of nappies.A shame,really,as permanently being in maternity clothes makes dressing choices in the morning SO much easier.Oh,well,the nappies come in handy for my untreated obstetric fistula. We're now living under a bridge,& I can no longer afford my anti-pychotic medication but God will provide.Especially as we're planning on eating little Arthur on Tuesday.If I sell Becky to the knackers we'll have food til Thursday.Now,excuse me,I must go.Eustace is near the drain hole poking something nasty with a stick and the blue goblins are telling me to drown Egibald.Which is insane.Eugenia is the one that has to go.Anyway,this book is a godsend for those days I feel inexplicably depressed & can't connect to my children.Probably just need to pray more.Eustace! I told you! Put that stick down now! You don't know where that dead body has been!! My one criticism is that the font is small and hard to read by candlelight. Other than that,it's a brilliant book.Thick enough to kill the cockroaches on the first go.

The haters here are ""gonna hate,"" but you should know that this new edition, all caps and excessive punctuation aside, is WAY better than the first edition of the book, which was written entirely in human excrement on the interior walls of the Athens Lunatic Asylum in Athens, Ohio.

There are 392 reviews as of today. I'm not sure anyone actually read the book, though.

Here is the last paragraph of the book's blurb:


Does the string of words above mean anything to anyone?
Why is this less offensive than porn?
If this is an example of freedom of religion, where does insanity start?


Look at what shelves this book is on. If it is 'did-not-finish' then I tried it & didn't like it. No, I do not have to finish a book to give it a star rating or a review. If you don't like that, tough. Have a nice day.

If the book is on my 'do-not-read' shelf then it was shoved under my nose or something about it made me think I might want to read it. I did some research & found that it was crap. I'll post why I think so & might even rate it with 1 star if it is really bad. If you disagree & want to discuss in the comments, you need to prove that it isn't with solid evidence. That means peer reviewed science, not anecdotes, opinions, or sites that are biased. Read the which is & follow its guidelines for providing proof. I'm willing to look at good evidence. I've been wrong before.

Birth Control is Sinful in the Christian Marriages and also Robbing God of Priesthood Children!!,Terri Lynn,"July 1, 2012",1.0,"I couldn't resist. I have studied enough psychology to be fascinated by people so brainwashed- in this case by christian mythology- that they go completely crazy. My main thought here was to wonder how long this woman has been off of her medication and why the doctor has not had her locked up for intensive therapy to try to restore her brain. Alas, apparently no one cares enough to try to help this poor deranged woman get a grip and get her back on her meds

If you have not had the misfortune to accidentally stumble into this rabbit's hole like Alice in Wonderland and me, let me go ahead and save you the trouble. Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson hates women (though she is one) and has bought into the women as root of all trouble in the world jazz from christianity which means that women must be punished by being second class citizens and obedient dogs. Women also must not think of using their brains, just their vaginas, ovaries and their uterus. To this end, you must get married and go from being your father's property to being your husband's property and doormat. You must forgo birth control. You must have the first kid 9 months after the wedding and have one every 9 months until menopause or your uterus falls out on the ground or your body gives up and dies which ever come later.

I am an Atheist with no gods, goddesses, imaginary friends or male bosses in the sky and admit I always wonder what is wrong with women who cooperate with a system that tears them down.

Come on Eliyzabeth, honey, get back on those meds. There is more to life than being a bitch dog or brood mare."

Don't believe me? Check out the free preview on Amazon.

Unfortunately, the book itself is no better, birth control argued against by Bible scripture and fallacious logic. Preventing a conception is better than preventing a birth - it is far better than abortion and we all know how much Christians hate that! as well as reducing population growth. There is no reason for us to not manage our population to conserve our resources and ourselves, and birth control simply is the best method to prevent the consequences of pregnancy (along with abstinence and monogamy, of course). Goodness, it is depressing to see that this kind of ignorance persists into the 21st century!

The writing itself is incoherent and rambling, and desperately needs an editor, because, god damn.

""Reparative therapy"" for homosexuality has never been shown to work empirically, despite all of the fancy studies this book cites. Some points I am forced to agree with - we have not yet that sexual orientation is 100% caused by genetics. But the way this information is twisted into a justification of trying to ""rehabilitate"" a ""hopeless"" situation makes me sick. Violently sick.

Please do not take this book seriously. It fosters hatred. I hope this man is religious, so that when I say I sincerely hope he goes to hell, it will actually mean something to him."

A Parent's Guide to Preventing Homosexuality,Plainbrownwrapper,"July 12, 2014",1.0,"Here's just a few facts about NARTH -- National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality -- which Mr. Nicolosi cofounded:

1. NARTH's founders believed that homosexuality was caused by “smothering mothers and abdicating fathers.” -- even though homosexuals are born into ALL types of homes

2. They are virulently homophobic -- Founder Socarides called homosexuality ""a purple menace that is threatening the proper design of gender distinctions and society”.

Founder Nicolosi was previously a spokesman for Focus on the Family. He has called homosexuality ""perverse and, in fact, unnatural"". He has also claimed that homosexuals want to normalize pedophilia and spread AIDS.

No bothering with scientific objectivity for these guys, nosirreebob!

4. Former member Wayne Throckmorton confirms the group's bias, saying: ""“When it comes to science, you can’t let your religious views color what is. And I think NARTH does that all the time"".

5. NARTH's conferences have featured such luminaries as Scott Lively (the pastor who claimed that gays orchestrated the holocaust, who cowrote , who then went on to actively work to get the anti-gay laws passed in Uganda, and who has also taken credit for the anti-gay laws in Russia) and Paul Cameron (who was thrown out of both the APA and the ASA for fiddling with research data).

6. Board member George Rekers was caught in 2010 with a rentboy he'd taken on vacation with him. He claimed the rentboy was there to carry his luggage.

7. In 2007, another NARTH member and advisor wrote an essay on their website in **support of slavery**. It said of slaves, in part: ""Life (in Africa) was savage ... and those brought to America, and other countries, were in many ways better off.""

8. Their research and claims of treatment success have been debunked many times in many different venues.

9. They have had their 501(c)3 status revoked by the IRS.

10. They are no longer accredited within the state of California."

I have not read it, and death would be merciful if you see me reading this. I am seriously considering hypnotherapy to purge that awful moment I read the title and blurb out of my head forever. This book is a pathethic, worthless piece of crap. Homosexuality is NOT a disease! I know so many people everywhere who are openly gay and not ashamed to admit it. If anything, this book is making homosexuals feel insecure in the world. There was a college boy 1-2 years ago that killed himself because two people caught him having sexual intercourse with another guy on tape. And there was another guy who tried to embrace his sexuality and joined a Gays-Straight alliance but was bullied to death about his sexual gender and killed himself. So, Cohen, think about that next time you want to publish a disgusting, disturbing, worthless excuse for a book that claims to ""heal homosexuals"" and could very possibly lead to thousands of homosexuals killing themselves. Homosexuals, bisexuals, gays, and lesbians: You ARE beautiful. And society (i.e. Cohen) can just screw it. What the world is coming to scares the hell out of me. What kind of society are we living in? Apparently, a homophobic, disgusting, screwed-up one. And oh, Cohen, you can just kiss my ass. And my fist.

I am, by no means judging this reader. There are many ignorant people. People that will believe that homosexuality is a illness or a mental disorder that is very much treatable.
Well, let us turn the tables…could you then turn gay? Could your husband?
I pretty much know that my very straight, very clean cut fiancé would faint away at the possibility of somebody making him have sex with men. What does that have to do with this? It’s basically the same thing. You can not compel people to go against their own desires and instincts. It is who they are.
The problem in this story is the author of this book. I mean…how dare he? Just…how dare he??

And if in your world it is so easy to change something METHABOLICAL and HORMONAL (and therefore pretty much un-changeable) because you term it a MENTAL illness, then why don’t you do some real good and focus on making people with Down syndrome not have it! How about that, mister? Too big for you?
(how dare he term homosexuality a mental illness any way!)

I don't like giving stars to something I haven't read, so I'm not giving out the one star I'm dying to give it. I'll let my opinion on this subject suffice. There's no way I'm supporting Cohen by spending my bucks on his book, so unless he's willing to give me a free copy to review, I won't read it. I'm pretty sure my local library doesn't have a copy of this book.

I'd just like to repeat that I find this topic highly - HIGHLY - offensive. I never went through any sort of childhood trauma and I can't (or want to) be ""cured"" of my true nature. Cohen was never gay; was bisexual but has now repressed that other side of him; or if he wasn't bisexual - just pure gay - he still is but has managed to let family/friends/society/religion/own-homophobia fill his head with the idea that his true nature can be ""healed"". So, so sad when people aren't allowed to feel free to be themselves.

Cohen, are you being attacked by GLBT and GLBT-supportive people? Yes. Why? Because, with this book, you're injecting ammunition into the guns of homophobics who have been attacking us since the dawn of time - oh wait, I meant to say since religion came about. We're living in the 21st century, buddy, where objective scietists have studied homosexuality. The church and homophobic societies are NOT objective scientists.

You know what, no. I'm not sorry at all.

How dare you not only write a freaking book that treats homosexuality as a disease that needs to be healed, but also outright say that people leading homosexual lives are ""incomplete"", ""wounded"" and just basically expressing Mommy and Daddy issues?

Seriously, fuck you Cohen.


You did not ""came out straight"". You just allowed someone else to tell you that you were doing the wrong thing by being who you were. You weren't lost and in need of guidance, you just bought the bullshit someone fed you, denied yourself who you were and what you wanted because it didn't fit with some intolerant asshole's vision of the world.

You know who gives gay people ""frustration and pain""? People like you, like the so-called psychiatrist that told you it was okay to hate yourself and bury who you were beneath a layer of falsehoods to please someone else's delicate sensibilities and whoever published this piece of shit with your hate and intolerance and your disgusting bigotry.

You know who's going to live a life with a ""dormant potential buried beneath emotional wounds"" and who will have to go through every day feeling nothing but ""frustration and pain""? You Mr. Cohen, when you realize the mistake you made in fitting yourself into the little box someone pre-determined for you. Because you allowed someone else to tell you were not good enough, that you were a mistake and that everything you loved was disgusting, a disease, simply because you were different. Turning straight and getting a wife and kids definitely didn't make you a better person, seeing as how you are willing to spread hate and intolerance with your book.

Funniest thing I have ever skimmed.

Ever.

I love how L. Ron felt the need to define words throughout the book. Words like idyllic, procreate, tome, pallid and testosterone. What does he think of his readers to have to define such challenging words? Perhaps they are not intelligent enough to use a dictionary.

I laughed out loud at this:




No wonder the world is so screwed up. And no wonder this was in the used section. I certainly would not want this rubbish on my shelves.

One word you don't need to define for your readers, L. Ron : crap."
Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Otto Lehto,"August 21, 2012",3.0,"The reviews here are largely based on the bipolar division into the scientology apologists, on the one hand, and the anti-scientology bigots, on the other hand. I consider myself neither.

This book contains fabrications, inventions, unsubstantiated claims and outright falsehoods.
It is the beginning of what, probably, started out as L.Ron Hubbard's conscious plan to start a cult based on himself, on his grandiose intellectual fantasies, and on his not-inconsiderable skills as a prose writer and armchair philosopher. This book is an example of all of those things.

Dianetics is the embryo out of which scientology grew. It contains the nuts and bolts of auditing (the process of dianetic therapy) and the basic terms of what later became the cult - and religion - of scientology, although still in the secular guise of self-help procedures and a kind of do-it-yourself, mock-up psychotherapy whose aim is the alleviation of ALL non-physical ailments of man and of ALL psychosomatic illnesses, and the achievement of the (rather improbable but alluring and fascinating) state of ""Clear"": a kind of perfectly rational, clear-headed Randian/Nietzschean class of ""supermen"" who are entirely without any hang-ups or other ""normal-human"" problems.

Such grandiose claims are, of course, without merit, but they are only one side of the coin.

The other side of the coin - the one that fascinates me - is the story of ""what could have been"": namely, how great a philosopher and thinker L.Ron Hubbard COULD have been, had he only been less - well, greedy and evil, I suppose.

The fabrication of physical ""engrams"" and the gnostic fantasy of the superhuman ""clear"" are only a twisted vesion of a true and perfectly reasonable philosophy hidden within the core of the book.

There are glimpses of his greatness in the book. The first half of the book is a kind of continuation of the work of centuries of moral philosophy aimed at the gradual perfection of man, combined with the modern science of Social Darwinist and psychological approaches to human life and human consciousness. The result is a reasonaby interesting thesis about the functioning of the human body. I find it very convincing. The bulk of the document, the root, is solid. Only the tree that grows out of it is rotten and murky. L.R. Hubbard unfortunately doesn't stick with solid reality but enters into science fiction territory as soon as you can say ""c-h-a-r-l-a-t-a-n""!

The sad fact is that Hubbard was not content to stick within clear-headed thinking, and instead followed the more selfish and self-serving urge (common to all confidence men) to ""spice up"" his sound philosophical ideas (most of which, to be sure, he borrowed from others, like Freud and Spencer) with a lot of outrageous nonsense and cultish fanaticism, to make it more sellable and appealing to desperate readers looking for a quick fix. This makes the whole book feel like a missed opportunity.

Of course, superficially the book was anything but a missed opportunity. After all, it spawned a whole religion and has sold millions upon millions of copies. But in the end, it is the sort of book that, in a hundred yeears, will be forgotten. It will never rank a great leap in human thinking, or achieve the sort of intellectual fame that Hubbard probably, despite all his BS, deep-down wanted. So Hubbard's story is more tragic than it appears. He COULD have been one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century. He had the brains and the writing skills and the charisma for it. Instead, he chose to be one of the most popular deceivers of mankind of the 20th century. That sordid business, to be sure, takes dedication. But it also means he missed the boat to greatness. He doomed himself to oblivion through a comet-rise to temporary fame.

I find it a sad but compelling story. The tale spun by the history of what followed is the story of a tragic man who couldn't choose between fiction and fact, and chose to blend the two in the most ingenuous - and arguably evil - way possible. He wanted to be Mohammed or Moses for the 20th century. He also wanted to be the Tolkien of psychology and the beloved of the rich and famous. He learned all the wrong lessons from Aleister Crowley. He took only the beastly aspects of the man and emulated his selfish pursuit of fame, ignoring Crowley's love of truth. He wanted to be a creator of worlds. The fact that he almost succeeded is a mind-boggling feat. It is also a cautionary tale of the lure of power and the cost of fame. Such fame is a devil's bargain. Hubbard stepped into the world of dreams and fiction and purposefully destroyed his own reputation in exchange of a few gold coins - and a few million gleamy-eyed followers!

But all of this does NOT negate the fact that Dianetics is a worthy book to study and read. It contains clever insights into the nature of the human condition. The combination of Darwinism and Freudianism is beautiful. It is the desktop writings of an almost-genius level of a thinker. It is ALMOST a science, it is ALMOST a psychology, it is ALMOST a philosophy of man worthy of the promised revolution of thought. And even though it is ONLY ALMOST all of those things, it still contains more than a few nuggets of real gold and philosophical insight - hidden within the steaming pile of malicious, cult-spawning manure.

Recommended with the caveat: upon first encountering this pile of dung, watch where you put your spoon, and don't eat the manure. Set it aside and dig for the ice cream and creamy goodness within. It exists. It is good. It is sad. It is beautiful. Taste it. Feel it. ""Build a better bridge!"" to quote the very last words of the book.

Learn from Hubbard, learn from Hitler, learn from Faust: when the devil comes, don't sell your soul."

Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Dan,"May 12, 2008",1.0,"I bought this book because I am reading it for a book club. Now, I am afraid eBay and Half.com are going to recommend things to me based on this purchase. So, on the the review.

This book is worthless. It's poorly written, disorganized, absolutely not science, and a pipe dream of a self-help process. That anyone was enticed to make use of it, not to mention actually got anything out of it is beyond my understanding. There are no new concepts of ""self-help"" or psychology in this book. It is just repackaged as a new ""science of the mind,"" which, again, is no science at all. This book is ABSOLUTELY NOT science! There is no place in a science book for terms like ""almost,"" ""seems,"" ""perhaps,"" ""wild guess,"" etc. When things are asserted as scientific fact, the words above have no place in the discourse. There are many, many examples of this throughout the book. In addition the author makes assertions as ""scientific fact"" with no proof or even explanation. It is extremely frustrating to read this as a person with a scientific education and background. I find it very hard to believe that anything in this book relating to the ""science"" of Dianetics is true or to be believed. There is nothing to convince the analytical person of the truth of any of the assertions.

Whether this book has helped anyone I cannot say. I will not speak to that. The first major sections of the book make becoming ""A Clear"" sound very desirable. However, to anyone who has an independent thought, it should sound like hogwash and/or a pipe dream.

The author is overly fixated on attempted abortion, something that may have been a problem in the first half of the 20th century in America but has ceased to be a serious issue in the 21st century. Keep in mind that this book was published in 1950!

L. Ron Hubbard was an outcast of society and a failed science fiction writer before he wrote this book. This is the kind of book that would come from the pen of a person like that.

I urge anyone who reads this book to take it from an analytical point of view and asses what you read carefully. Do not take what is presented here at face value."

Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Mike,"September 10, 2016",,"Prompted by the Church of Scientology I passed on the UT Austin campus nearly every day last month, I decided to finally watch Going Clear, Alex Gibney’s excellent documentary on Scientology. While watching the old footage of L. Ron Hubbard on his boat, king in his own self-created reality, I realized that he seemed somehow familiar. Not his physical body, perhaps, but something about his face, his expressions and mannerisms…

At one point in the footage, a reporter asks Hubbard, ""has it occurred to you that you may be quite mad?"" Hubbard smiles an insane little smile. That's when it hit me. Of course- L. Ron Hubbard is Donald Trump!

Hear me out. Trump University, for example, is not a university, in the same way the Church of Scientology is not a church; they're both bait-and-switch money-making schemes. Trump and Hubbard both tested out their acts in the realm of entertainment (Trump on TV, Hubbard in science-fiction pulp magazines, where he included in his short fiction many of the ideas that would resurface as doctrine in Scientology) before attempting to present themselves as serious to mass audiences. Trump has applied the sensibility of reality TV to politics; Hubbard applied the sensibility of science-fiction to religion. Both deliberately capitalized on Americans' susceptibility to celebrity (Trump on his own, Hubbard by starting the first church of Scientology in Hollywood and cultivating actors as apostles). Both encourage a nostalgia for a mythical time that never existed (Hubbard 75 million years ago, when humans lived, on another planet, much like 1950s Americans, Trump an undefined time when America was ""great""), and blame the loss of that past prosperity on enemies (Xenu the Galactic Overlord and roaming hordes of illegal immigrants, respectively). Trump’s campaign can be seen (charitably) as a satire of politics, and Scientology can be seen as a satire of religion.

I’m genuinely curious, come to think of it, why an organization like Scientology has never fielded a candidate for President (at least as far as I know). Surely Travolta or Cruise could easily get 5%, especially this year? I did a Google search, and unfortunately it does not seem as though the Church of Scientology has endorsed Trump. Disappointing, but there's still time."

Anyone who has read this book and has not been changed in some way shape or form, is simply not a normal person. This is one of those books that will change your life.

Any Scientologist will tell you that this book is a stepping-stone to many greater things, and they are right.

""What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn't even clear what such ""data"" would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations ... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science.""

For a ""religion"" that supposedly combines science and spirituality I find their disregard of the scientific process to be rather disturbing."

Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Kelly Flynn,"February 15, 2009",4.0,"This book is worth reading because 1)it's an interesting read, and 2) it's nice to learn about something that is somewhat prevalent in the news (Scientology). I know Scientology has gotten a lot of bad press lately, but I think the book can stand on its own as a good read. The book claims a lot, especially as it concerns healing the mind to the point where you don't get sick, your vision improves, and your memory jumps through the roof. These claims are a weak part of the book, but at least they keep you interested. There are hundreds of books that relate general health to the power of the mind/brain, and this one is decent. The book claims that only a specialist of Scientology can help clear your mind of the engrams (things in your unconscious that hold you back, make you depressed, etc.). The unfortunate thing is that it seems only the well-off can benefit from this specific therapy. The rest of us can at least think about the mind/body connection, and perhaps discover an alternative route to Scietology to help heal our brains."

Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Tom Croom,"February 13, 2011",2.0,"I was raised Roman Catholic as a child. Years of nuns and private schools armed me with ammunition needed to argue the Christian religion with an informed opinion. I make a big deal about this because I CAN'T STAND people who defend OR chastise religion without actually having researched it beyond ""that's what I was told in church.""

I was made to read the entire Bible when I was growing up.

Today I don't prescribe to any specific religion. I believe what I believe and that is good enough for me.

That said, Scientology has become THE ""go to"" religion for an easy joke about crazy people in our population (with Mormons hitting a close second thanks to South Park.) I have always avoided stating an opinion on Scientology since I had no basis for discussion.

Then I decided to read Dianetics.

[SPOILER ALERT] Yup. Scientology is Crazy McCrazy.

According to this book, all the negativity and stress I carry in life is due to my parents arguing before I was born and because (allegedly) my mother tried to have me aborted.

(I checked with mom and she claims this isn't true... but why would L. Ron lie?)

I DO RECOMMEND THIS BOOK if you are (or want to be) in sales. The writing used the assumptive sales method of stating absolutes. A number of times you read the phrase ""this is fact"" because, according to the author, it is. If you say something is true enough then people will believe it and (eventually) you will even get your own religion.

Credit where it is due, though: L. Ron Hubbard's explanation of the human mind in comparison to a computer was ahead if its time. Written in the early eighties, he is describing the concept of cleaning and defragging your personal hard drive: the brain. There's some logic there, but it's lost in the message he is trying to feed you with it."

Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,J.,"October 23, 2014",,"I picked up Dianetics in an effort to understand more about American religions. Did I read all 500+ pages? Was I thoroughly fascinated? Am I ready for my e-meter reading? Yes, yes, and no.

This review is mostly about the rhetoric of scientology and why (in my opinion) it is so persuasive.

The actual book looks like a cross between a scientific reference book and scripture. The layout allows for quick reading and contains a glossary of terms and a short section on Dianetics and L. Ron in the news. The books boasts about its spot on the NY Times bestseller list. The book promises that Scientology is eclipsing the known world, converts are pouring in, and that science is confirming every aspect of Dianetics.

The book is written in a scientific style. Terms are presented, defined, and then used in examples. Half of the book is an explanation of the scientific background for Dianetics and then second half is a manual for auditing (a type of therapy). As a self-contained work, L. Ron is very convincing. He is a master of rhetoric, appealing to both the intellect and the emotion. At the end of the book, one feels that L. Ron has explained life in a revolutionary way. You feel equipped to embark on a career as an auditor. Mr. Hubbard constantly urges readers to ""get busy and build a better bridge."" The tone is uplifting throughout, promotes peace (there is never ""justification for war""), and focuses on the good derived from obtaining ""release"" and becoming ""clear."" The ""Auditor's Code"" pleads that auditors not judge their applicants, listen thoroughly, not diminish emotional experience, express kindness. The book uses lots of power words, like: war, voyage, chaos, fundamentals. Everything is focused on the emotional experience of the individual. Every problem (from the common cold to bad eyesight) (there is ""no national problem in the world today which cannot be resolved by reason alone"" - presumably the reason of Dianetics) is overcome through Dianetics.

Although the idea of engrams is interesting, it has not been confirmed scientifically, despite the repetitive insistence to the contrary from Scientology. Engrams are just the beginning of Mr. Hubbard's inventions. Just as there is no outside, third-party evidence for transubstantiation, the law of attraction, or that native Americans are really Israelites. The religious have their internal, spiritual confirmations on each of these ""facts"" but there is no real world analogue. For my part, I'm skeptical that these are manipulations for praise and profit.

Despite the science, the uplifting tone, and purported emotional peace, I felt that Mr. Hubbard was thoroughly manipulating me. In my opinion, our mental and emotional lives are too complex for science. Religion rushes in to fill those gaps. And the fragility of our emotional lives can lead us to believe in things that are not true, rational, or just. In other words, we are wide open to manipulation and our minds too readily dwell in bias. As discussed in Thinking Fast and Slow by Kahneman, our minds search for a unified explanation of the world, cherry pick evidence, and reject contradictions. Overcoming these manipulations requires deeper thinking, comparing our ideas/values/religious ideas to reality and conflicting information, and identification of methods of manipulation and bias.

One common method of manipulation is maintaining a closed system. All religions reject information from outside sources. They have the same screed: society hates us because we have the truth, they reject and defame our prophets/leaders, you can't rely on their information. So as a religious convert, you are stuck reading the material sold at your church's bookstore. From the Scientology perspective, they offer a myriad of texts. One can obtain a doctorate in Dianetics. And judging from reviews of Dianetics, there are some extraordinary intelligent people invested in the cause. Dianetics states that it is based on ""considerable research"" and is scientific fact, not a theory, and is as ""real a discovery as gravity."" (Page 192). Throughout the book, Mr. Hubbard insists that it is based on scientific research but there is never a footnote.

A Scientologist can claim that Scientology is good and wholesome, there is nothing destructive or hateful about it (I could almost agree). And whether you believe it as absolute truth doesn't matter; just look at the good that it does/can do in the world. They could urge you to focus on the positive aspects -- just see the many testimonials, the charitable work, and the magnificent buildings (pictures in the back). A Scientologist friend urged me to keep reading more, keep investigating, open my mind and heart, and it will eventually become clear (no pun intended). But I am troubled by the lack of third-party evidence, the allegations of leader worship and abuse, of high financial contributions, and the thorough defamation of members turned detractors. Scientology, as with all religions, seek the emotionally vulnerable, make a convincing internal arguments, create systematic distrust in the outside world, and require absolute obedience and high financial contributions. Whether this good is worth the high cost, is up to the individual."
Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Jeremy Hurd-McKenney,"February 12, 2016",1.0,"Wow, this was a great big ticket to Crazytown--on the local, not the express, as there were frequent detours. In addition to possibly being the worst writer to ever pick up a pen, Hubbard seems to think that simply stating ""this is scientific fact; tests have been done"" is sufficient explanation for his strangely-focused-on-your-parents'-sex-lives pseudo-science, without once ever laying down any testing parameters or actual results. Instead, he uses a series of bizarre (and trashy) made-up dialogs and scenarios to illustrate our need to eschew the deep emotional scars we experienced in utero because of our parents' apparently endless amounts of affairs, abusive arguments, and constipation.

Ultimately, Hubbard's theory boils down to one thing: we are all fucked in the head because our mothers constantly tried to abort us with knitting needles (or in one graphically specific instance, a #12 gauge copper wire), and consequently need to spend countless hours alone in a room with a Scientologist, who will slowly bleed you of your traumas and dollars until you become Clear. After that, you'll never get a cold again. I wish I was kidding. To me, this is a dubious cornerstone on which to base an entire religion, but I guess it works for John Travolta.

I will never look at the Hollywood Christmas parade the same way again. Oh, and shame on you, Mother."

I was not looking for any religion and certainly didn't take away that's what was being pitched. I never attend any indoctrinations and didn't go become a Scientologist after reading it. In 1972-3 my father was involved in EST and was on a quest to find his center and to shed all of his stored up bullshit. We kids - my two brothers and I - were required to visit a family therapist where all of us - along with dad and his wife - went. It was largely due to his inability to be happy as a father. LOL. We ended up being introduced to T.A. (transactional analysis) there. Now that was pretty cool. Anyhow, after reading this, I thought that Hubbard was a bit of a genius actually. His postulation about cellular memory is what I remember as super relevant and that has stuck with me all these years.

Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Michael,"December 19, 2014",1.0,"Proverbs has much to say about fools. They despise wisdom (Proverbs 1:7, 22, 10:21, 23:9); they are right in their own eyes (Proverbs 12:15); they are deceitful (Proverbs 14:8) and scornful (Proverbs 10:23, 14:9). The wise are also given instruction on how to deal with fools in Proverbs. Instructing a fool is pointless because his speech is full of foolishness (Proverbs 15:2, 14) and he does not want wisdom and understanding (Proverbs 18:2).

The futility of trying to impart wisdom to a fool is the basis of Proverbs 26:4-5, which tell us how to answer a fool. These seemingly contradictory verses are actually a common form of parallelism found in the Old Testament, where one idea builds upon another. Verse 4 warns against arguing with a fool on his own terms, lest we stoop to his level and become as foolish as he is. Because he despises wisdom and correction, the fool will not listen to wise reason and will try to draw us into his type of argument, whether it is by using deceit, scoffing at our wisdom, or becoming angry and abusive. If we allow him to draw us into this type of discourse, we are answering him “according to his folly” in the sense of becoming like him."

I picked it up out of curiosity in the 1980s, and -- to be fair to the author and his followers -- only read half of it before throwing in the towel. The first half seemed to say that all of my problems could be understood, and then solved, by understanding them as ""ingrams"" (do I have that right?) or imprints inadvertantly made on my unconscious mind during brain surgery. Except I'd never had brain surgery, and still had problems (which I guess can't be solved since they can't be understood as having been made during brain surgery). Maybe the second half of the book is better; I would read it if I could just overcome the negative ingram made by the first half. Stick to Hubbard's ostensible sci-fi (if you must), and skip this sci-fi disguised as science and used as sham New Age religion for the profit of Hubbard's dubiously gained estate."
Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Carole Eddington,"March 28, 2017",,"One of the most important books every written. This is the scientific manual of the human mind. There's never been another book like it. The solution to mental problems, fears, obsessions, compulsions, depression, mental ""demons,"" psychosomatic illnesses, and all kinds of human aberrations is the therapy called Dianetics. This book explains everything about the mind, including the monumental discovery of the reactive mind. The goal of Dianetics is the state of Clear. I attained this state in the '70's. It is a precise technical attainment, and it is permanent.

All persons should read this book, if only to understand why it is vital to maintain silence around one who has been injured or is being operated on. Words uttered around one who is in pain and some degree of unconsciousness can alter his or her mental state for the worse. Learn about prenatal incidents!

It's just a useless jumble of facts that didn't connect for me and a very strange naming convention that makes every historical figure in this religion sound like something out of Battlestar Gallactica. Reading this is kind of like asking a four year old to explain the backstory to ""The Phantom Menace"". Having said all that, I still like ""Jerry Maguire""."

My life would not be today what it is had I not read and applied what's in this amazing book. What really hit home to in this book over other self-help books, is that it is so well researched and scientific. It is not airy-fairy and full of maybes. It is full of researched facts that anyone can go and try out for him/herself."
Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Paul Delaney,"June 15, 2009",2.0,"If you want to understand (and be utterly confused.) by the Church of Scientology then go ahead and read Dianetics. This is a terribly written, horribly self important and yes even dangerous book but I recommend everyone read it and think critically about it. Its my belief that Scientology is the perfect illustration of what a scam, what a con, what a mind fuck if you'll pardon my latin is. If you understand the con... you cannot be conned."
Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Kat Beats,"March 26, 2015",5.0,"Honestly this is an amazing book.
It explains SO MUCH about life!
I'm not sure why some people rated it badly but wow, if you can read and use the glossary at the back, it's amazing. It ACTUALLY explains how the mind works and it MAKES SENSE!
Finally someone with actual logical scientific thinking decided to do some research into how the mind works.
L. Ron Hubbard is a fantastic writer, and holy crap he had an enormous vocabulary!!!
Highly recommended! Onto 'Science of survival' now :)"
Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,Michael,"April 3, 2009",1.0,"When I completed reading it I thought some of the theories and applications seemed plausible and some were just total crap, but the more I thought about it the more I wasn't 'buying it.' I didn't even know what Scientology was while reading it. 20 years later, now that I know about Xenu, I'm embarrassed that I read it at all."

It was really really interesting and I think it was ahead of its time. I have seen it work because I tried it -- you can do the process just by reading the book. Go ahead, think for yourself. Also, I like the people I met who use it. They seem pretty cool to me! Maybe there is something to it."
Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Keith,"October 12, 2014",1.0,"I found myself in a youth hostel last night with nothing much to do for an hour or two except to skim the selection of books on the ""take a book/leave a book"" shelf in one of the hostel's common areas. What better time to wander into the dark weirdness of Scientology?

So, in short: Each page has about 5-10 footnotes, consisting entirely of definitions to words you already know, like ""physics"" and ""foundation"" and ""chemistry"" (no joke, I remember those all from page 2). However, there are usually not definitions to the words Hubbard made up, like ""havingness."" I don't care that I can figure out what ""havingness"" means; I would like it acknowledged as a made-up word. Especially since the book's introduction is entirely about looking up words you don't understand so as to better appreciate the text. Listen, stupid dead L Ron Hubbard -- if I'm the kind of person for whom ""chemistry"" must be defined, what do I do when I hit ""havingness,"" which isn't in any dictionary not written by aliens who live in volcanoes? Help a brother out, dog.

So, the rest of the book is pretty much the same as what you can learn from reading about Scientology on the googles. Basically existence is called a ""game,"" and ""auditors"" are Scientologists who have magical powers to help ""preclears"", which are folks who, like, need Scientology in their lives to get rid of the alien ghosts in their bodies. (Except for the alien ghosts part, all that is pretty much verbatim.)

Scientology is also based on the idea that we are always in a state of either ""create,"" ""create-create-create,"" (and yes, create-create-create is an actual term that gets used repeatedly) or ""counter-create."" Since this makes no fucking sense, there is also a page-long explanation of how when you hurt your leg, you've actually ""created"" a bad leg, and you create-create-create the bad leg until you counter-create it, at which point it is destroyed, revealing the good leg that was still there the whole time. Or something. Seriously, the book doesn't make any more sense than that paraphrasing just did.

There's also a lot of charts for all this stuff, giving you lists of all the emotions you have at various states of your existence and crap. It's supposed to be this 'scientific' approach to psychology through 'technology,' except that there's not really any science to it -- mostly just references to the two or three random books on actual psychology that Hubbard probably skimmed before deciding he could just make everything up. It's sort of like if a D&D nerd decided that stats tables and dice rolls could be applied to actual people. ""I'm sorry sir, but your Chaotic Neutral character alignment makes you unfit to be a preclear. Have a verdant cloak instead.""

Anyway, I thought this book would make me depressed and mush my brain with brainwashyness, but instead it just made me sad that people have been stupid enough to fall for this crap for decades now. Which is obviously just what you can say about any religion ever, but at least the Bible is an interesting read. This is just moronic and loony, like listening to a burnt-out hippie try to explain the establishment to you.

Oh, also? An entire section on how ""brown people"" and ""yellow people"" talk to the earth, and are stable but 'not progressive', while ""white people"" are full of anxious energy that causes them to need to save the world.

Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Matthew,"December 2, 2008",1.0,"Worth reading to understand the bizarre worldview of Scientologists. This book focuses on the peculiar ""psychology"" created by L. Ron Hubbard. It's entertaining to read as a psychologist, as many of the basic tenets of thought as Hubbard describes them have been well-researched and empirically disproved by cognitive psychologists half a century ago. A large cornerstone of the Scientology cosmology is the idea that it is based on reason and science (as opposed to the other legs it stands on, like alien reincarnation and Randian economic principles). This book alone clearly illustrates how deeply grounded this cult is in the sci-fi machinations of a poor author."

Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Greg,"April 30, 2021",4.0,"Update: Yeah.. on 2nd reading this seems less interesting.

As I said in my previous review on ""Scientology: A New Slant on Life"", I am trying to understand what Scientologists believe as it doesn't seem to be widespread public knowledge. Somewhat like the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which I am a member, there is a disinformation campaign that seems to try to discredit and misrepresent them led by apostates and other people out there with an axe to grind. In the spirit of Article of Faith number 11, which states: ""We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may."", I would like to say that I respect what other people believe and while I am not looking to join their religion, I am wanting to understand what makes them unique.

This is the book I thought that I had picked up when I picked up ""Scientology: A New Slant on Life"". From my understanding, this is considered a basic text explaining Scientology. The book explains many fundamentals and tenets of their beliefs including the eight dynamics, ARC triangle, the purpose of auditing, and their views on psychology.

I have found it often true that the ""milk before meat"" concept is used while sharing the gospel with LDS investigators and new converts until they are able to handle the more difficult doctrines. I understand why people are taught layer upon layer, but I remember at the time thinking it was a bit dishonest. I remember greatly struggling with the concept of going to the temple and performing ordinance work that it could be argued is based on Masonic rituals and not original or inspired.

Now I understand their purpose and that teaching in the temple is done by symbolism, but I remember wondering what sort of church I had joined when first exposed to it. I imagine that the doctrines of Scientology work in a similar way and that they avoid ""casting pearls before swine"" and this is why there seems to be some confusion about what they are about. Either way I found this to be an interesting read - finding a lot of information I agreed with, some that I did not. I don't think I will be joining them any time soon, but I trust that anyone who calls themselves Scientologist comes from a place of sincerity and I hope they find what they are looking for."
Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,James Mourgos,"December 8, 2014",5.0,"The book is a collection of articles written by Mr. Hubbard on some clear, basic fundamentals of Scientology. If you study this book to see what you can use and apply, then buy this book. If your attitude is such that you want to make fun of the book or want to prove it wrong, then go elsewhere.

I found the best parts of the book regarding how to deal with people especially with the chapter Life is a Game and the idea that people create problems was fascinating. Life is a game, and there are freedoms, barriers and purposes in anyone's life. Some people become the total effect of the barriers. If you tell them that this is a game (which I have), they'll look at you like you're crazy. They lost.

A good student of this subject will really get a lot out of the book. No one need join a group or get on a bandwagon. Just read the book, use it and get some positive gain.

Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Brett,"December 18, 2008",1.0,This book is just funny I have got to say. Kudos to a man that can make a religion off of pseudoscience and call it their own through books after books on the stuff. I had to read a little about it though to see for myself.

The second-half of the book, bizarrely, appears to outline instructions for a practitioner, describing how to 'process' an initiate. In short, if this is a book designed to enticle people to a new religion, I'm not surprised there are so few of them around..."
Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Matthew Brand,"June 22, 2015",1.0,"Just garbage. Poorly written and concepts are self-important drivel that don't actually say anything. Here's a prime example sentence:

Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Frank,"March 10, 2008",5.0,"For my view on why I don't believe in reviews, see my commentary on ""The Problems of Work"" in my books read. I am reading these basic Scientology books because they were recently re-released in Summer 2007 after a pain-staking 20 years of research into the original books and discovery of mistakes made by transcriptionists which made many of the books incomprensible. The publisher had each book checked against the original notes and dictations of L. Ron Hubbard. In having read The Problems of Work and this one in their entirety (original version) I couldn't believe the difference. It made the information both clear and, more importantly, USEABLE. I was able to use it.

What mostly interests me in this book is what L. Ron Hubbard said in Chapter 8 of the book: ""Scientology does not teach you. It only reminds you. For the information was yours in the first place."" This rang true for me because everything I have learned and used so far, I found I somehow always ""knew"" was true. What being reminded of it did for me was to make it mine - mine to use to some result.

This was the perfect follow-up book to Problems of Work and I was glad I read them in that order. It gave me the tools to really let go of problems I consider trivial and never have them bother me again while adding some new ""problems"" which were mroe along the lines of problems you face in any game. These are problems we like to have and - who diesn't like to play a good game once in a while."
Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,dogo,"March 1, 2018",1.0,"I am still undecided upon the stars, as this is a great piece of literature on brainwashing, I think. Here are some of my favorite passages:

What Special Use Does Scientology Have? 
Scientology does things for people where nothing has been done before. It makes people well from illnesses which were once considered hopeless. It increases their intelligence. It changes their competence and betters their behaviour. In addition to these it brings them a better understanding of life. One outstanding thing which it does: it alleviates burns received from Atomic Bombs. 
Scientology is the only specific (cure) for radiation (atomic bomb) burns. Scientology processing given to persons burned by radiation can alleviate the majority of the difficulty. This is true even when the person who is treating (auditor) is not completely trained. -p13

Scientology organizations contain more members than all other mental health organizations combined. -p13 (I think hubbard means asylums)

Is this CYCLE OF ACTION THEORY USEFUL? It is. So long as we believe that we have to destroy with force in order to destroy at all, as long as we think in terms of destruction, we have chaos. -p16

Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Joseph,"April 27, 2014",2.0,"lame.

the book is completely condescending. at one point i recall the author stating something to the effect of: ""if you don't understand anything in this book, reread it until you understand it."" it's also got a glossary in the back which is strange. further, there were illustrations to the ""belief"" system of scientology which was weird.

some interesting things though: how ""auditing"" was explained and should be implemented. how scientologists view life as a ""win-lose game."" there were other metaphors for thought which i found a bit strange. i wish there were more about the scientologist's beliefs on creation, etc.

it does give a good explanation about the theories behind scientology and how screwy they are. i find that the book, albeit weird, was a good intro to the cultish religion. it's a shame that the author is an alum from my alma mater."

I know some people think Scientology is a crazy religion, with crazy practices...but is it really any different than any other organized religion?

Even though it can at times get a bit lost in Hubbardisms, which look like:

Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Stephanie,"November 25, 2018",1.0,"I picked this up out of curiosity. You always hear...interesting....things about Scientology and I was hoping this would provide some insight into what it's really like. It did a little, I guess? I get the feeling this only scratches the surface, and of course it leaves out the bad stuff. Here's what I gathered from my perusal: Scientology is mostly about making up stupid words like ""havingness"" and ""beingness"" and ""thetan"" either a) to replace words that already exist and that work quite nicely or b) to describe stuff that they made up. It's also about making wild statements about things like the afterlife, claiming that these statements have been scientifically proven, and then offering no citation or details whatsoever to go along with those statements (hmm wonder why.) I think my favorite chapter is one in which the author earnestly explains that the way to solve your problems is to think of other problems that you could have instead of the one you have. Then when you get back to your original problem, it will have been solved. Wow. Gee, I'll go tell all the people I know who are dying of cancer just to think about having leprosy instead. That should fix the cancer problem for sure.

You know how I said this book leaves out the bad stuff? Well, it does for the most part. There are a few parts where it ventures away from just giving ludicrous self-help advice and steers into scary cult territory. For example, there's a chapter on ""The Code of a Scientologist."" The very first item on the list is this: ""I pledge myself to hear or speak no word of disparagement to the press, public or preclears concerning any of my fellow Scientologists, our professional organization or those whose names are closely connected to this science."" Anytime you come across a religion, or government, or ANYTHING, that says you shouldn't, and in this case, CAN'T, question it....frickin' run the other way!! A statement like that should raise a field of red flags and set off a warehouse of alarm bells in your mind. Not good, man. Not good."

Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Lucy Carter,"April 2, 2023",3.0,"Scientology:
Some things I enjoyed, some things concerned me, some things I forgot about, and other things I just couldn't stand. Mr. Hubbard probably was on to something, and some of his philosophical musings were profound and eloquent, but as one may notice, this book found its way in my mediocre-atrocious shelf. It's not as bad as I anticipated it to be, but it's not like it will sink into my head and change my life.

Scientology is a belief system that states that life is like a game, in which every individual must attain and , or have full control and independence over their own existence. A person has a spirit referred to as a , and the can act as an entirely separate and independent entity from the body.
Scientology is believed to help civilize people spiritually, mentally, and intellectually. A person can train themselves to do this through a series of drills conducted by a person referred to as an . These drills are supposed to help people become trained in the game of life.
Other fundamentals in Scientology include the , which is pretty much the way humans view how life works. It is labeled as ""CREATE (be born)-SURVIVE (live)-DESTROY (die).""

I admire Mr. Hubbard's method of bringing awareness to the , as he likes to put it. He formulates his own system of terminology for certain fundamentals, defines the terminology in this system, and, at times, even forms his own neologisms to encapsulate his ideas. and , for instance, are his own neologisms that are meant to denote the act of being, or existing, and the act of having possession (especially of oneself and one's life), respectively. Sure, these terms do sound a bit unnatural and ""made-up,"" as my mother would probably put it, but I could not help but admire his ability to use words to develop and bring awareness about Scientology's principles.
A lot of new terminology you should know is written in all capitals. Some are pretty self-explanatory, and are not directly defined due to being self-explanatory, but the very action of writing them in all capitals is convenient and makes me more aware of how things work. Others are treated like dictionary entries. You will have a term in all-caps, a colon or equal sign in front of it, and a definition.
I enjoyed how Hubbard was able to give new terminology to encapsulate the ideas, because like with studying any other thing, you can logically deduce something without knowing the word for it, but having the word brings awareness and makes it more memorable. For instance, if someone were to say, ""Mermaids exist. No one has proof against this,"" I could deduce that this is logically fallacious. Just because no one has proof against a claim believed to be true, or proof for a claim that is believed to be false, doesn't mean that the claim is true or false, respectively, because you are appealing to a lack of evidence to support or refute a claim, not evidence itself. This is a legit strategy, but then, you could learn that this fallacy is formally known as an Appeal to Ignorance, so instead of having to deduce the inaccuracy of an Appeal to Ignorance every time I encounter one, I could have a convenient term to take and apply in the situation.

There were some wonderful insights Hubbard provided. I liked what he said about and a person's identity. You could easily try to assume another person's habits and mannerisms (valence) just to compete in the game of life, for instance, to get someone's attention, but you are merely assuming a valence identity, not your real identity. I like how Scientology establishes human beings as independent beings.

The definition of terminology sometimes went a bit too far, under certain circumstances, to the point where it seemed as if the author was doubting the audience's intelligence. There were times, especially around the beginning, when Hubbard would write a sentence with a particular word, and then put a parenthesis that contained a synonym after that word. What was problematic was that there were words he did this to that many people would probably know, or could just use a dictionary to look up. Take the following quote, for instance:
""
It makes sense for the author to put parenthesis after the term auditor, since auditing a person in the game of life is specific to Scientology, but putting synonyms for and seemed a bit redundant. I'm pretty sure many people know what drills are, and anyone who knows about school should know what means. Here's another quote like this:
""
""
I'm pretty sure we all know what illnesses and companies are, thank you very much.

Another criticism I have for this book is the chapter. I was actually very excited to read about the chapter, because I wanted to confirm that people were being helped by Scientology, but I hardly saw any numbers. There were very few percentages. The quote about curing 70% of Man's illnesses was part of the page, and I think it was the only real ""statistic"" in the page. However, the statistic seems a bit sus. What do they mean by ""illnesses?"" Do they mean illnesses or illnesses? Does it refer to illnesses you can get from an environment (like a disease) or an illness that you can inherit from someone? There are different things that can be seen as an ""illness."" The statistic is just too broad and ambiguous. Plus, how is it even possible for a single belief system to do that? I am not trying to doubt that it can do this, but I wish there was a better explanation behind this.

The part in the section actually made me doubt Scientology's validity. It merely asserted that Scientology was valid, but it did not show the numbers or logic behind it. Just look at the following quote:
""
""
The author merely claims that Scientology is rigorously tested, but it never mentioned who tested it, how it was tested, and how the results of the actual tests corroborate the validity of Scientology. It said that large companies use Scientology, but which ones? And are these companies actually successful?

Scientology does have a lot to offer but it falls short . I think intensive Auditing might help some people, and that's good for them! But the ""Vital Statistics"" section was just proof of how narrow and unsubstantiated some aspects of Scientology can be. I think that might be the reason why some people consider Scientology a pseudoscience---they make assertions that are not scientifically or statistically backed.

Then, there were some principles that I just couldn't agree with. Take this paragraph:
""Unlike yellow and brown people, the white does not usually believe he can get attention from matter or objects. The yellow and brown believe for the most part (and it is all a matter of consideration) that rocks, trees, walls, etc., can give them attention. The white man seldom believes this and so is likely to become anxious about people. Thus the white saves people, prevents famine, flood, disease and revolution for people as the only purveyors of attention are scarce. The white goes further. He often believes he can get attention only from whites and that yellow and brown people's attention is worthless. Thus the yellow and brown races are not very progressive but, by and large, saner. And
the white race is progressive but more frantic.""
Hubbard actually has pretty radical views on race, at least during the time it was written in, but as people may know, the paragraph still contains racial stereotyping that I believe is detrimental to both Caucasians and people of color. The ""yellow and brown races"" can still be progressive, and the ""white race"" can still be sane. I'm pretty sure most Scientologists of this generation do not give credence to the paragraph above, but if you are a parent reading this to your child for a bed time story, you should consider this.

was an okay book overall. I don't think it is that deserving of the low 2.56 avg. star rating it has on Goodreads, but I do empathize with the people who do not like it much. This book is worth reading, but you should not spend hours trying to search for it, nor should you purchase it. That's why I found this free PDF to this book, so you can read it without having to spend unnecessary amounts of money and time on it:


Happy reading!"
Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Bilbo,"June 6, 2018",1.0,"Garbage from a cult leader.
A person researching religions could waste less time to just to look at Buddhism, for that is what Scientology is. L Ron Hubbard loved Buddhism. Scientology also has many links to Gnostic thought. One could also draw many parallels with Mary Baker Eddy's cult, ""Christian Science"" which is neither Christian nor scientific.

The basic premise in this book is that our life, now on this earth (or rather what we perceive to be our life) is just a game. ""One could say, then, that life is a game"" (pg 72) ""Life can best be understood by likening it to a game. … it might strike you as peculiar that people would go on living or would enter into the 'game of life' at the risk of all the sorrow, travail and pain just to have something to do. Evidently there is no greater curse than total idleness."" (pg 62). It is a state of consciousness that we enter into willingly but upon condition of forgetting. ""In para-Scientology there is much discussion about 'between-lives areas' and other phenomena which might have passed at one time or another for heaven or hell, but it is established completely that a thetan is immortal and that he himself cannot actually experience death and conterfeits [simulates] it by forgetting."" (pg 92) He states this premise of life being a game 25+ times in this book as if to drill it into your head, that we as thetans (immortal spirits or gods that pre-existed our material birth) entered into for something to do, out of a state of boredom; a game to play to challenge us. ""[Scientology] is intended as an assistance to life at large, to enable life to make a better civilization and a better game."" (Pg 97)

Like Gnostiicsm or the Doctrine of ""Maya"" in Buddhism, the reality that we see or think is real is not real. You know sort of like the Matrix movies (whose writers said was written in large part based on Buddhism). Hubbard states on page 23, ""Reality is the way things appear. Reality is apparency. To do anything about reality, one must search into and discover what underlies the apparency."" But his definition of apparency on page 20 is ""Apparency = appears to be, as distinct from what actually is."" So Hubbard is speaking doublespeak. Inserting his own definition into his statement then, he is saying ""Reality is [what only appears to be, as distinct from what actually is].""

Reality is what only appears to be but is not real?
Does that sound like a sane man? Or an insane man?

Fortunately Hubbard clears this up for us (sarcasm) on page 26, Hubbard says, ""For example, a man is sane. He gets the idea that it would be better to be insane. He starts to go insane (having created it) and then does numberless things in order to stay sane. Here he was already creating the state of sanity. He counter-created insanity. He then counter-created sanity against insanity.

The theme of reincarnation is apparent! in this worldview, though L Ron never uses the word in this book. But in this scheme it is not reincarnation proper but more of using up ""lives"" in a video game idea or that in this dreamworld dying is called a-""Wake"" which these gnostic interpreters think means actually waking up to the actual reality. In the chapter entitled ""The Parts of Man"" where Hubbard describes his gnostic or platonic view of our real selves living in these temporary and disposable material bodies, he says, ""the person, having exteriorized [astral projection/ out of body experience type of idea or as he says on pg. 85, ""exteriorization or the departure of the soul""], usually returns to a planet and procures, usually another body of the same type of race as before"" (pg 92).

To finish this review, I'd like to finish with Hubbards words on page 168, ""Scientology does not owe its help. We have done nothing to cause us to propitiate. Had we done so, we would not now be bright enough to do what we are doing.""

As a Christian, I found this comment with the word ""propitiate"" interesting. What does the word mean? Oxford dictionary defines it this way, ""the action of propitiating or appeasing a god, spirit, or person."" So Hubbard must either mean that they don't need to appease, or apologize to anyone because they have done nothing wrong. Or on the other hand he may mean that they have no need to make a sacrifice to God or gods for anything they have done.

In pagan religions, people sacrificied to gods, some even to the point of throwing babies into the river, Ganges, to appease the gods. In Christianity in contrast, God himself in the person Jesus Christ made propitiation for our sins. This is mercy. This is grace. You can read more about this in Hebrews 2:17, Romans 3:24-26, 1 John 4:10, and 1 John 2:2."

Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Alpi Badger,"January 23, 2023",1.0,"This ""book"" is utter garbage, just like all the other literary efforts of Mr. Hubbard. It is probably the worst book ever written (yes, I'm aware of the ""50 shades of Grey"" existence).

Years ago I was interested in the Scientology ""philosophy"", mainly for 2 reasons:

1. I wanted to understand how to establish a church (just for tax evasion purposes, duuuh) and get rich very quickly by manipulating a few very wealthy people with obvious mental deficiencies;

2. I was very curious about the heavy drugs L. Ron Hubbard was on during the process of writing this gibberish (as a pharmacist and from a purely professional perspective, I promise).

Needless to say/write, I couldn't finish this tremendous rubbish, mainly because it is absolutely unreadable. Some people are saying that it's a great comedy book, but those people probably think SNL, James Corden and Jimmy Fallon are funny too.

If you are a committed atheist just like me, please check the Flying Spaghetti Monster Church. It makes so much more sense than the scientology nonsense.
Greed is not good, Mr. Hubbard, even if Gordon Gekko says so.
Pastafarianism über alles!

Last but not least: I'm so sorry about Tom Cruise. He is indeed a brilliant actor, probably not the brightest human being, though.

One star is too much."
Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought,Albany Andaluz,"July 10, 2018",2.0,"Hubbard opens this piece of literature with the statement: Scientology is an applied religious philosophy. My questions were answered. I sought interest in this book for what it could teach me about the creation of the misunderstood religion, from the creator.

It took a while for me to become acquainted with the language choices of the author. He seems to give scientific names to otherwise considered spiritual phenomena. That fabricated language of ethereal rationale created by Hubbard seems to be the mating call for non-spiritualists. If one is an atheist, for example, there could be an initial resistance towards the word ""spirit/soul,"" hence the need for secular nouns like thetan.

All in all, I find what I read to be just like all denominational texts -- where one is told that this is /the/ way to live, followed by the claims of the potential one can reach while under the guidance of said text. I found it interesting and would read again, to try to further understand the basis for the denomination."

Handbook for Mortals,Kai Spellmeier,"February 27, 2018",,the drama surrounding this book is more interesting than the book itself
Handbook for Mortals,Mari,"September 29, 2017",1.0,"Thoughts while reading here: #snarkformortals

Video review with lots of spoilers and feelings about why this is the worst.

I'm only giving this 1 star because I give everything at least one star. This was without a doubt one of the worst things I've ever read. To give you context, it's less harmful than Fifty Shades, but probably worse in terms of writing. I hated Bella more than Zade, but this has even less plot than Twilight, if you can imagine.

That said, apart from anything you've heard about Lani Sarem and the release of this book, Handbook for Mortals is unquestioningly awful. There is no plot, it's terribly written, I refuse to believe an editor even looked at it, and I would go so far as to say that some parts read like even Sarem never read them back to herself.

It's obvious stand-in fic and of the bad kind, because the entire plot really and truly is, ""everyone tells the author stand-in how beautiful she is."" The rest of the ""plot"" is the set-up with no payoff. The rest of the plot is in the damn blurb because it's that light. It's also terribly transparent, from how the MC is described (exactly like Sarem), to the inclusion of ""celebrities"" or references to the same. I mean, the author stand-in is caught in a love triangle with a man named Jackson (as in Rathbone because twilight 4 eva) and a man named Clark Kent. I wish I were making that up.

Add to all of that the author's behavior, as if people owe her or her story anything, and hot damn. She gamed her way to #1 with a book that could be easily bested by the fanfiction you wrote in middle school. Hate it.

I thought I would add more to this review, but there's little else to say, though here is a list of the best worst things that happened:
- On a windy day, Zade wishes there were a photographer around to capture her hotness.
- Everyone grinds their teeth when they are mad.
- The author prints the lyrics to Dixie Chick's Wide Open Spaces and then tells us why they perfectly apply to the scene. Yes.
- The magician's name is Charles Spellman.
- Before someone knocked on a door, she described how he made a fist.
- After saving someone from drowning, Zade decides to grab a guitar and play outside while sitting on a curb, soaking wet.
- Seriously, the main love interest's name is CLARK KENT.
- The other love interest is in the Plain White Ts as in the actual real life band and all the members are name dropped but there is no Jackson in the band but now there is.
- The MC randomly runs into Carrot Top and Wayne Newton at the mall?
- The MC uses her magic against a teenager working at Hot Dog on a Stick.
- She prints emojis in like 72 point font in a scene like a cool person.
- ""Make out with tongue.""
- David Copperfield-esque character is the MC's dad because that's not creepy.
- The MC tells us about stuff that happened while she was in a coma (or whatever) by magically stealing memories from people.
- The book ends with ""And they lived happily ever after. OR DO THEY?""
- The author quotes Stephenie Meyer at the beginning of the book and thanks her at the end, and spells her name incorrectly both times."
Handbook for Mortals,Elle (ellexamines),"February 27, 2018",,"AND NOW THERE ARE FAKE RATINGS THIS IS SO... WILD

oh my god. she bought her way to the top of the NYT list."
Handbook for Mortals,Beth Cato,"September 24, 2017",1.0,"I received this ebook through the publisher via Netgalley. As a published author myself, I am well aware of the way that author Lani Sarem and her team manipulated the New York Times list. I also know that the Goodreads ratings for the book consist of mostly one-star ratings due to the book's reputation and the sample available on Amazon.

I don't rate or review any book unless I finish it. I wanted to judge Handbook with as much fairness as I could, even knowing its history, so I endeavored to read the entire thing. I finished it.

If this had been any other book, I would have declared it Did Not Finish (DNF) in the first few pages.

reminds me of my first novel efforts, the ones I trunked and will forever more keep trunked. Because of that, I sympathize with the author to a degree. I wish she had had other experienced authors around her to offer honest feedback--or maybe she did, and she ignored their feedback to stay true to her vision. I did that with my first novel attempts, too.

The book reads like a non-reader's mistaken assumptions of what YA is, though this book is not YA (the heroine is about twenty-five). For a proclaimed fantasy book, magic is barely present (and very little of it actually done by the heroine), and doesn't make sense. It's... kind of like a romance, but with no chemistry. The entire middle of the book consists of dating scenes interspersed with clothes shopping.

The first few pages show an ignorance of novels and how they are formatted at a basic level, as it actually has a foreword introducing the author. An intro like this is included for anthologies or collections, not for a debut book. I don't know who the author is and her movie fandom creds aren't relevant. The book needs to sell itself.

As begins at chapter 0, we meet Zade as she argues with her mother and departs Tennessee for her new job in Las Vegas. The narrative is overwritten--again, a common flaw in early novels efforts and rough drafts, period--and the paragraphs are dense, with the dialogue often buried. Zade's actions here are the only time in the book that she shows agency.

Agency means the character instigates the plot. She/he makes the decisions and carries the book, rather than doing what author-god decrees. Agency within a plot is a tricky thing to master; honestly, my agent and editor still ding me on this during revision stages.

But this point of criticism leads to another issue: there is no plot in . She goes to Vegas and joins an illusionist's show, and starts going on a lot of dates with Mac and Jackson, though all men find her to be incredibly hot and almost all women loathe her. This is explained at one point as a side effect of Zade's immense magical power. At one point, some other magic user attacks her, and makes an odd cameo appearance later; the ending implies a second book is supposed to explain this person, but it has zero bearing on anything in this book.

This book is about dating. And shopping. But for a book that tries to play up the love triangle angle, ala , there is no triangle. Mac has all of the emphasis and character development--actually, he's the only character who has an arc and develops in any way, and he's the only one who acts at the climax. He has many of his own scenes shown in italics (though the use of italics is inconsistent and confusing, as some other characters' POVs are seen through it sometimes). The other character, Jackson, is a musician and good-looking, and has the perk of actually believing in the abilities of tarot readings (one of Zade's skills), but it's pretty clear he has no chance with Zade.

As for the romantic dialogue, it's... George Lucas-esque. That goes back to that matter of agency. As all men love and want Zade, she doesn't need to make any effort to win over Mac or Jackson.

Zade had potential to be an interesting character. The book only expresses vague ideas of what her magic is actually like and there is zero growth in her abilities--the kind of thing an actual fantasy book needs. Zade is perfect in every way, a cliché Mary Sue (again, a new author trait). Everyone thinks she's hot. Compliments on her hair are a regular theme (it reads like a Sally Beauty Supply ad at a few points, quite literally). She can also play guitar and sing, and she loves ""crotch rockets"" just like Mac. And as the ending of the book shows, she is morally bankrupt.

I suppose I should get to the ending.

Most books use an ending to show how the hero/heroine has grown throughout the book. It's an opportunity for a grand show of powers, a confrontation with a villain, etc. But this book has no character growth, and while it has a few unpleasant people, there is no villain.

Instead, Zade tries to pull off a grand illusion during the Vegas show that utilizes ""dangerous magic."" She uses Mac as her anchor for this magic, but he's mad at her, so he steps outside to smoke. (Yes, there are several points like this that make no sense--he could step out for a phone call, or be sick, or go on vacation, etc). Cue her magic going awry. The show ends, and she goes off stage, falls unconscious, and starts bleeding everywhere. At the hospital, the doctor says Zade is internally bleeding and will quickly die.

Zade is rushed back to Tennessee to her mother's advanced magical care, where, as Zade is bleeding to death, her estranged parents reunite and casually tell Mac the story of how they met. There is zero tension throughout this long section. Zade's loved ones are literally at the kitchen table, drinking tea, and reminiscing about the late 1970s as Zade bleeds out in the next room.

How do we know this? That goes to the morally bankrupt part: Zade has ripped memories of all these events from her parents, Mac, and everyone who witnessed her collapse in Vegas. The very end of the book has some vague mention of her getting permission from those closest to her, but she obviously couldn't get this from everyone, as her magical skills are a big secret.

So yeah. She thieved memories from almost everyone she knows, and also rifled through her parents thoughts when they were young and horny, which has another level of violation and squick. There is absolutely no moral consideration of these actions.

Also note that Zade falls unconscious at 67% through the ebook. She wakes up at 91%. The climax, such as it is, consists of Mac plunging a dagger-that's-really-like-an-EpiPen (that's how the book explains it) into her heart.

She recovers, returns to Vegas where everyone greets her with a surprise party (the proper welcome for someone who nearly died), and her estranged parents remarry. The book ends with the promise (threat?) of a sequel to come that will explain the weird magical girl who tried to blast Zade at the mall.

everyone talking about the author & this book"
Handbook for Mortals,Estance Veyrac,"February 2, 2023",1.0,"[I've amended this review in early 2023 as I keep get notifications for it so I want to be sure to be as accurate as possible & give context because it's been a long time now, so people coming across my review might benefit from a quick explanation]

I didn't read this book, I only read the few extracts that were circulating around the time this book was released & immediately became a scandal. Upon its release, the book took the n°1 spot of the NYT YA bestseller's list which was previously held (& continued to be held thereafter for many more months) by Angie Thomas's The Hate You Give.
Taking over the n°1 spot of the NYT bestseller's list gathers attention & no one had ever heard of the book or its author, so something had to have happened, a loophole must have allowed a book to ""steal"" the spot (a scheme of fake massive pre-orders that weren't fulfilled or something like this, I don't remember well). That loophole was closed, rules around the bestsellers lists were tightened & the n°1 spot was taken away from the author.

Because of this scandal, the book received attention it would never have been given under normal circonstances. And had the book not been this appauling, it wouldn't have stirred such a controversy. The most point being the white author chose to describe her character as of a Roma (Rrom). I choose to write a review for a book I didn't read to give context on that, as it wasn't much talked about by people at the time.

In France, the Rrom community is the most persecuted, overtly hated & discriminated against. In the past, after centuries of persecutions, Rroms were targeted by the Third Reich & thousands of them died in an orchestred genocide. Lately, the dormant racism faced by Rroms has picked up, in part due to a written police ordonnance asking cops to specifically target Rroms which led to thousands of Rroms been deported. The life expectancy of Rroms girls is the lowest of all in the whole of Europe.
If you don't know much about this, you can look up ""Roma + life expectancy"" & you'll find many official reports from the EU & other reputable international organization. Here is an article about the situation of Roma/Rrom people: )

It's not okay to appropriate an ethnic origin & a culture, it's never okay. Attributing a mysticism & giving ""magic powers"" to Rroms is incredibly dangerous. It aggravates a context already filled with biais against Rroms. Prejudice against Rroms is not a thing of the past, in 2022, baseless accusations & rumors of Roma women abducting children once again circulated widely in France.

(I didn't really edit the rest of the review I made back then because I don't remember if it's pertinent or not)

- White-slim-pretty-privileged-cis-heterosexual-woman describing herself as ""different""? This is not different, this is the same, this is not special, this is what we are told over & over we should conform into. This is not different, this is boring.

- It's plain bad writing. This is the writing on the first draft you've ever written at 12 that you end up scraping entirely because you can't believe how badly your writing was when you first started. It okay to write this. It's not okay not to question yourself, maybe ask around for opinions & amend your work in order to make it better.

- If you annonce in the summary on the back cover that your book has a love triangle, what I hear is, the life of the character is so easy, what with them being white, allocishet people with money who don't really have much to complain about, that you made up some fake emotional storyline so the book isn't just a bad description of the dream life you made up for yourself in your head.

- Everything is political. Stumping on The Hate U Give, a well-written, deep, riveting, smart & complex book about racism written by a black woman, by using influence & money your white privilege gives you access to is disgusting. The book whose place you stole isn't just any book & it matters that THUG is the book whose place you stole."

Handbook for Mortals,S.K. Gregory,"August 25, 2017",1.0,"I have read a lot about this book in the last few days, but I'm going to ignore it and base my review on the book itself. I was given a free copy for an honest review. The idea of someone with magic, working on a magic show seemed like an interesting story.
There are many issues with this book. Over looking the issue of copyright infringement through the use of several song lyrics, the main character is quite unremarkable. In fact she seems quite conceited at times, but because she stammers when nervous she is supposed to be relatable.
The love triangle doesn't hold up well. Obviously drawing from other books, the author tries to create tension between Mac and Zade, but it is completely unfounded. He becomes angry and rude for no reason. There is no chemistry between them. Then there is the 'nice guy' Jackson. It doesn't hold up.
The book is repetitive to the point of being condescending to the audience. It states a point, then again, and then a third time in a couple of sentences. Along the lines of - he was short. I couldn't believe how short he was. Looking down on him, because of his height... It made it very tiresome to read.
A dramatic event such as one of the performers needing CPR from Zade is poorly handled. Zade starts CPR, then it jumps to Mac arguing with another guy. Then the woman is being taking away by paramedics!! No description of what is happening, of she revived her or anything.
I tried to give this book a chance but two thirds of it could easily be removed as repetition and still have a story. Not recommended."

(As a note: Handbook was originally written as a screenplay, and I'm positive that the endgame had always been for film. I can't see it because it's in development, but apparently she is slated to play the lead in the movie of this book.)

That's not the best part, though. The best part is that her IMDB says she's JC Chasez from NSYNC's cousin. And all I can say is how dare you put JC's good name to shame like this.

The author believes people are jealous and also blames social media for being removed from the NYT bestsellers. She's also pretending that her book ""outsold everything"" through a comparison to which...I didn't think this situation could get anymore hilarious but it has.

Since the author believes she deserved the spot, even though I hadn't seen many reviews or hype or anything about this book before The Drama, let's take a look at the Amazon sample.

starts off with a weird foreword, where some rando is talking about how to pronounce the author's name. Not kidding.



In the same paragraph, they drop a slur in order to convey just how cool this author is. Apparently this rando and the author met on a Facebook page (they don't explicitly say but it is definitely .) So that explains a lot.

I have no idea why this warranted a foreword, or who the hell Skye Turner is, and I want the 5 minutes it took to read that overly long foreword back.

So now we have chapter 0. Not chapter 1. Apparently the foreword just wasn't enough for pointless explanation of things no one cares about.

Chapter 0 is written in first person POV, so we're stuck in the head of the most inane, boring character ever put to paper. The MC is not normal, and spends quite a lot of time telling us about how not normal she is. She dyes her hair! She likes thunder storms! You need to know this, of course, for the rest of the story to make sense.

And let me tell you, this character, oh man. She wears converse high tops and dyes her hair all kinds of colors. So you know, she's like, totally alternative.

This is literally how she describes herself:



The dialogue is pretty awkward and boring. She fights with her mother about a show or whatever. The classic, ""I'm not you, Dad/Mom/Parent"" deal. There's a huge wall of text that should have split into at least two paragraphs. The descriptions are...weird, to put it lightly.

At the end of the chapter there's a few stanzas of a Dixie Chicks song, because it's the MC's anthem so we need to include the Genius annotated lyrics. Oh, and don't worry, the narrative explains why it's the perfect song for the moment in case you didn't get it from the lyrics.

The narrative likes to do that a lot apparently. Just look at this gem:





Get it? Do you get it? The boy band names are wrong. You know how it's One Direction? Well, he said Five Directions! Just making sure you got the joke. Are you laughing yet?

We even get explanations on nicknames:





First of all, ""around here."" ??? People are nicknamed literally everywhere, this is not some new thing inherent to Vegas magicians. And why is this dialogue? Who the hell cares?

Thank god that's where the sample ends. I didn't even talk about chapter 1 because I honestly skimmed. Apparently the MC made it to Vegas, did some kind of magic trick, and now she's super popular.

I do remember that there's a point where the MC explains how her name is pronounced because it's really complicated and we're just dying to know. Just like in the foreword where some rando explained to us that it's pronounced ""Laannee."" Thanks, that question was just burning in the back of my mind.

I'm not sure how NYT did not investigate beforehand, and only after the backlash did they remove it. The conspiracy theorist in me thinks that maybe the plan all along was to drum up interest with the controversy because people definitely weren't talking about this book before.

Probably because Handbook is actually boring and the only thing interesting about it is the scandal."
Handbook for Mortals,Jerecho,"October 22, 2019",1.0,"I never finish the book and never will.

The first part is a foreword about Lani (pronounce Annie with an L) as if quite literally I can't pronounce it correctly....

Then chapter zero with the Fool...

And then I realized my time is more worthwhile to move on to another book with much more good plot or have a plot in order to have a satisfactory story. Not to mention, grammatical errors...

It's more of the headache it cause rather than the did not finish, so I'm giving it a 1star rating. If you are not convince try the preview or read the reviews."
Handbook for Mortals,J.A. Ironside,"September 19, 2017",1.0,"DNF at 10%

 

You know a book is bad when you can't even finish the free sample. Should I then be writing a review about it? Ordinarily I wouldn't but the author/ publisher of this book decided to pull this ;   so that makes it fair game as far as I'm concerned.

 

""Handbook for Mortals is in development as a motion picture set to debut in 2018.""  For reference fellow bibliophiles, ANYONE can say their book is in development as a motion picture. Literally anyone. It does not mean that it is being made into a motion picture, or that a movie deal is in the works or that the rights have even been optioned. What it means is that the author would like the book to generate a spin off movie and she thinks that using the words 'in development' will help drum up interest. YA author Victoria Aveyard (Red Queen) did the same thing. I doubt we will ever see a movie of this book, let alone soon.

 

So to the book. Well you might be forgiven for thinking the author wrote her own foreword - one which humblebrags to the skies about what a wonderful friend she is, how talented in so many different arenas of the arts - but apparently Skye Turner is a real person, although one without much apparent judgement when it comes to literature. Actually if you can stand it, the foreword is highly entertaining despite being painfully badly written.

 

From the 10% of this book that I managed to drag myself through, this is full of the tropiest of YA troped that ever dreamt of buying their way onto a bestseller list. Now let's be clear a trope in and of itself isn't a bad thing. There is nothing wrong with giving your target audience more of what they want after all. However as a writer you MUST deliver the old desired tropes in a new and engaging way, not just rip off and squash together tropes done successfully by other authors. So here we have the pretty-plain girl with whimsically coloured hair to show what a free spirit she is, a reluctant hero longing for a normal life who has never had a normal day in her life so gods alone know what she is basing her definition of normal on and a love triangle. An actual love triangle where it's two hot guys panting over one incredibly mundane girl. Who has magic. I'm not completely unforgiving to love triangles where it's clear that it's an exploration of character arc, but this would appear to literally be pandering to the fantasy of being desired. The problem with equating desirability with personal value, especially in YA books, has been thoroughly canvassed but in short if this is literally all a character has to offer then they are not complete in and of themselves and that is an increasingly toxic message to be sending out to YA readers. There are other issues here too - basically if anyone cared enough to really read this, I think parts of it would justifiably be called out as problematic.

 

I understand the author has ambitions in the directions of screen writing. I think first she needs to learn how to write dialogue. Or actually just study how to write full stop. 'Brevity is the soul of wit' - so we don't need to hear about a character's hair four times in five paragraphs for example. All in all this is excrement. I'm not surprised underhand measures were taken in an attempt to acquire future sales.

 

Do not recommend."
Handbook for Mortals,Susanna Needs a GREAT Book Please,"August 24, 2017",1.0,"I couldn't help myself, I read the free preview on Amazon.

I don't even know what I just read. How did this trash pile make it to publication? As somebody on twitter said, this sounds like a book you wrote when you were fifteen, hid it from the world, and wrote something better.

This should have stayed hidden from the world.

And how many times did the idiot who wrote the intro have to claim her status as international bestselling romance author? Never heard of her, can't wait to track down some of her stuff and review them honestly. ;)

Avoid this book unless you like bad copies of bad copies of bad copies of bad fan fiction of twilight."
Handbook for Mortals,alittlelifeofmel,"August 25, 2017",,"It's actually ironic that I was talking to one of my best friends Katie the other day and was telling her it made NO SENSE that a book with 9 GR ratings was the #1 NYT bestseller for YA.

I won't say I'll never read this, because I don't know who I'll be in the future, but I can say that I don't really have a ton of respect for this ""author"" and wouldn't actively reach out for anything that has her name attached to it.

Here's the twitter thread if you want to see the person who did all the research I was too lazy to do:"
Handbook for Mortals,Susie,"August 24, 2017",1.0,no thanks. I won't support someone who cheats their way to the top.
Handbook for Mortals,Stephanie,"August 24, 2017",,Nope.
Handbook for Mortals,samantha Bookworm-on-rainydays,"April 10, 2021",1.0,"So I didn't know all the history of this book before I found it at my favorite used bookstore and read it. I saw the cover and read the back, and it sounded fun and interesting, it was even signed by the author ""How awesome!"" I thought. Oh, how wrong I was.


This book was none of those things. It wasn't interesting, it wasn't fun, it was the most boring book about the circus I have ever read in my whole 23 years of life. (I've read The Night Circus and The Ladies of the Secret Circus both 100% better than this) There were I few misspellings here and there which I have never seen in a hardcover book before. (Of course, I can't say anything as the queen of misspellings.) But this felt like a first draft. Like it had been written, looked over once, and then someone hit the publish button, that's how it felt, I wonder if an editor even saw this book.


There was nothing for the reader to get hooked on too, the two love interests read like a glass of warm water on a hot day, boring, kinda gross at first, and very empty feeling. Anyone who reads knows that poor Jack has no chance in hell with the main character, Mac was clearly the Edward of this story, and he was just as creepy at times as Edward but he's not a vampire so it’s harder to get away with it. I mean really? you're watching her get undressed from a crack in the doorway? How romantic.


Now on to the main character Zade, the worlds biggest Mary Sue. I have never minded a Mary Sue really, I think it’s good for a first-time writer to feel like they're in the world they're making, it can really help. But Zade is everything I hate in a Mary sue character. She likes to say how she's not pretty but every guy in the world falls over themselves for her and every women or even teenage girls hate her. The way she tries so hard to be NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS is just gross and weird given she's 25 in the book and the writer is in her 30s. She actually frights with a teenager over her teenage boyfriend. Not to mention she almost kills a biker because he hit her bag out of her hands. Which is not a good way to make the reader like her.


Besides the most boring love triangle in history and a few hints that Zade has magic there was no plot in this 448 page book that should at least be interesting because of the magic right? Nope we see almost no magic at all. When there was something interesting Zade makes sure to skip it or tells you what happened afterwards. She was literally dying at one point in this book but instant of switching point of views to Mac which would have made the most sense Zade tells the reader what happened while she was dying letting us know she lives… After all what's the point of making the reader want to keep reading to find out what happens next. (Eye roll)


The idea that this book got on to the New York bestsellers list even with the cheating is awful not to mention the art being basically stolen makes me happy I got this second hand. (All so there's a weird transphobia at the end of this with a character being called aunt because he dressed in girl clothes as a kid and it’s supposed to be a joke which is just gross)

But the even sadder thing is that 1 this is a great title and 2 It’s a good idea for a story hell a series and movie (Which is what they wanted to make). A witch that joins the circus and has mystery dark magic people after her is interesting, a love triangle can be interesting, this all could have gone different if she had 1. Had more people read this, re-read it herself and re-wrote something's and a good editor piece it together better. 2 Didn't cheat her way on to the bestseller list and didn't copy someone's art so closely. 3. Didn't lie about it when everyone found out about the cheating. You could have said sorry it was wrong, and that you were just new to the book world. But this is what we got in the end, a not very well-written book, a movie that will never happen along with book two and someone who can never come back to the writing world even under another pen-name, and that's probably for the best in the end.

I fancied myself as a hero.
I was going to tell all the 'haters' not to bash a book they have not read because of the questionable practices put into play to push this book to the top of the best sellers list.
Questionable and not 'exactly' proven.
Don't misunderstand me, I don't argue that this should not have been removed from the list. I just wanted to see if the book was possibly a missed opportunity.
I wanted to say ""Give it a chance!""
Instead I must say....



What a piece of crud.

I saw so many people raging about this book that I hopped on Netgalley and requested it tootsweet.
I don't believe I even received a notification that I had been approved? I missed my download date and had to request it from the library! My library doesn't even carry the book! I had to get an inter library loan!

After all this trial and tribulation I was happy to have the book in hand (such a pretty cover
) and started reading right away.


I got 5 pages in and I hated Zade.
She is a carbon copy of the author. I understand this happens but, she seems to put a lot of work into making sure that her reader understands this.
She is told by everyone that she is beautiful but she does not consider herself ''hot girl skinny"" because she does not have a thigh gap (among a few other reasons).



She also puts a lot of effort into making sure that we know when a joke is made and why it is funny.



What she does not put a lot of effort into is setting the stage. She used the lyrics from 'Wide Open Places' in the first chapter. Relying on someone else's work to put passion into your story is LAZY m'dear. (Later she also sings an Amie Mann song 'to' another character. The whole scene had my eyeballs rollin' out of my head.)


I was working on reaching the 100 page mark that I had set for myself before giving up and just barely made it.
I also did something I NEVER EVER DO and I skipped to the end and read the last chapter. I wanted to give it one last chance. One last hope that something good could come from slogging through the mess. Let me tell you. It isn't worth it.
Don't even.




I would never tell someone to stop doing something they love, but seriously.
Get some help, get an editor, stop with the commas, just stop, please, it drove me batty.




Do the work and maybe you will end up on the best seller list yet. But I don't think Zade is going to get you there.

Thank you NetGalley for the opportunity. No outside influences affected my review of this book.

An update to this comment I'd like to add is that fact that the cover was apparently STOLEN from a lesser-known artist. I don't just refuse to support a scammer, I refuse to support a thief.

Handbook for Mortals,Erin the Avid Reader ⚜BFF's with the Cheshire Cat⚜,"December 20, 2018",1.0,"I DNF at 42%...because a book with abominable writing and holding no redeeming value does not deserve my attention when there are millions of other great stories I could be reading instead. Also, I much prefer to support authors who put effort into their stories instead of scam artists like Lani Sarem and this crock publishing house.

Onto my actual critique of the story...I do not know what to say. Most other reviewers have used my words and have put their reviews for this book more eloquently than I could surely do. This book has already received justice about its actual content and the scam that went on behind it to get it to #1 on the NY Times Bestseller list, so I'm not going to rant about that.

However. just recently, I have been hearing more and more and about this ""novel"" being adapted into a film, and the author playing the main bitc--I mean, ""character"". Just to let you all know, this will not be adapted into a movie. Because of the scam that went on behind this book, because of the author blatantly lying about their not being a scam despite the obvious evidence that this book was bulk-bought and not stocked at chain book retailers so it could be on the top of the NY bestselling list DESPITE no one hearing about it before, and because the writing of this trite is so ungodly horrible and the characters so detestable and boring, this will surely NOT be adapted into a film.

Onto the story itself...its truly abhorrent. I wholeheartedly believe this is a self-insert fanfiction where Sarem is the main character. The character in the book is conveniently described as looking like the author (google her photo and you'll see her), she's overpowered as hell and is immediately liked by everyone despite being pretty damn bland, and the fact that Sarem is talking bout starring as the main character in the ""upcoming movie"" makes me think that it was simply the author fawning over herself while creating a shitty Fantasy backdrop to get her book to sell.

I cannot recommend this book to anyone. I did not find this book entertaining on how awful it was. If I wanted to read something like that, I'd go onto Fanficiton.net and reread , in which there's a budding theory online that Sarem actually that Fanfic. I am not kidding. You can google that, too if you've got nothing better to do...but I'd much rather you find a good book instead."
Handbook for Mortals,Evan Clark,"August 25, 2017",1.0,"It's not my usual jam to rate something based on controversy, even if the stir behind this one is particularly odious (if you're that curious, just Google the title and hit news.

1) The cover art is blatantly derivative of a far superior work by Gill Del Mace, to the point of intellectual property infringement. Either that dude is seeing some royalties or someone is going to get the living shit sued out of them.

2) The first third of the sample is a ranty-gushy forward of the author's fantabulous exploits, given by a super-duper close friend. None of this actually describes the book or makes note of its origins. It does mention how great a movie it will be someday, though for more information on that, you'll have to do the Google search thing.

Handbook for Mortals,Myth,"April 3, 2020",1.0,"I'm on a roll this year with books I don't hate but also aren't good.

So here's the thing. If a fourteen year old had written this self-insert fanfiction and posted it on ffnet, I would be proud of her for finishing something and encourage her to continue in her writing endeavors. That's how this reads. From a fourteen year old posting for fun and not money, this is cute.

For an adult person to not only try to sell this but to fraudulently present it as NY Times bestselling qualified is delusional. You can see in the comments that I don't think the author had anything against Thug in particular (the book this author knocked off the top spot by knowingly and purposefully fake-mass-purchasing books from stores that the NY Times uses to calculate bestsellers), but rather something against the idea that her book wouldn't be special in some way. Now she markets the book as a 23-hour bestseller or whatever, and, okay.

Often my reviews focus on one aspect of a book, whether it's structure, the prevalence of explicit sex scenes in YA, the prevalence of violence and abuse in YA linked directly to sex, prologues, the responsibility of authors to try not to push a terrible agenda, the fate of women in YA, etc. This review is going to talk about the marketing of this book, as marketing and strategic communication are what I'm currently getting a degree in (fingers crossed for May graduation y'all even if I don't get a commencement because of the global pandemic wooooo).

The marketing of this book as a 23 hours bestseller is kind of genius. Don't get me wrong, it's misleading as hell, insulting to everyone involved, and edging into ethically unsound (did the author, who I know has managed bands amongst other things, never have to take the shitton of ethics and media law classes I had to sit through?) but it's kind of genius. It's called spin, and it takes something negative and makes it a curiosity rather than an outright terrible thing. By rebranding herself as a 23 hour bestseller, the author has a role no one else has, subtly casts shade at the NYT list, and catches your attention. Basically stealing the cover art? A shitton of press that she wouldn't have gotten from just having a bad book. Constantly talking about how it's going to be a movie (with the author in the starring role)? People like movie adaptations. Letting it be known that Jackson Milsap is a not at all disguised Jackson Rathbone? The author of this book may be delusional, but she knows how to market, and I am half convinced that some of this was done entirely on purpose to get attention.

And now back to the book! 'Delusional' is a term I'm tossing around a lot in this review, and I want to clarify that I don't just mean apparently believing she wrote a book professional enough to be published. I mean There are a whole lot of scenes that I am half convinced technically happened to the author irl, just tilted subtly differently and incorrectly. People (Jackson) asking her to go to music shows after she expresses a lot of interest? Probably happened. People (Jackson) saying they'll have to hear her play sometime after she goes on and on about playing guitar? Probably happened. People (Jackson) asking her to go places with a group? Probably happened, especially since she was his band's manager for a time.

But all of this filtered through the lens of the author (sorry, Zade) becomes an eternal assurance by the narrative and the author/Zade herself that people (Jackson) want her to go personally. They (Jackson) really do want to hear her play, and desperately. They (Jackson) really want to spend time with her, and are just using the group as an excuse. It's kind of uncomfortable to read, and it got more uncomfortable the more I read about the circumstances surrounding the book and the author.

I genuinely hope Clark Kent the technician is a figment of the author's imagination, because I would hate to be the guy he might be based on irl."
Handbook for Mortals,J.S. Frankel,"August 27, 2017",1.0,"I managed to read a few pages on Amazon and decided it wasn't for me. The forward was badly written and edited, IMO; that was enough to make me suspicious. Okay, so not all forwards can be works of literary art. Moving on and going to the opening chapter, I thought it would be better.

I was wrong. It opened with basically mucho paragraphs of description and teen angst, very little dialogue. That was enough to make me think this wasn't going to be good, not only because of the wall of text that faced me, but also because of the tropes tossed in by the author. The handsome older man. The snotty girlfriend. The...never mind--by the time something happened I'd already lost interest.

Most of all, though, I cannot understand the buzz about a book that--if the allegations are true--essentially scammed its way to the top. It wasn't THE worst thing I've ever read, but it surely didn't rank even close to the best of what I've read. If this report by pajiba dot com bears out, then that makes me weep for the publishing industry in general, and also for the writers out there who don't game the system. By the way, I am one of those writers, and this kind of news really bothers me.

I really want to be wrong about this book, but I don't think it's worth reading--for me. Can't and won't speak for anyone else."

Handbook for Mortals,Samantha Uy,"November 14, 2017",1.0,"I seriously wonder at people who rate this book anything better than a 3 star. I mean 3 stars, I can get behind, to each their own. But the utter lack of plot, comprehension, cohesiveness and grammar makes me wonder if any of the people who tout this book as great has ever read an actual good book. Even if you didn't know about the book, the utter reprehensiveness of the main character Zade (duh, it's actually the author) and the misogyny... it's all disgusting.

You barely even see any magic in this book. It's barely fantasy. It's just a romance book that happens to have some magic element to it. IF you ever see this in the bookstore (thank god I've NEVER seen this in any of the bookstores in my city), then just walk on by.

I suggest The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas instead."
Handbook for Mortals,MissLaurie,"November 15, 2017",1.0,"Before I start, YES, I have read the whole book. And it was such a torture to read, I had to step away a lot just to keep calm. And YES, I know about the scandal and like most, normal people, I'm annoyed at what they did, frustrated at their continued lying about the facts, and their refusal to own up when they've already been caught. But NO, that didn't color this review, so I won't talk about that from here on in. This is all on the merits of the book (spoiler, it has none).

First off, this thing has no plot, aside from the love triangle. The author will tell you that there is-- it's about magic (with a k!) and chasing your dreams. But the things is, the author is always telling us things and not actually showing us anything. For a good majority of this book, you'll have to slog through Zani debating which boy she likes better and creating drama for herself deciding... you guessed it, which boy she likes better. You barely even see any ""magick"" here and most of the time, when you do, it's Zade using it to attack other people. And she says the other girls are bitches? Right.

Second, as I've touched above, the author doesn't seem to know the concept of show don't tell. But more than that, the author seems to think the readers are stupid. I have lost count of how many times she explained things over and over again as if any reader wouldn't be familiar with a stage, or a weather, or even how a joke works. And it's not just the repetition, it's the circularity of the explanations. You can really see where the author just padded the original screenplay she had so it can be made into a novel.

Third, the grammar... I just have no words. This book apparently had three editors. THREE! But either that's a lie or they didn't do their job... or you know, they're just as bad and caught nothing. This book is rife with grammatical errors, uses punctuation wrong consistently, and continuity errors. Like the author changed something halfway but forgot to edit the parts leading up to the part she changed. It's just stupid.

Fourth, in the author's desire to be the only girl that matters in the story, any girl that isn't Zani becomes either a slutty bitch or a mousy, background character. Seriously. Zani judges other women all the time. For Zani, every other girl is a dumb bimbo and she is the only one above it all. The underlying misogyny is staggering and disgusting. Not harping on the whole Not That Kind of Girl TM trope, but this could seriously have been done better. So much better.

In conclusion, you're better off just following the chapter by chapter summaries from online bloggers. They're hilarious, intellectually stimulating, and they're just summaries so there's also the added bonus that your brain won't leak out of your ears from continued reading of Handbook for Mortals. I would give this a zero if I could.

P.S. Don't listen to the people saying that a lot of the one star reviewers didn't read this book. I'm looking at you Lani Sarem, John Rap, and friends. A lot of these reviewers struggled through the book. And for those who only read the free sample from Amazon... so what? Publishers will only read the first few chapters before they decide whether they like a book or not. That those people couldn't even stomach the Foreword, the laughable ""Chapter 0"", and Chapter 1 and 2, well then THAT'S really telling!

Authors vs. Goodreads,karen,"June 19, 2018",,"i assume this book was written solely to get a reaction out of people; to prove some sort of point about how naughty goodreaders will gang up and troll-attack a problematic book with ""nonreviews"" and ""abuse,"" and it certainly has had caused a stir. however, there is just so much misinformation in this book, and it is so insulting to goodreaders - to people who have long used this place as a little booknerd refuge where they can make friends and talk books and do their own thing without bullshit, that i feel obligated to address some of the accusations and assumptions not as a ""pampered reader,"" as desh claims we are, but purely as someone confronted with inaccurate information setting the facts straight for anyone foolish enough to consider this book in any way a fair assessment of what goodreads is and how it functions.

here's some stuff about me: i do not work for goodreads, but i have been an active member since 2007 when goodreads launched. i write reviews, i am a goodreads librarian, and i have had many interactions on here with authors, 99% of which have been positive. i have seen goodreads go through many waves. i have seen bad behavior from authors and reviewers alike. i have generally opted to stay out of the fray when it occurs because i just don't have time for conflict, but i have certainly observed it from the sidelines. and yet somehow i made the stgr bullies page because of a single one-star review i wrote that pissed someone off. considering i have 3562 ratings, and written 1850 reviews, where only 19 of them have been one-star reviews, giving me an average rating of 3.79, it's pretty clear that i am not a bully or a troll; i am just a person who didn't like a book. but i don't hold goodreads responsible. they aren't to blame for one person being a dick. and they aren't responsible for many of the conflicts that have occurred on here. i'm not stating all this to pat myself on the back for being such a good person, just to illustrate that sometimes, shit just happens. and you deal with it. this book reads like someone who had a negative experience on goodreads and decided to go off on an uninformed tear about something they don't quite understand, fueled by emotional outrage and wounded pride. and that's fine - that is one way to respond to life's setbacks, but arguments are weakened by specious claims, and that's where i come in.

since i am permitted by the book itself to use , i will take advantage of this. ""brief"" is a matter of opinion.

this booklet makes a lot of broad statements that may be accurate in terms of the author's own experiences here, of which i do not know the specifics, but they are certainly not representative of the general climate of goodreads that i have witnessed firsthand for years. for example:



this is one of those provocative statements of which desh is so fond but do not hold up under any kind of scrutiny. many authors have used goodreads to develop positive relationships with their readers. i know this for a fact because some of those relationships have been with me.



yes. this is true. your book will end up on goodreads if you write it and offer it publicly for people to read - for sale or for free. goodreads is a social cataloging website and the objects it catalogs are books. the other part is trickier. yes, people can ""review"" a book before they have read it, which has caused uproar in many corners, not just from authors. some people use that space to express excitement that a book is coming out that they are looking forward to. or to put a link to a professional review or a booklist that the book is on as a note-to-self about why they were interested in it. or for whatever purpose they choose, within the goodreads TOS: , most specifically:



no one is getting paid to write reviews on goodreads. members have historically thought of the review space as ""theirs"" to decorate any way they see fit. but there have been plenty of review-deletions - sometimes appropriately and sometimes overzealously. desh seems to think that the review space is this inviolable place where reviewers go to ruin lives, and that's just not true.



yes. because that's what a book cataloging site does. it catalogs books. why on earth would they contact every author for every book they add? shakespeare doesn't have the time to answer emails every time a new edition of is published. desh also has a tendency to refer to librarians as ""they,"" as though librarians are working in tandem or have any idea what other librarians are doing at any time. this not entirely accurate. i am a librarian, but i never go to the librarian group or have any contact with other librarians. if i see something that needs fixing, i fix it. there's not some secret cabal where librarians gang up to screw over indie authors. that i know of.

desh cites a single example of a librarian error:



i will take you up on that bet. and i will win. if a book is incorrectly attributed to an author, it is the work of one individual, and it is easy enough to fix (and apparently has been fixed in this case). there's no agenda there - it's an accident. it happens.



every author has an author page. it's so you can see all of the works by the author in one place, and get some brief autobiographical information about them. it does not have to be set up by a publisher or maintained by an author. brian cox does have an author page. so does herman melville. so does mary shelley. and i guarantee you, they do not know. there is a difference between an author page and a author page. goodreads authors maintain their own pages. authors without the goodreads author badge do not.

the author is very paranoid about amazon, and this leads to even more incorrect assertions. it's no secret that i work for barnes and noble, so there's no love lost between me and amazon, but there is some real tinfoil hat talk here. desh warns against giving too much information on your author page here on goodreads because



but if your book isn't available on amazon, as this author's is not, what possible sinister purpose can they achieve by having the information? and even if it is available on amazon - what's the harm of their having information that you yourself control? this is how publishing works for a self-pubbed author: you write a book. you choose a cover. you write up the book description. you try to sell it - on amazon, on barnes and noble, on smashwords. wherever. what you write in the description is what potential readers see, and what the site selling your book see. amazon and other retail outlets offer the book for sale, hoping to make money. goodreads adds the book to their database for readers to discover. there's nothing diabolical here, and even though i know amazon has not always treated its authors carefully, there is nothing dangerous to them having the very basic information you have supplied. they cannot sell something you have not made available to sell.



well, except for HERE, in the goodreads feedback group:



yes, amazon bought goodreads in 2013. they also own audible, shelfari, toby press, zappo, etc etc etc. they have a lot of fingers in a lot of pies. but they haven't taken over the site, they way many people feared back when the announcement was made. the goodreads staff is still its own thing, apart from the monster staff of amazon. but that is lost on him as he rants about goodreads and amazon as though they are the same beast.



i turn that back on the author - what IS ironic about this?? i take the subway train to work every day. and frequently, something is fixed and then - you know what?? it breaks again. this is not ironic, it is just the price of living in the world.





the goodreads staff can be found here:

there are 87 of 'em. and there are thirty million members. you do the math. sometimes things are going to be bumpy.

the paranoia continues.



yes. this site was set up as a site for readers. their ""about us:""



author involvement can be a nice perk, but this has always been first and foremost a haven for readers.



free information?? why should goodreads pay authors for information about their books?? as an author you should be grateful for the FREE EXPOSURE goodreads offers. it gets your book in front of potentially thirty million readers. and again, if you aren't selling your book on amazon, why would they give a shit about your information? i have, just from living in the world, acquired a lot of free information about kim kardashian's butt. but i can't anything with that information. i can't sell her butt because she has not made her butt available to me. you see?







how is that shocking? this is a service they offer to authors that readers who do not write have no use for. it's author-centric because it is a service for authors. it has no negative impact on a reader, so it doesn't go against the ""public persona."" it's just something else they do in addition to being a place for readers .



this is not necessarily contempt. it might just be caution. some people aren't comfortable writing about books with the author peering over their shoulder and i don't think that's a bad thing. it's difficult to speak freely when you have to worry that an author will get their feelings hurt if someone didn't like the book. and some authors get aggressive or passive-aggressive, which is worse, and it's just a headache some people want to avoid. an unwillingness to invite conflict shouldn't be interpreted as hostile. i have had many authors comment on my reviews and it has nearly always been pleasant, but others have not been so fortunate.

desh keeps going on about how bad the goodreads librarians are. this author clearly had a negative experience with a single librarian, and has translated this experience into some sort of site-wide phenomenon blown all out of proportion.



well, this oughtta be good. i would love to know what kind of power i have. incidentally, the goodreads librarian group is not some hidden elite portal. it can be visited by any member, even if they are not themselves a librarian:





this is a touch hyperbolic. also, i would venture that paid staff trumps librarians. again, i need to emphasize that nearly all of my dealings with authors have been positive. like attracts like: if you behave like an asshole, you will be treated like an asshole. i have had way more bullshit from other users than from authors.

but back to librarians.

librarians

we DO? like a bat signal?? i'm pretty sure that every member of goodreads has access to the goodreads feedback group, or can email most of the staff members. and yes, edits can be made to the book description page, but i have never seen any evidence of librarians going buckwild, adding incorrect descriptions just for giggles. and if it does happen, you better believe some sour-faced librarian will correct it and administer a scolding. librarians don't mess around.



incorrect on a number of levels.

again, it must be stressed that amazon only acquired goodreads in 2013. the mission statement that the site is for readers predates that arrangement. and reviewers have reviews removed ALL THE TIME. you gotta visit that feedback group more, friend, read some complaints from reviewers. reviewers are always complaining about being treated unfairly. perspective - it's all about where you're standing.



again, if your books aren't for sale on amazon, which you have previously stated, they can't profit from your information, so why fret? and what benefit does amazon receive from trolls?? because your wording makes it sound like the reason they offer free books is so trolls can have them. and GASP - goodreads offers advertising space in return for money?? THOSE MONSTERS!!

again - this is how the world works. you think highway billboards are free?



this is called internet safety 101. there is no incentive to readers in giving out personal information. a goodreads author is able to tailor their profile page in a way that will let potential readers know who they are, and a sort of glimpse into what they can expect from their work. it's basically more advertising space - to attract readers. regular users aren't selling anything, so they don't have to share any personal information.



is it surprising?? that people don't want strangers pawing through their information?? privacy settings are pretty standard, no matter what site you're talking about. not everyone wants to let stranger-danger in. this is just sensible practice. there are so many different reasons people use goodreads, and not all of them involve socializing. goodreads is an excellent resource to find books, and to track your own reading. and no one needs to know about you if you're only here for your own private archiving. there are about 50 valid reasons for making your profile private or limiting the amount of information you give out, as a reader. for an author, who is essentially selling themselves, providing personal background is useful, and in traditional publishing situations, is one to which an entire department is assigned.

Authors vs. Goodreads,Rose,"January 19, 2015",1.0,"Quick review for a very quick read.

Never in the five years I've been a member on this site have I read such a prejudiced, ignorant narrative on the Goodreads community and being a part of it. It's interesting, because I just read an article in ""Writer's Digest"" talking about marketing on the Goodreads community for this past month (January), and one of the things they were talking about for aspiring authors is using your presence as a reader chiefly on the community.

Because that's what this community is: a reader community - to discuss books and opinions about books. As well, it's a book cataloguing site - meant for members to keep track of their personal shelves, books they have interests in and even those they do not.

I don't know who Zoe Desh is (and the term is pseudonymous, not anonymous in the author's case), but the only thing I have to say is that if she feels the need to paint the entire reading community of Goodreads with a wide brush without so much of a thought to the colorful opinions and expansive range of readers that are members of this community, then she's the one missing out.

Two cents, and none further."
Authors vs. Goodreads,Carmen,"April 29, 2015",1.0,"Desh is very upset because she got some bad reviews and does not feel like the world has appreciated her masterpiece(s). She feels persecuted. Everyone is out to get her. It is not that her book was bad, and people didn't enjoy it, it is that Goodreads is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, full of corrupt faceless suits who run it, and bitchy out-to-get-you GR librarians who are corrupt and unfair. I feel sympathy for her - I really do. It is hard to accept that perhaps your writing craft does need work and that people don't instantly worship you and your creation. I'm not even being sarcastic, it really is hard, and I really am sorry that she got her feelings so hurt.

But I think Desh is a little confused about life. And Goodreads. When you publish your work, some people aren't going to like it. Desh seems to think that one-star reviews are not indicative of someone her work, but instead a form of bullying or persecution. She assumes that people who didn't like her book didn't read it. Or are trying to ""skew their stats"" or something. She advises authors to ""fight back!"" by PMing her and she will instantly give them a five star review without even reading their book. Hmmmmm. Fighting fire with fire?

Desh also wants this to stop being a social media site (for readers - she is fine with and even encourages authors to ""meet,"" network, and chat through GR). She hates that a ""like"" button exists on reviews, and she thinks the comments section underneath reviews should be eliminated. She calls it ""gossip,"" and sneers at it because her experiences with the comments section have been very negative. She also hates gifs, and seems to see them as some sort of abomination - probably because they are often used to capture a reviewer's feelings about a book (not always negatively, but in her experience, yes, always negatively).

She is obviously not a fan of honesty - but instead favors the ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" view of ""we are fellow authors - unite!"" reviewing. So she is not giving anyone negative reviews, but instead, boosting her fellow authors with her automatic 5-stars. Somehow she believes this ""Everyone will get 4 and 5 star reviews on everything!"" will somehow make GR a better place. (Not a very honest or effective one, though.)

Life (and Goodreads) is not always kind. You are not owed anything! Especially not by readers who paid money for your work. I know Desh put hard work, sweat, tears, and blood into whatever it is that she wrote. I'm sorry that the world was brutal in its response, but... that's life sometimes. Being an author is very difficult. I would advise her to keep working on and improving her writing. Or, if she really thinks she deserves only praise and gentleness, to perhaps only sell/give books to friends and family. You can be quite the little celebrity in your own circle! Don't let GR get you down, Desh. Life has so much more to offer.

So, here is my very authentic review and no, I don't consider it as harassment.



*whiny voice* Where's my fucking cookie? I deserve one and some brain bleach to top it all off. And, when the author can mention numerous times ""wouldn't-pee-on-it-if-it-was-on-fire"" shelf and all those derogatory dancing gifs, then I must categorically insist that Charlie would not be amused being called derogatory. BTW, he doesn't dance in those gifs. *makes frowny face*

Whoa. I'd say someone did the independent authors, known as Indie authors, a huge disservice. And, established authors would be well advised to give this piece of rubbish a very wide berth.

Yep, best known as the darkest recesses of the mind.

Flawed Review System. Who knew?

Baba: Maybe we should start searching for alternatives in the outer space, then.

I know that Goodreads isn't the perfect site and I especially dislike the concept of rating books. But otherwise I do enjoy being a member of GR, reviewing and chatting books with fellow book lovers.









Ouch. How many DNFs did I have last year? *scratches head* Objection, Your Honor! That will never do! Sustained. You may keep on reviewing books that you've abandoned, Baba.

I swear I ain't even mad. After all, I got some good laughs out of it…but wait a second. The following bull gave me real whiplash:



Judgmental, much?



You know I'm actually living in a progressive and democratic country. Yet I'm not sure if government wouldn't frown upon smut. So what?? I'm sure everybody--even those who've been called derogatorily ""foreigners""--have seen a dick already.






Uh-huh. Isn't that derogatory? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.



Since I read and reviewed this worthless booklet and invested a huge amount of my fucking time, I want you to stroke my ego. It's the least anyone can do and I fucking it! Thank you. BTW, I enjoyed using filthy language. That's another form of stroking my ego. *purrs*

I've spent five years on this website and mostly only seen a positive image of companionship and goodwill.

Gaddis, M., Dolores, Proustitute, Steve, Stephen (and all the variations of our awesome name), Finnuala, Karen, Renato, Annie, Kenny, the list is too long to complete without insult and I'm only stopping here because I'm drunk on insult and booze and want to get back to my point, and these are people whom I to give me honest opinions about books. These are people that direct my 'buy now' clicking. These are people who have shown more academia in their reviews that my time spent in college classrooms. Goodreads is a wealth of knowledge and if you disagree then you are probably looking in the wrong places. If my giving 5 stars to Proust was trolling than goddammit I better give up reading. But seriously, Zoe, stop protecting authors just because they are authors and start protecting language and integrity. If the authors you are defending were worth a damn, then people probably wouldn't write negative reviews about them. Let's face it, not everyone gets to be a genius. I'd love to be a respected author but that isn't in the cards for me and we shouldn't sugarcoat reviews of every book that sees print. David Foster Wallace warned against such things, saying we should write for ourselves and not for the critics. I hate to say it, but some books are terrible. It happens. And it can be a great learning experience. I've been told I suck at writing plenty of times, but I keep at it because it is important to me. I just read an essay by Charles Simic in which he talked about all the times he was told his writing was terrible, but he didn't cry or dismiss his critics as unworthy trolls but went back home with their criticism in his heart and tried again. Come back when we goodreaders insult the Ulysses of the modern day and I'll apologize on behalf of humanity. Until then, fuck you. Stop trolling the internet with your garbage."

* Remove the Comments section along with the like button from reviews. If Goodreads is going to treat the 'Review' as a literary work worthy of its own review, there should have been a Dislike button.



Another reason the Comments section should be abolished is because it is only there for the people who 'like' the review, especially considering the author dare not say anything to a reviewer. The comments appear to be there for stroking the ego of the reviewer and

Authors vs. Goodreads,Manny,"August 11, 2015",,"[People can talk of nothing else! (Charlie Hebdo is so last week). While discussing these weighty matters with Nandakishore, Traveller and others earlier today, I believe I came across a complete and effective solution to the urgent problems described by Mr. Desh. Fearful that my penetrating insights may languish forever unnoticed in Nandakishore's thread, I take the liberty of reproducing them here. I began by expressing my deepest sympathy with Mr. Desh's position.]

I feel the author's pain! Why, only the other day, a person well known on this site, whose name starts with an A, went and one-starred all my books. I am virtually sure he hasn't read them - well, not cover to cover anyway. But how to prove it?

Naturally, I have done what I could. The people at Lulu, CSLI Press and Cambridge University Press were very helpful about linking recent sales to credit card numbers, and it seems that someone in Egypt did indeed buy all four books. It can't be a coincidence. But has he read them? ? I have made up questionnaires for each book and asked the publishers to forward them to Mr A. If he does not answer within fifteen working days, he will no longer be allowed to shop on their sites. I asked if they could bring criminal proceedings against him, but apparently that's not possible. I don't quite understand why. I am not satisfied, no, not by any means.



It's the only solution. I think as few as 50 multiple-choice questions would be enough to weed out the impostors.

But... wait. These people are so devilishly cunning. They'll probably share the answers between themselves, and then be able to pose as having read the book when in fact they've done nothing of the kind. Multiple choice won't work. The only solution is for every reviewer to write a lengthy essay about the book (we need a technical term here, but I can't think of a good one - anyway, never mind). They will post their essay where the author can mark it and decide if they have understood the book or not. People who have not understood it will not be allowed to post, and will be expelled from the site if they repeat the offense.

This seems fair, don't you think?



Hm... that might be enough. But how can the author be sure that the multiple choice examples are tough enough, if they constantly keep changing? The rogue reviewers will keep generating them until they get an easy one, and then, zap! More review chaos.

I tell you, you have to learn to think like them. They are fiendishly ingenious.



Three strikes and you're out. I like it.

Maybe the second and third attempts can be done on a pay-per-view basis. I mean, if you're bidding to review someone's book and you've already cast doubt over your credentials by failing the test, it's only fair to ask you to show good faith. $10 would be enough. It could be split evenly between Goodreads and the author.



Oh, but wait! We're so naive. They'll just open a new account and get in that way.

We need to restrict creation of new accounts. You have to give passport and bank account details, plus three witnesses who are already members and can be held legally responsible if the information turns out to be incorrect. I mean, it's fraud and it should be treated as such. Right?



Okay, here's another try. When you've passed the test and written your review, you also have to post a $1000 bond as a guarantee that the review is serious and accurate. I mean, if you've passed, that shows you're able to do it, and if you haven't then you're just messing around. The author is allowed to complain about reviews that are not up to standard, and if the reviewer disagrees it goes to a mediation panel which is half authors and half reviewers. And again, if the review is found wanting then half the bond goes to Goodreads and half to the author. If no one posts a complaint within thirty days, you get your bond back and the review is permanently greenlighted.

It may seem a bit complicated, but I feel that after a while people would see the merits of the system. Don't you agree?"

After all, how can you not feel so bad about a poor wannabe underappreciated crusader taking on a 'noble' quest against those vicious readers who dare to have opinions instead of just being an obedient herd ready to be marketed at and ready to obediently sing dithyrambs to any half-baked 'creative' effort that is given to them to 'consume'!

Not to forget the apparently all-menacing shadowy figure of that 'bullies' our poor crusader. Makes me think of Terry Pratchett's badass , who won't let anyone get away with any bullshit.
Since apparently Goodreads is ruled by the power of the Librarian, I assume it essentially makes it the equivalent of the library. So I will quote Sir Terry Pratchett (since it's pointless to quote this... ahem... 'booklet'):

Authors vs. Goodreads,Jane,"January 20, 2015",1.0,"Where I got the book: free download from a retail platform.

This odd little document came across my radar, and I downloaded it hoping it might be a cogent roundup of the author side of the current, very regrettable polarization of the reading world. I should have known better. It is, alas, a sad little rant, with enough baiting of Goodreads reviewers to ensure it’ll earn its day in the spotlight. If you’re an author looking for information about how to thrive on Goodreads, I would advise you to steer clear of this mess of misinformation and grudges and keep looking—there are a couple of more serious attempts out there at guiding authors around the Goodreads site.

The key to this booklet can be found at the end, where the Author’s Notes reveal that



And there you have it. An ejected porn author (male, by the way, in case you’re wondering about the pronoun) has figured out a way to get back on Goodreads and work out his resentment at the same time. The huge irony of this grudge-fest is that the author claims to not want to be on Goodreads at all: Not if they publish, say, via a pdf that they sell on their own website. But then the author would miss out on his chance to have a go at the Goodreads community and get the attention he clearly so desperately wants.

I’m not going to bother refuting the tired old tales about Goodreads bullies, which are scattered with a few links to other grudge-bearers and a discredited anti-Goodreads site. Authors wondering about Goodreads would be well advised to spend a few months on the site as readers, and judge for themselves, looking at the whole context.

This author’s “valid reasons for wanting to be on Goodreads” are:








Take it from me, this is terrible advice. The only reason an author should really want to be on Goodreads is that they love books and would like to discuss them with other readers. Many authors do this successfully and end up with Goodreads friends who may even become fans. Facebook and Twitter are far better places to network with other authors and ask questions of each other.

There are other chunks of misinformation designed to scare authors away from Goodreads and prove the odd claim that For example, that Goodreads has no right to display your book cover and description. Yes, they do. You put those things up yourself on a publishing platform and agree to their terms of service—which generally state they have the right to use the book information you put up there (but not the contents) as they wish. Or you don’t own the cover and book description at all, because you signed away your rights to your publisher. None of this has anything to do with Goodreads.

Or how about the scare tactic of posting Goodreads’ License Grant clause and claiming that gives Goodreads the rights to your book? Um, no. Goodreads grabs the rights to reviews, comments and any of your writing you might post directly onto the site, but it doesn’t assert any claim over books published on other platforms. Far from being “legalese gobbledygook” as the author claims, the Goodreads TOS is clearly written.

In the end, this book isn’t really about giving authors good advice. It’s a rather pathetic attempt to scare them away from Goodreads, and gives them absolutely nothing useful on either the positive or the negative side. Goodreads definitely isn’t a paradise for all authors and a well-balanced account of its negative sides would be a useful way of helping authors think through whether they really want to be active on the site, or focus their efforts elsewhere. Unfortunately, this rant is neither balanced nor informative, and is best ignored.

Tellingly, at the end the author invites you to his website “which will be updated as the drama unfolds.” I think we’ll see a few more pokes at the Goodreads community over the coming months, as authors figure out that this tactic gets their name all over Twitter for a day or two and hey, bad publicity’s still publicity, right? If you’re desperate, I suppose it might be."

This pamphlet was written in response to the author getting excommunicated from Goodreads after ""getting uppity with a Librarian while trying to get around a broken feature on the Goodreads website that affected sales of my smut.""

At first, I thought this was written because of some sort of incident between the author and a pack of reviewers. And it surely started out with plenty of warnings about the pitfalls for Indie authors here on Goodreads.


Hmmm. I'm guessing that may be because Indie authors can sometimes be a little more easily hurt by reviewers than the more insulated authors with a publishing house behind them. Some of those hurt authors can lash out at reviewers.
Or publish pamphlets saying things like this:

WTF? Did I misunderstand something? Does this author honestly want Goodreads to turn into Scooby-Doo, and form some sort of Mystery Inc. to ferret out every person who claims to have read a book...but ?!
Oh no! I'll have to fess up to the fact that I skimmed the last part of Persuasion!
Luckily, Ms. Desh does have another idea for the 1 star troll.

I don't think trolling reviews or authors is a very nice thing to do.
However.
I'm pretty sure handing out stars isn't going to make the problem go away.

By the end though, it seems that Ms. Desh is just really angry and frustrated by happened. It appears as though she had a horrible experience trying to navigate broken links and unclear rules. She also apparently wants to warn other Indie authors that Goodreads and Amazon are out to make a buck...at the author's expense. Reviewers are untouchable because they are , and Librarians are Gods because they are...well, for Goodreads.
The majority of the vitriol seems to be aimed at Goodreads for her as an author, and acting like the money-grubbing subsidiary of Amazon that it is. I'm betting there's a grain of truth in what she's saying, even if it's only one side of the story. If you're an Indie author, it probably be a good idea to read over the Rules of Engagement for this site. And it's always a good idea to make sure you're getting a good deal, so look into all the different ways to market your book before you settle on Amazon.
Sure, she sounded like she was spiteful and slightly unhinged, but since I've never tried to interact with Goodreads as an author, I have no idea if anything she's saying is true or not.

I know the author doesn't like GIF-filled reviews, but maybe this will make her smile?"

In the end the only thing we have is time. We arrive on time, we are late, we don’t have time, we prefer doing this or that in our free time, you have cancer-how much time left I have?, I have to wait-how long will it take?, please don’t waste my time, oh my God it was about time!

And I’m sorry but we don’t have time for everything, we have to choose in which we invest our time.

Time time time time time.

Time is like bread, keep it for tomorrow.

You have no idea how much time I save since being in GR. My whole time is studying so I’d be a total loser if I wasted my free time on stupid things. I think everybody thinks that: “I don’t have the time, I have to work/study/take care of kids/blablabla”. No. We don’t like wasting our precious little time. Since I’ve been in GR my time has been multiplied. Or it’s better to say that I make the most of it. Oh yeah, I don’t read that much because I spend lots of time in GR but I don’t see it as a waste but as an investment, ‘cause you are too great to be considered other thing than being worth it.

But wasting time is an idiocy. And I hate it. Everybody hates it.

I learnt so much about GR with this gem! Things that took months of understanding were summarized in few pages. But then add tons of bitterness and prejudices and hate and you’ll have a different sort of omelette. I read it like some kind of study about the human intelligence. If you have the time (or choose to invest your time in this shit) then I advise you to enjoy it. It’s really interesting to hear about other people’s opinions.

You know? There was a place this author would consider heaven. It was Spanish and about the romance genre, so of course not as popular as this website is. The owners only showed long reviews that were filtered by themselves. You could only comment under them if you had read said book, so no gossip was possible. And publishing houses paid them in order to have their books rated with 4 or 5 stars. Of course, that meant not all of them did so. In the end, certain books were all 4-5 rated, with no exception. And in the forum “useless” comments or negative reviews about the books amongst the “clients” were erased. They even read your PM and if you ever talked about a website different to their own, you were automatically expelled. And you know what? That place sucked. We used to call them the Nazis.

I think that author would have loved that place with all his heart. Oh, I forgot, it used the Spanish language! And he says that countries that are small and can’t afford a computer are worthless. The government would frown upon me if I sent a letter to my president telling him I love reading M/M? Mmmm, yes, I think they would. Apparently that’s enough to discredit someone’s opinion. Yes, because in Spain we still paint bulls on our cave walls. Welcome to Altamira, my friends. I envy you so much, North Americans!

One thing the author is not aware of is that this place is made by and for readers. Of course readers rule here, that’s the reason of it all. We are not here to “stroke the author’s ego”. We are here to find good books, give our feedback as an exchange if we feel like it (not as an duty, because this is relax and diversion, not homework), or to just have fun with people with the same tastes (or not) that you would probably never get to know in real life (I wish!), and keep track of news and your book list (with those you read or want to read and even those we don’t want to but add anyway in order not to buy them because there are so many books out there we would end up nuts).

We are not professional reviewers. Well, most of us are not. We don’t serve authors, we are not slaves. We are real people with normal jobs and ordinary lives. I prefer trusting a person like me in these topics, people who have some kind of criteria. I prefer a person who is real and is not content with every shining thing that comes out of the oven and one from whom suddenly a 5-star review appears in my Home page, because that’s when I know I have to REALLY consider reading that book.

I prefer someone telling me crystal clear “This book is shit” than a fancy creature comparing Kafka and Spanish mysticism to the characters’ actions in a book I would never read. With all my respect to Kafka, Spanish mysticism and books I’d never read! Sorry, I’m very squared-headed, you can hardly take me out of romance, but as I said, I choose where to invest my time. And I respect where people choose to invest theirs. So if the author geniunely looks for a honest review, he’s going to find it here. We are humans at our best (or worst) here, like it or not. But if he wants his ego to be stroked, he’ll be utterly disappointed, unless he is a really good writer or he searches around very well and finds those people who rate 5 stars all the time. But it doesn’t sound like he found them.

No, I’m not naive enough to say GR is perfect. I’m not naive enough to say democracy is perfect, either. But it’s the best system we have right now. The time when a better system comes, you tell me. But going Nazi is not my definition of an improvement. So, your argument is invalid, dear author.

You think writing a book and making your way into the written word is hell? Get into the ballet world and you’ll know what real hell is.

Also, I looked my ratings and saw I have a Gaussian distribution. So don’t worry, you can take me seriously.

In conclusion: if you want awesome reviews, write an awesome book. You’ll see that formula is bulletproof. And even those get negative reviews. Face it, nothing is 100% success!"

I read this today afternoon, and since it was quite an entertaining read, I decided to give it three stars.

I was quite shocked that GR was adding authors against their wishes, and getting their books reviewed by trolls and carpet-bombed with one-star ratings. To me, this is the intellectual equivalent of kidnap and gang-rape. To be honest, however, I could not for the life of me think of a way to prevent GR from adding a book to their database. Maybe there is a legal recourse against having an author page - or maybe having a disclaimer sort of thing ""this author is here against his/ her wishes"": I don't know. Serious legal minds have to debate on this issue.

Most of the author's arguments against the review system, however, is self-defeating. Removing the like buttons, the rating system and the comment thread will take all fun out of reviewing. Most of us readers are here for chatting with like-minded people on books, and getting that ""ego-boost"" (as Zoe Desh says)from seeing others appreciating us. But we can really think about the dislike button - I suspect many of my reviews will see a flurry of activity if that is implemented!

There are, of course, some bizarre suggestions which cannot be implemented. I quote two below:



I cannot for the life of me think of a way to find out whether a book has been read by a particular reviewer from the author's sales figures. I suspect there is some higher mathematics involved here, possibly involving partial differential equations and Laplace transforms.



Even though this is a laudable suggestion, since books are many a time added by reviewers themselves, GR would have to employ virtually an army to check out what has been added and contact the authors. And suppose the author is from a third-world country - where most people don't read, according to Ms. Desh - consider what a nightmare this would be. This will effectively kill the site.

My personal feeling is that when one publishes a book, one should be brave enough to let it go out into the world by itself and survive. If it dies at the first whiff of adverse opinion, maybe it was not worth saving at all.

-------------------------------

Based on the excellent suggestions from the various erudite ladies and gentlemen on the comment thread, i hereby put forward a proposal to make the reviewing system on GR more honest.

1. Have the reviewer answer a set of questions on the book before writing the review. The questions shall be randomly chosen from a set prepared by the author him/ herself.

2. The reviewer has to attain a certain passing grade (say 70%) to be allowed to write a review.

3. In order to prevent countless multiple attempts, a maximum of three chances shall be provided. The second and third chance shall entail payment. If the reviewer misses out on the third chance, he/ she will not be allowed to review that book...ever.

4. In order to prevent multiple sock puppet accounts, henceforth all reviewers in GR will have to provide passport copies at the time of joining, and should be attested by three GR members of good standing.

5. If reviewer fails on answering the questions correctly for three books, his/ her account shall be suspended for a period of three months. If the offence is repeated, the account shall be frozen for a year. A third offence shall result in a life ban.

6. The above does not prevent the possibility of a troll reviewer reading a book and still providing a snarky review. To prevent this, an arbitration panel comprising of an equal number of reviewers and authors shall be set up. Each reviewer has to post a bond of 1000$ should his/ her review be challenged. If the challenge is held up, the money shall be forfeited and divided equally among the author and GR.

7. To ensure that the reviewer has sufficient capability for reviewing, he/ she shall have to pass an examination where three books of suitable complexity will be given for review ( and are examples which readily spring to mind). He/ she has to review the same and the review shall be analysed by an expert panel of judges, who will pronounce whether the reviewer is capable to review books on GR.

-------------------------------









No, the above is not a horror story: this is the truth at GR, according to the author... and who am I to dispute the firsthand experience of such an erudite person? To avoid this site from transforming into a police state in the control of these terrible creatures and their trolls, I make the following modest suggestions:

1. The 50 reviews that librarians have to publish as a minimum should be examined by the aforementioned panel of authors and readers. .

2. Once a reader becomes a librarian, he/ she should not be allowed to review books. We do not allow referees to play matches, do we?

3. All librarians should be forced to set their profile data to private and all their friends should be removed. They should not be allowed to participate in any public forum or discussion. This will effectively prevent them from calling upon their pet trolls.

These are the suggestions which I can think of right off the top of my head. Hopefully Manny et al. will build on it.

Added as suggested by Manny:

4. All librarians must agree to pledge vows of lifelong poverty, chastity, obedience and silence.

5. Any librarian defaulting on the vows of (4) will have their brain removed and placed in a vat, where it will continue to perform internet librarian functions through a suitable interface.

-----------------------------------------------------------



The like button on a review should have five options:

1. I love this review; the reviewer is out of this world!
2. I like this review; the reviewer is very skilled.
3. This review is OK; the reviewer seems a decent enough chap.
4. This review is bad. The reviewer should be doing a more productive job (like cleaning toilets, for example)
5. This review is CRAP! The reviewer should banned for life from Goodreads!

Based on the number votes on each option, GR can take a decision on the reviewer."

You know what is the one quality I admire most in an author miss ""Zoe""?? Their ability to accept criticism! It is the one thing that can help a mediocre writer evolve into a great one. When you listen to readers and accept their opinions you can grow as an author.

Me pregunto que hemos hecho para ser tan malas personas, y digo somos refiriéndome a la comunidad de GR porque, de acuerdo con Zoe Desh la mayoría somos unos acosadores que, por deporte, invertimos tiempo en dar una calificación y una reseña los libros que no hemos leído.

La siguiente imagen muestra como nos ve el autor:


Vamos aclarando las cosas. Yo adoró GoodReads, es la única red social que utilizó y realmente me encanta compartir con toda la comunidad con la tengo contacto a través de esta plataforma. De vez en cuando podemos encontrarnos con usuarios, lectores o autores, que no son los más amables pero es el mínimo, mientras que Desh piensa que todos somo así.



Este libro lo considero un ensayo de la autora acerca de los peligros de poner tu libro en un lugar donde los lectores pueden dar su opinión. Claramente ningún autor, ninguna editorial ni ninguna librería quiere feedback gratuito cómo el que damos aquí. Y esto va en serio: reseña, buena o mala, debería servir al autor como un a retroalimentación para mejorar su trabajo posterior.

Realmente el autor es apasionado sobre los ataques (o más bien creo que son malas reseñas) que ha recibido en GR. Se nota que el tema le llega y le afecta, su opinión es tan valida como la de cualquiera de nosotros pero darla desde la desinformación y la manipulación de declaraciones claramente un problema. (para que lo descubran vean el sitio web donde está colgado este escrito y chequen los links que ofrece). Entiendo su frustración, todos queremos ver nuestro trabajo triunfar, pero no vale querer decir que GR es una dictadura enfocada en hacer que los pobres autores mueran de vergüenza y sean humillados por su trabajo.

En honor a este libro iré a buscar algunos amigos con los cuales iniciar un trabajo de mega pandillas troll para atacar libros que no hemos leído, con reseñas que tengan un .gif bailando, y darnos 10,000 likes entre nosotros convertiéndonos así en los más poderosos de GR (exceptuando a los bibliotecarios, obvio)

I wonder what we have done to be as bad people, and I say ""we""referring to all GR community because, according to Zoe Desh most of us are stalkers that, for sport, invest time to give a rating and review to books we haven't read.

The following image shows how the author sees us:


Let's clarify things. I love Goodreads is the only social network that used and I really enjoy share with the entire community which I contact through this platform. Occasionally we can find users, readers or authors, who aren't the most friendly but is the minimum, while Desh think that we are all this way.



I consider this book an essay about the dangers of putting your book in a place where readers can give their opinion. Clearly no author, publisher or bookstore wants free feedback like the one we give here. And this is serious: review, good or bad, should serve the author as help to improve his later work.

The author is really passionate about the attacks (or bad reviews, i think) he has received in GR. It is noted that the issue reaches you and affects you, your opinion is as valid as any other, but give it from disinformation and manipulation of statements is clearly a problem. (To discover this you need check the website and check the links he offered). I understand his frustration, we all want to see our work succeed, but not worth mean that GR is a dictatorship focused on making the poor authors die of shame and be humiliated for their work.

In honor of this book I'll get some friends to start a superpowerfull troll work: we going to attack books we have not read, with reviews that have a really fun .gif, and give us 10,000 likes between us and become the most powerful people on GR (except for the librarians, obviously)

Authors vs. Goodreads,Jess-i-ca ~Sometimes a Gif Witch~,"January 20, 2015",,Here is my non-review review :)
Authors vs. Goodreads,Jim,"January 21, 2015",2.0,"It’s obvious that this author didn’t have a good experience putting her books on GR & it would be easy to dismiss it as whining, but I think she has a point. Authors, especially new ones, have very little guidance & support from GR. Worse, because of the abuses of a few, many GR users are frankly hostile to new authors. She blames GR for this & suggests fixes, but it’s obvious that she is only looking at this from the perspective of her works – new, self-published ebooks.

There has never been a time when so many have been so free to publish so much, yet the reading of long works is on the decline according to a book I’m reading now. Readers must choose what to devote our limited time to & we sometimes callously write off works. I try to give new authors the benefit of the doubt, but I trip over a dozen new ones in the groups or my mailbox most days. They’re like commercials; minor annoyances that I tend to flip past quickly.

She divides us into camps; readers, staff & authors, but really we’re just a bunch of individuals & hybrids. GR was created for & is geared primarily toward readers, though. Some are jerks, but most are indifferent to nice, just like any large group of strangers. Some abuse the system, but most don’t. I’ve been using GR for over 7 years & generally like it a lot. Since I disagree with much of this author wrote, so I’m going to give her a reader’s perspective.


Really? I know quite a few authors, met them through GR & while they've all admitted there can be some jerks around (With 20+million users that's to be expected.) none have ever told me that GR itself has been mean to them.

The author then goes on to say that the task of marketing is daunting & the author would rather be writing. I agree. I’ve seen how badly a single, poor review can hurt an established author with over a dozen traditionally published books & decades of experience. Another, who has since become a success, was a manic-depressive as his early reviews came out. I’ve come to the conclusion that No good ever comes of it, just stokes the fire, especially when they comment. Authors should never, ever comment on their reviews. I wrote an example of why here:


They shouldn’t market their books, either. Authors are artists, personalities antithetical to the type needed for sales & marketing. That’s what publishers are for. No, they’re not doing a great job, so authors are being forced into roles they’re not suited for by the current market, not just GR.

She points out - correctly - that author names get mixed up sometimes & incorrectly have each other's works assigned to them. Yes, it happens & everyone hates it. Both staff & volunteer librarians work constantly to keep them straight. People & automatic software goof. If you notice this, tell a librarian. There are a lot of us around, but some of us (me) don’t do much unless we stumble on a problem that we know we can fix AND have the time.

Yes, GR is owned by Amazon. Otis & Elizabeth sold out. (Congrats to them!!!) No, I'm not tickled about it from a personal standpoint either, but that's the capitalist system. So far as I can tell, there hasn't been any change to the way the site works for me.

She's right that GR is very streamlined & tech support is minimal. They seem quite fast catching flags (spam), though. As for features, they certainly do come & go with usability. It's ticked me off more than once, too.

'Readers come first'. She's right. This is a site dedicated to discussing books by readers. I'm often not happy about the way authors are treated in groups & have left several because of it. In all fairness though, some authors are quite obnoxious. Many are pigeon-authors; they fly through, spam groups, & leave. Unfortunately, they've gotten a lot of people's backs up & ruined the site for other authors.

Remember, groups are not democracies, they are tyrannies. The moderator/creator of the group pretty much has free rein. No one is forced to join any group, though. If you don't like one, leave it, find a similar one (there are thousands) or start your own.



GR staff should top the list. I'm a librarian with no more of a line to GR personnel than any other user nor would I knowingly mess up an author's page or books. If one does, report it. That's just wrong. I don't doubt it's happened, but I think it is rare. There are change logs & most of us don't have the time to do the proper work much less create more with errors & complaints.

She says readers are next in the hierarchy & pampered. Seriously? No, we can't write any review we want. GR tightened up on that well before this was published. Many readers screamed censorship & quit at this minor tightening of rules because they could no longer discuss just the author or use some nasty shelf names. It was much needed, IMO. Still, readers can certainly say they don't like a book. They do not have to show proof they read the book. No, it isn't perfect, but a review is simply their opinion. It’s not a writ from the gods & people do have different tastes.

Trolls are not unique to GR & authors are at least semi- public figures. Many want to be public to promote their books.

The last paragraph of this section is a hoot.

Have you read the terms of use for any other site or software program? They basically say the same thing. ‘Use this with no warranties & if something bad happens – tough.’ I see it all the time on critical software that we pump tens of thousands of $$$ & hundreds of man-hours of work into. It sucks. There is no mortgage involved as is implied. There likely is for advertising, but that’s never cheap. Plus you’re dealing with marketing & sales types, a sneaky bunch with expensive tastes. (I have family in both & I say that to their faces often.)

Again, authors are at least semi-public figures & the terms of use for the sites they've listed their books on allow Amazon & GR to suck in their data. Get used to it. Sites do the same thing pulling from private individuals & sites all the time. It's not always right, but it's the digital age. If you want privacy & security, stay off the web. How you’ll sell books is beyond me, though.

She starts off with,

I disagree. I've known several authors who got a good start on GR & know many others who joined to keep up with their fans. For the most part, we readers are passionate, knowledgeable, opinionated, & demanding. No, we’re, not always kind to authors, but how many consumers are kind to the manufacturer? We want more for less & we’re often pestered with poor writing & blatant, rude advertising.

As for rating system & reviews being laughable or useless, some are, but most are good ones. They certainly help me & I use them all the time. I’ve never read more & better in my life & I’ve been a big reader for more than 40 years.

I don’t understand her logic saying that the ratings should be abolished or not counted in the overall average. Where would the average come from? Books with very few ratings can suffer from a few bad ones, but the number of ratings is right there. If a bunch of brownheads are just handing out 1 star, it’s an obvious hatchet job.

It doesn't really matter to me, anyway. Neither overall star rating nor a few poor reviews are going to make up my mind. I have GR friends who have similar reading tastes to help me make my reading decisions. Their reviews show first & I read them. If I'm still on the fence, I look at the Community Reviews. I read a few of each star rating. I can quickly spot & dismiss any hatchet jobs, but people tend to rail about what bugs them, so I often find the negatives more helpful than the positives. For instance, I detest stream-of-consciousness writing, artsy punctuation, & poor editing. If several mention those points, I won't bother with the book, no matter how highly rated or popular it is. Others hate first person writing. I love it, so even if a reviewer rates a book lower for that, it helps it in my estimation.

There are millions of books already published & another million being published every year now. I read a lot, well over 100 each year & have for the past 45. Even if I read 200/year until I’m 100, I'll still have only read a tiny percentage of those published this year alone. Why should I bother with anything I won't really like? My TBR stack is huge & I'm often given free books for review. I read (at least start) dozens of these each year. Only a few ever get a public review since I won't give a new author a public review unless it's 4 stars or better. It’s their call on a 3 star & they get to read the review first.

The 'like' button is a reviewer rating system. There is no need for a 'dislike' button IMO. I use the 'like' button as an indication that the review has been read & acknowledged as a helpful review of the book. Several of my friends are top or best reviewers & they do a damn fine job. These lists are a good place to start if you’re looking for good reviews that agree with your tastes.

I gave just a star rating to those books I read before I joined GR. It helped me find people with similar reading tastes. I have gone back & reviewed some & I’ve always reviewed them since mid 2008 or so, but what can I say about Destroyer #88 that I read over a decade (2?) ago? Hell, I didn't say much about Quarry #12 that I just finished yesterday. It was fun & had more sex, but otherwise another typical of the series. It got 3 stars instead of the 4 stars most of the earlier ones got. That says it all, doesn't it?

My ‘achievements’ on GR are simply a matter of time & constant use performed for my personal satisfaction. I am not & never have considered myself a “damned important person on Goodreads”. No one pays me anything for my opinions on books & I’m sure most don’t care. I review for myself. I love being able to refresh my memory on books when they come up for discussion or to turn someone on to a good one. I export my books occasionally & run a macro so that I can see what & how I’m reading. This year, I summed it up pretty well in this book review:


No, some readers won't read indie authors. They feel they're not worth their time due to the poor quality of writing & editing in so many of them. I read quite a few & have found some great ones, but I also lament the poor editing at times. It can be very tough for a new author to find & afford a good editing team. Many skip the step & they shouldn't.

Overall, reviews aren't perfect, but if you're using them to find a book, it's on you to do some due diligence as to the quality of the advice you're getting, especially since it is free. Anyone too lazy or stupid to do that probably won't be a reader the author wants giving an opinion on their baby, anyway.

Yes, assholes can game the system. Report abuse if you notice it. I do. It's usually quickly taken care of. GR has no tolerance for sock puppets, but if a group gangs up on an author GR staff probably don't have a lot of recourse under the rules they have to play by, either. If things are loose enough for folks to be comfortable, someone will figure out how to make others miserable. You can’t legislate assholes out of existence. (Would any of us survive such a purge?) Ignore them & they usually get bored & go away.

I already disagreed with the idea of doing away with the star system above, but the next idea of not being allowed to review a book that I didn't finish is plain silly. If I start a book & don't like it enough to finish it, I should be allowed to say why. It happens. Sometimes it's my mood & I say so. Other times I just don’t like the book. This opinion is not limited to indy books, but includes popular ones, classics, & occasionally ones by favorite authors. I feel I’ve made enough of an effort to have an informed opinion. I have over 2400 books on my shelves & only 70 on my ‘could-not-finish’ shelf.

I also have a 'do-not-read' shelf. Most are nonfiction books where the research was bogus or bad, but one is a kiddie porn book by, the author of . Another book promotes child abuse by religious fanatics from what I’ve read (articles linked in my review). I want to steer myself & other folks away from them. I generally don’t give books on this shelf a star rating since I haven’t even attempted to read them. I don’t think they show in community reviews, but are visible to my friends.

Using sales figures for deciding if a book was read or not is silly. There are millions of books & many resold or given privately, while others are pirated. (IMO, little-known authors should love piracy. It spreads their work around.) How big a staff do you think it would take to just gather the new book sales? Sheesh! This author already complained that author names aren't always right & tech support takes too long. Who's paying for all this extra staff?

I've had some of my best conversations about books in the comments of book reviews. Many contain priceless info, too. That's tossing out the baby with the bath water - silly. IMO, this is one of the greatest things about GR, discussing books with others of differing opinions outside of groups & with a different set of people – friends of friends & followers.

While thin, I don’t think the documentation is impenetrable, but then I’m a computer guy. I read poor documentation constantly & broken links are common.

I agree that some things are broken on the site more often than I’d like. Similar to many other service & software companies, GR seems to like adding bells & whistles than fixing existing issues. It’s frustrating for us readers, too.

I read a short story by an indie author through the “read book” button back in Oct 2014 & liked it so much that I used the “Get a copy:” button to buy one of her books from Amazon. Amazon has its own button & is at the top of the ‘Online Stores’ by default, but these buttons are configurable within each user’s profile for their preferred vendors. I generally use the ‘Book links’ button to search ‘PaperBackSwap’ or ‘BookMooch’ first since I have a lot of credits on them. The book I’m looking for generally comes up without a problem, but I’ve had to copy in the title &/or author before, too. Since GR already got me to the right place in another tab, it doesn’t bother me much, though.

Well, it’s clear enough she had a bad time of it on GR. I’m sorry for that because I like the place. I’m sure it is fraught with frustration for some, but I think her experience was the exception, not the rule. I think all new authors should pay attention to this. I doubt GR is the only place full of such frustrations & pitfalls."
Authors vs. Goodreads,Christine,"May 6, 2015",1.0,"To call this rant stupid would insult stupid people. Funny how the author is okay with not reading a book if she is the one doing it.

I cannot be the only who realizes any review is subjective?"
Authors vs. Goodreads,"Ian ""Marvin"" Graye","January 29, 2015",2.0,"Overview

I didn't think this book was as bad as some reviews suggest.

It adopts a particular worldview, and it expresses it succinctly within the limits of the author's ability.

Ironically, much of the language reminded me of the months when GR was full of readers whinging and moaning about GoodReads - the Amazon acquisition, and the subsequent changes to the terms and conditions.

It's easily forgotten that there is at least a three-way relationship occurring on the pages of GR (I'll retain the adversary language of the book title):

* Authors/Publishers vs GoodReads

* Authors/Publishers vs Readers

* Readers vs GoodReads.



The author's comments about this relationship are revealing.

Of course it's understandable that an author/publisher sees their own task as marketing.

However, that doesn't mean that the GR website and community is solely there for the purpose of exploiting the marketing potential of the author/publisher.

This author seems to say that, if I don't like the way your readers are responding to my book, then I will withdraw it from your database.

Regardless of who produces them or who owns them, the reality is that it's in the public interest that there be databases of this sort, and I can't see how an author/publisher can withdraw permission for their book to be on one.



While an author might want to control their own marketing, they can't control the reception of the book by readers.

Once the book is out there in the public forum, they are vulnerable to the vagaries of public opinion.

Not everybody will like your book. Not everybody will want to spend time explaining why they did or didn't like it.

Personally, I don't think it matters whether you read or finished the book. I don't place a lot of weight on a star rating without a review. If you've written a review, it might become apparent to another reader whether you have read it or whether your views have any merit.

The author complains about star ratings that aren't accompanied by a review, and suggests that they be banned.

I don't agree with that approach. However, I do question whether it should be possible to ""like"" a star rating that is not accompanied by a substantive review.

Isn't a ""like"" effectively a comment on the merit of the review?



I don't have anything more to say about this issue than I said at the time.

However, obviously, the perception of many readers at the time was that Amazon/GR had erred on the side of Authors/Publishers (because their commercial interests are aligned).

The author assumes that the interests of GR and readers are 100% aligned.

This is the ultimate proof that the author of this book has misread the politics of the GR community, because they are thinking only of their own commercial interests.



One issue that isn't raised directly in the book is the relationship between readers within the GR community.

Personally, I had hoped that GR would be a community within which you could express diverse views, and that you could debate those views without being accused of trolling.

A ""like"" is one method of providing feedback on a review.

As I've said, I'm not sure whether there is any point in being able to ""like"" a star rating. Why should a like of a star rating count towards the statistics with respect to a reader's popularity?

Increasingly, it seems that a ""like"" simply means that I agree with the views that you expressed in your review. I see less and less ""liking"" accompanied by debate from different perspectives and/or an agreement to disagree. In fact, I see more and more examples of I want to withhold my ""like"", but I still want to debate you (sometimes from behind a private profile).

Thus, the withholding of ""likes"" has become a way of communicating views within the GR community, as have private requests to get readers to withdraw ""likes"".

I suppose it would be democratic to allow a ""do not like"" button. However, its absence forces the reader to either remain silent or express the reason for their dislike in the thread. The absence of a button therefore contributes to debate.

Personally, I think it's better to force words out of a reader rather than giving them the option to ""tag"" a review with their symbolic dislike.

The author suggests that the threads be removed from reviews altogether.

This suggestion totally misunderstands the value of discussion and debate within a community and within society at large.

If anything is lacking in the current iteration of GR, it is the lack of robust debate between different views. The community seems to have balkanised along the lines of particular agendas or camps or house views, which seems to have lead to fence-building and boundary enforcement. Where are the rugged individualists of yesteryear? Come back to the raft, ag'in, Bird Brian, honey!"

Even though it is only January, I am confident that in 2015 I won't read something that is more ludicrous than Zoe Desh's ignorant, misinformed, hateful, revengeful and moronic conspiracy theory.

Oh yeah, and that you can't trust any book reviews or ratings on Goodreads because, as I just mentioned, all reviewers are trolls. As I write this, the average star rating for Zoe Desh's book is 1.27. Yup, that sounds about right.

Authors vs. Goodreads,Laura,"January 25, 2015",1.0,"Well, wasn't that interesting?

I thought I was going to laugh but I did not. I'm actually feeling rather offended and who knew I would find out so many things about myself as a reader?

I want to take a moment to apologize to all of you who may read this review (oh, wait, can I call this a review?) I'm really upset right now and when it happens I'm known for making meaning mistakes and English isn't my native language.



Why did I read this? Because I wanted to see what the fuck was this all about.
But go figure this wasn't a light reading. Nope. More like a heavy ranting. A bitchy heavy ranting.

So, let me tell you what I learned from this.

1. I am, as all of you, a Goodreads' minion.
2. What I've always known as ""communication"" and ""sharing opinions"" is actually stroking people's ego.
3. If you are, or I am, an author here then we pretty much sold our souls to the Devil.
4. We all are potential writing bullies and it seems that we roam in packs.
5. If I am a Librarian then I have a strong connection with God, therefore I'm Jesus (no offense here, really).
6. I am a pampered person because I want to rate, review and talk about a book I bought with the money I was born with. Obviously, I'm fucking rich but hey, that doesn't mean I actually read the book.

I can go on and on and on and I'm pretty sure this a ranting too but humor me, we're all minions here.

I'm taking this maybe a little too personal, but I was really offended by Desh when she claimed Wow, so, when it comes to, I don't know, grocery stores, aren't we all pampered because we are the engine that keeps them alive by buying their products? If we follow that statement, we are.

If you, Desh, are reading this and I believe you are under one of your unknown profiles (since it's something it can be easily be done, thank you for pointing it out) let me tell you how ""pampered"" I am.
I am a 22 years old college student. I do not have a job due my tight schedule or let's say I have a part-time job, why not, it'll make it all easy.

(I'm going to use dollars to explain myself) Let's say I want to buy a copy of City of Bones by Cassandra Clare, yes? Well, the paperback price (Barnes & Noble) it's $8.32 and if you want the hardcover one then you can get it for $16.03 (again, Barnes & Noble). It's all right, those are good prices. Well, I don't live in the U.S. but my country ins't that tiny, using Desh's words, but when it comes to books Colombia sucks at it. Now things are better than before but still if I want to buy that same paperback it'll cost me around $43.00 Trust me, I bought it. And forget about hardcovers, we don't get them. Really. Like we don't get 95% of the books most countries (as in U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and some more) and if we do get them, gee, then I'm sure it'll cost me around 50 to 70 dollars per book.
I'm not poor, I'm middle class, I have not come here to tell you that buying books is expensive as fuck, that we do not get them right when they come out because they have to be traslated and they won't bring books in English without having the Spanish traslation first. Nor I am here to let you know that it's absolutely hard to find some really good new authors when I go to my local bookstore because sadly they only bring us books from well-known authors or authors they're sure they'll be huge. No Indie Authors for me. But when a person comes and tries to making me feel bad about the way I express myself, then fuck it.
I can only, if I am lucky, buy 1 book per month and that's saving money each day. Money I don't have since all of it goes to my transportation and college expenses, so, Desh, trust me, if I get to buy a book per month then I WILL READ said book.



Now, I'm sorry, Desh. I'm sorry because I'm a beginner writer and I have (sort of) published some of my work during college and I know we all are sensitive and protective of what is ours but, Zoe, as I reader I'm insulted by you, as I writer, I feel shame for you because when writing a book the first thing you have to ask yourself is if you're doing it because you want to share what's on your mind with people or you just want fame.
Call me liar, please.
I think, Desh, you wanted fame.
I think you could not handle a bad review. And with this I'm not saying there aren't mean people here, because there are. A lot of them and but we are not all of them. Libriarians are not the Devil's spawn and reviewrs are not evil minions. I'm sorry you feel that way but that's not excuse for your trying to ruin this experiencie for everyone else.

Goodreads has A LOT of flaws, all system have, and it's true that Goodreads delegates a lot of work but that's why I love being here. I've found incredible people here and new authors and new books that if it wasn't for this plataform, I would have never known about.

As authors, you all are powerful people here. We look up to you, we try to get your attention, we love reading your updates, we enjoy sharing a few words with you so you ARE NOT AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS NON-EXISTENT CHAIN. We respect you and we love you and you inspire us. So, please, do not generalize what happened to you, Desh.

So if you are a writer because of the money then yeah, you're gonna be upset if/when you receive a bad review but let me tell you that we all have the right to think whatever we want to think without being rude. If people, Desh, were rude to you, shame on them but doing this? Sweetheart, what a waste. Not everyone is going to love your writing and that's normal, you cannot please everyone.

But this? A shame.

I will not feel bad for commenting on my friends' reviews and when I became a Librarian I will not feel bad either and when I became a writer I will not write a 24 pages rant for not getting a good review.

Now I will dance."

Like a lot of people in the aughts, I did not like Paris Hilton. She was loud and tacky and didn't play by the ""rules."" What these rules were, exactly, I wasn't quite sure, but I knew that she didn't fit them. In the early 2000s, a lot of magazines had ""hot or not"" columns, and Paris Hilton was always in the ""not."" Oh, how the tabloids loved to demean her for her visible whale tails and various wardrobe malfunctions. And taking our cue in this pre-internet era, the rest of us followed suit like sheep.



My thoughts on Hilton changed when I read a biography about her family (and learned, from the contemporaneous portion at the end, that she was not estranged from or disinherited by her great-grandfather, who was actually quite impressed by her business acumen). I also read interviews with her about her television cameos and the roles she played for the paparazzi and was jarred by how self-aware and effacing she was about the partygirl persona she cultivated by the cameras. I started to think Paris Hilton might actually be OK. Then I watched the TV show , where she tries out various recipes and then hosts dinner parties with various celebrity friends, and found myself... charmed.



2004-era Nenia would NEVER.



When CONFESSIONS OF AN HEIRESS went on sale, I knew I had to buy it. Even though this is a book I would have sneered at when it came out, adult me is a sophisticated and classy lady who is a connoisseur of good taste in bad taste. I'm actually shocked it has such low ratings, to be honest. I have to think that people picked this book up and took it at face-value, when the whole book is basically a parody of an instruction guide where she half-laughs at herself and half-laughs at you, the reader. It's almost a ridiculous parody of a self-help book because of how unachievable her lifestyle is (and she knows it), but peppered in is some genuinely good advice, like not treating people being broke as a deal-breaker for relationships or remembering to carry small bills while traveling to tip.



The best portions of this book are the photographs. This is a veritable lookbook of early 2000s fashion, for better or for worse. Bucket hats. Asymmetric skirts. Low, low, low-rise jeans. Micro miniskirts. She even has a gallery in the back where she discusses some of her worst fashion faux-pas. She also. WRITES. A JOURNAL. PRETENDING. TO BE. HER . I also really enjoyed the chapter about her sister and the one at the end about her family and dating life. No, she doesn't really dish anything too personal, but she told you up front that she wouldn't. More fool you for not believing her.



I guess I am a Paris Hilton fan now. What can I say? I like people who are ridiculous but still real, and I don't think she's ever actually done anything super bad (apart from acting like a fool on camera). Her insights into her role on the were interesting and actually made me want to watch the show. Her love of cooking is hinted at here and makes seem like a passion project. She also hints at wanting to create an affordable fashion line, which she did-- several times. I think she actually has a collection of Juicy Couture-esque tracksuits that are just a little cheaper than Juicy. I also own some of her home cookware which is also super affordable and surprisingly high quality. Maybe she was loud and tacky and didn't play by the rules. But it's 2020, and people are starting to realize that when it comes to how to win at being a woman, rules were basically made to be broken, anyway.

Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,Camille,"March 20, 2014",5.0,"Anyone who dislikes Paris for being vapid, superficial, or fake has been totally duped. This book proves just how much she is ""in on the joke."" Why was she the first reality-star celeb, the original Kim Kardashian? Because she knew what the public wanted and she gave it to them, on her show and then in the endeavors that followed. She knew that she was a symbol of excess wealth and oblivious airheadedness, and she lived up to that expectation. She's not dumb, she's smart. She's never going to be a Harvard PhD, but she's self-aware. She knew that people bought the magazine to see what crazy, revealing, expensive outfit she was wearing, what silly thing she was quoted as saying (""Walmart? do they sell like, wall stuff?""). She was the archetype of the ditzy, overprivileged blonde that America took pleasure in laughing at, because it makes less privileged people feel better about how intelligent and virtuous they are. Saying, ""see? I may not have that much money, but at least I have common sense/can drive a tractor/can hold down a fast food job/can pump my own gas"" (all little things she would mess up at doing on The Simple Life).

The truth about Paris is that no one deserves the hate she's gotten (even though she was opening herself up to it). Her career exploded because of a sex tape that was released WITHOUT her permission (ringing any bells? Kim K had this happen to her as well). And the public was quick to yell ""scandal! slut!"" at her instead of laying their outrage on the real bad guy, her ex who released it. Can you imagine that happening to you? But instead of letting it shame her, she took advantage of the opportunities it brought her. She would always have been supported by her parents, but she took her 15 minutes of fame and extended it to years and years. She starred on TV, appeared in movies, released perfumes and books. To this day she's a cultural icon (in the sense that everyone knows her name and will say things like ""wow that girl looks/sounds like Paris Hilton!""). And she's never been accused of abuse, like so many famous people, or of racism or general mean-spiritedness. She's kind. She loves animals and takes care of them well. She never complains about intrusive media coverage and the paparazzi love her because she will greet them and smile.

Says Paris about how she acted on The Simple Life: ”I would do the baby voice and it’s kind of like this character I made up...But in real life I’m completely different, I’m very down to earth, I’m smart, I know what’s going on...It’s kind of like I almost play to the image and kind of have a laugh at myself about it.”

And around people she trusts, she just acts like herself.

”I think a lot of people will assume that I’m just like an airhead. But in my everyday life, when I’m hanging out with my friends or if I’m in a business meeting I’ll talk in my normal voice.”

Like if you agree that she doesn't deserve the hate! xoxo"

I consider Paris Hilton a genius in that she's managed to arise to super Pop Culture Stardom doing NOTHING. Which is why I traded a book for this book. I planned to figure out what shot her so far. In that sense I was disappointed. She's not as deep as I thought, she doesn't have a master secret, or secret genius (at least not revealed in this book).

I DID found out some interesting aspects of her life that I didn't know before, like how she grew up in the Waldorf and has tons of cousins and conned cash from her little sister when they were younger. Also that she had a curfew of midnight until she was seventeen (like me). It's insightful to see how she was raised.

I was also surprised at all the pictures of her, I'm visually inclined and this helps me judge things I don't already know of I suppose.

MY FAVORITE PART OF THE BOOK: The section where she details the Fashion Don't's by pointing to specific outfits SHE wore. It's easy to point and laugh at other people's mistakes but to post pictures of yourself that are just awful in a book supposedly glamourizing yourself is just awesome. She wins points with me there.

Don't expect to find anything deep about Paris in this book, sure she can sound like everyone else but she can also sound very snobby (this is where I disagree with her comment about being self aware). She adores Abercrombie models (her perfect man), she likes being OVERLY GROSSLY girly, and considers being ditzy a plus (she says it's best people think you're less smart than you are [I disagree:])

It was a fun book, although I got it for free. Depends on how much you like Pop Culture I suppose."

Republicans dislike her, children don't especially idolize her, not too many people find her attractive. Fantastic! I think it is really unhealthy to idolize movie stars or models that seem ""normal"" almost someone you could easily be. Bad for the self-esteem. Better to admire a disaster. We will never be perfect like Katie Holmes, but we can make everything we own pink and change our names. This book is full of advice. If you aren't famous pretend to be. If you can't afford designer things just go for colorful things. Change your name whenever you feel like it, don't let boys control you. It is cute, it is what it is. Paris claims she is very self-aware...not too sure about that, but she is definitely not as out of control as it seems, this book is proof. Good rainy day read."
Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,Stephanie,"January 26, 2015",5.0,I love this book. It's as if you're having a cup of coffee and chat with Paris herself. She gives you confidence to be yourself with her honesty and care.
Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,Marla Haasz,"January 31, 2016",5.0,"Paris, not France.

""Such an air-head"", ""Does she have any braincells"", ""God, she's just so dumb""... but is she? Is she really? I think it would take an absolute genius to make the entire world hate you while simultaneously make you mad money.

This book was strategically planned and produced to uphold Hilton's 20-something-year manifested image; a brainless blonde with too much money from mummy and daddy. Actually, her entire public life has been strategically planned so you buy that trashy magazine with Paris at a nightclub on the cover, so that you buy her perfumes even though you told everyone you deplore her.

The people who fell for this and find themselves shaking with anger or laughing at her stupidity are the successful outcome of her genius product. As we speak, Hilton is rolling in your cash with her production team near by, celebrating with some 100% Pinot Noir and giggling to herself about her foolish targets who ACTUALLY think that her high-pitched early 00's teen movie accent is the real deal and not the smoke screen for her concoction.

Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,laura,"April 7, 2009",,WORST SHIT EVER. Bought this when I was younger; straight up picture book of Paris Hilton with little blurbs about her life. Waste of time. I give this zero stars.
Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,Samantha Glasser,"January 8, 2013",2.0,"I loved the Simple Life and I wanted to give Paris the benefit of the doubt. She's beautiful and I liked her show, so why should I hate her instantly?

The writing lived up to my expectations. It was clearly written by a girl who isn't incredibly versed (or perhaps by her ghostwriters). However, I did find myself agreeing with minor quotes like, ""Accept free stuff. If people want to give it to me, why shouldn't I take it?"" and ""When I see people in embarrassing situations, I never laugh at them because I always feel really bad for them. I know how they feel.""

There are parts where Hilton makes fun of herself. She lists things that an heiress would do as if everyone reading could do the same. She laughs at her wealth and the emphasis the media places on it. I got the sense from the book that she is a carefree girl out to have a good time. The many photos littering this book prove she has a flair for fashion and fun.

The pages aren't dripping with literary genius or philosophical breakthroughs. They're simply a representation of a glamorous life that some people can't get enough of. Fans don't love Hilton for her wit; they love her for her beauty and her sense of fun. That is exactly what you get from this book."
Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,Bam Martin,"April 4, 2008",4.0,"While the sparkly pink cover and picture book layout may contribute to Paris’s already ditzy reputation, the words inside give new insight. Personally, I am a big fan of Paris Hilton and I thought the book was really honest and therefore shine’s a good light on her. It makes you kind of jealous all the nice things she can buy, the trips she takes and the treatment you get as a star, but also the hard work that goes into it. While it seems like Paris enjoys everything she does, being a star means you must be constantly ready. You step out of your house and you look great, you never wear the same dress twice or ever look tired. Of course that’s not even half of it. You learn a lot about Paris’s own ambitions, as an actress, model, ex. It gives Paris fans little hints about what kind of make up she likes, or colors she wears; while also taking about her family life, friends and boyfriends. In general I think that any reader of this book will take what they want from it. If they want to see Paris as ditzy or motivated the book has support for both, but either can only further promote her fame."

Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,Shalma M,"April 23, 2015",1.0,"I mean... it is what it is. That's really a sufficient review.
I picked this up at some point in my mid-teens. I vividly remember the cover, for some reason. I mean, it basically defines the color pink (although... not the best shades, I have to point out). Can't remember the exact situation of how it came into my hands. I also recall reading one of Nicole Richie's books around that time, and I never owned or deliberately borrowed that either, so apparently they were doing a good job of at least getting their books to be circulating in high schoolers' hands at that time.
This book is--and I cannot stress enough that this is all you need to know--exactly what you'd expect. I also reviewed one of Chelsea Handler's books--again, read under dire circumstances, meaning it was in front of me, and I had two hours of free time--and this is very much in the same boat for me, and that's probably the most unsurprising association anyone could ever make. Could you argue that it's a clever way to capitalize on and expand your fame by milking a caricature of yourself that people either love to hate or love to indulge in, sometimes both at the same time? You could. But should you? No further questions, your honor."

The girl obviously had a lot of help writing this book because there's no way she probably even knows which direction you read a book.
I couldn't stop laughing at the summary, ""Can she help it that she was born rich or privileged."" or filled with fabulous colored photo's of her. Of coure Paris thought this wouldn't be a book without pictures of herself.
This book is a joke , you can probably read it for a good laugh but other than that it's just a waste of time. I rather read a book that I'd gain and benefit from after reading it instead of reading a whole 192 pages about how perfect paris is and blah blah bull!"

It's very obvious when reading this how much she was the blue print for the Kardashians. It's interesting how bold Paris' voice is especially on not wearing real fur, on work and on diets/eating. Especially at a time when the culture towards women was incredibly unforgiving. She was 23 when she wrote this and very insightful, i'd love for her to write a second book now 17 (?) years on.

I worship her and give her a lot of credit but I highly doubt she wrote much of this (yes I know there is another author name on the book) but I mean the structure and ideas were probably all Paris, 5% of the written words by Paris, and the rest by the other person.

And, to give her credit, there were a couple ""gems"" of good advice/quotes in there. Including: ""Eat as much chocolate as you can. Chocolate seems sinful, and therefore makes you happy.""

Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,Eva-Marie,"June 28, 2009",2.0,"Well, I've finished it. I'm scared though- I think I may have lost a few brain cells during the course of the book. I use the word 'book' loosely also.
I like Paris. I'm not a huge fan, I don't watch her (or anyone else for that matter) on t.v., and I'm not jealous of her. But I do like her. I think she gets a bad rap most of the time. Any one of us makes a sex tape and no one cares. She does it and the whole world looks on and has comments. It's, in a way, her fault the world is looking on yes, but that doesn't make it right in my eyes. It doesn't make it right to be overly harsh on someone for reasons like the medias.
I'm going to assume this was written in humor. The so called advice and heiress tips she gives can't be anything but. There is a little part of me, admittedly, that is scared she's serious but the rest of my brain cells, the ones still in good working order, are telling me that's just not that possible.
This is more like a photo album too. There is a decent amount of text on almost each page, with the exception of a few full photo pages, it's not like a few people said abotu being mostly pictures with only captions. It's mostly pictures, yes. But there is a ""books worth"" of text in my opinion.

Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,Lisa,"November 1, 2007",3.0,"Indulgent, overstated and unabashedly self promotional, Hilton provides explicit guidelines on becoming an heiress while including hundreds of glossy photographs which could only be appreciated by the most insincere fanatic. While breezing through the shiny images and bullet pointed text, it's difficult to interpret a tone of irony or an honest voice that is mistakenly heard as sardonic. The majority of Hilton's autobiography is packed with lengthy lists of favorite vacation destinations, gems of little known Paris trivia and guilty pleasures. Regardless, the much talked about heiress surely satisfies our fierce if not slightly perverse craving of embarrassing pictures and humiliatingly obtuse intelligence. If all else fails, take Hilton's surefire advice, ""…always act like you're wearing an invisible crown. I do. And it's always worked for me."""

Melanie's Marvelous Measles,"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies","February 11, 2015",1.0,"The ignorance is astounding.

Once upon a time, vaccines saved people. Back in the Dark Ages (meaning the time before iPhones), people were dying in droves of smallpox, measles, influenza, polio.

And then some dude named Jenner (not the one who's stepfather to the Kardashians, FYI) abused some poor cows, invented the cowpox virus and lo and behold, we haz a vaccine! Fewer people died. The method became refined. We developed more vaccines for other illnesses. People now lived to die of diabeetus, heart disease, and drug use instead of an early, untimely death at age 8.

Well, 8 pretty old back then, before the time of iPhones. You were probably a spinster if you weren't a grandmother by 14. But that's beside the point. The point was that, . Take that, bitches.

So now, in the Golden Age of iPhones, somehow we've gone fucking backwards in time. People somehow have this idea that vaccines cause autism. Vaccines will give you cancer. Vaccines make your stupid little fucking children go hyperactive like they've just eaten an entire bag of chocolate.

Which they probably have.

But no, VACCINES! VACCINES! Blame the fucking vaccines! Thanks to those who refuse vaccines to their children, we've gone backwards. Polio is now a thing again! Imagine that! An illness which we almost thoroughly eradicated is now a problem. And now measley, Weasley (sorry, low blow) kids are infecting everyone else and killing other kids in the process.

So yeah. Shame on you. Shame on your ignorance. Shame on your obstinacy. Because science, motherfucker. Is the .0002% possibility that your children might, possibly, perhaps, perchance to dream, develop autism enough for you to risk an entire fucking community of other children with families that love them?

Shame. For shame."

____________________

The only people who can afford to be blasé, sanguine even, about vaccinations are middle-class people who live in areas where just about everyone else is vaccinated so there isn't a large enough pool of unvaccinated people to sustain an epidemic of a disease. Even if their child gets it, they can afford the best of medical care and neither measles nor chickenpox are major killers among this demographic. If they were from a poorer part of the world where there was little if any medical care, drugs, or even clean water, then the outcome for their children would not necessarily be an optimistic one.

Should these vaccination nay-sayers live in an area of socially irresponsible people who have all gone for the idea of not vaccinating their kids, then what you get is an outbreak like in a very small area of Wales in 2013 where over a space of 6 months 1,219 children suffered, and a man died. Why would you put your kid through that kind of pain, itchiness, sore eyes, feeling worse than the worst kind of flu? Why would you do that?

Because if you vaccinate your children they will become autistic or something else that is an urban legend that just won't die despite endless publicity, court cases and proof. Not that proof, or facts of any kind, have ever got in the way of a good conspiracy theory. And that's what it comes down to. The pernicious Andrew Wakefield, a disgraced former doctor who was struck off the medical register for damning the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination and linking it to autism because a) he was paid to do this research to prove this and b) he wanted to launch his own vaccination, which would have made him very wealthy.

But it won't die, his faked research, to some people it is a proven fact that vaccinations cause autism and despite all evidence to the contrary is true, just as David Icke believes that giant lizards rule the world
and Scientologists think aliens arrived on earth 75 billion years ago in exact duplicates of B-58 bombers. If people want to believe they are going to... But these beliefs do not harm people and not vaccinating children is child abuse, it is harming them.

I had measles, mumps and chicken pox when I was young. They were all awful. My brother and I always had them together. Our bedrooms were at opposite ends of the house, upstairs, connected by a not very long winding corridor. My mother would sit on a chair in the middle belting out stories at the top of her voice so we could both hear her. I remember the utter misery, pain, fever and terrible itching with the measles, I wouldn't subject a kid to that.

Evil book. Misguided author. 1 star, and not a golden, shiny one, but an inflamed red, leaking pus and pimply one for her."

Irresponsible tripe aimed at children. Measles is no laughing matter. Vaccination has helped wipe out many childhood diseases that decimated populations. How soon we forget.

Melanie's Marvelous Measles,David,"February 10, 2015",1.0,"Stephanie Messenger has written an anti-vaxxer book that would be funny if it wasn't so socially irresponsible.

The story features five children: Melanie, Jared, and Sam, who are vaccinated, and Tina and Travis, who are not.

The plot is simple: Melanie gets the measles (which don't seem to bother her a bit), and Tina visits in hopes of catching them (which proves impossible, because of Tina's healthy diet).

The two children identified as unvaccinated don't catch the measles, but they wish they had, because it's apparently beneficial. Two of the three vaccinated children become infected. The third vaccinated child (Sam) escapes infection, though this is lucky, because he has a ""weak immune system now"" which is ""probably because of the [vaccination] shots"" which made him ""so very sick"".

Here's a few excerpts:

p20: ""For most children it is a good thing to get measles,"" Tina's mother reassured her. ""Many wise people believe measles make the body stronger and more mature for the future,"" she concluded.

p24: ""Can we go and visit Melanie so I can catch her measles?"" Tina asked. ""That sounds like a great idea,"" laughed Tina's mother.

p28: ""I read that if your body has plenty of vitamin A, you won't get measles""

p32: Tina and her mother waited for Tina to get the measles too, but it didn't happen. Her mother said it was because her immune system was in good condition because she eats lots of fresh, raw food

p34: Jared did get the measles. Tina was not surprised really as she knew he ate so many sweets and chips every day.

p36: ""Maybe I'll be lucky enough to catch measles next time someone we know has them!"" exclaimed Tina.

The most distressing aspect of this book is its title ""Melanie's Marvelous Measles"", which is clearly a reference to Roald Dahl's ""George's Marvelous Medicine"". This is in incredibly bad taste, given that Dahl's 7 year old daughter Olivia died from measles when it progressed into encephalitis.

But by all means, sentence your children & possibly countless others to death because you're an idiot. Measles is an AIRBORNE disease for Christ's sake.

Melanie's Marvelous Measles,M.M. Strawberry Library & Reviews,"October 26, 2017",1.0,"The sheer wtfery of this book is just so stupefying that I can barely comprehend it. Marvelous measles? There's nothing marvelous about a disease that not only can kill people through its course, but leaves survivors with all kinds of potential lifelong damage. That's why vaccines exist - so that people don't have to die or suffer from horrible diseases like measles or polio.

The story in this book is just bonkers. Sheer bonkers. Melanie has measles but things are going to be awwright because she eats fruits and vegetables. Yeah, I know a healthy diet is good for you, but if a healthy diet was all that was needed to prevent disease, then we'd have an instant cure/preventative for all these horrible diseases.

Also, this book conveys the message that even if you're vaccinated, you'll still get sick, as there is one boy (Melanie's friend) who was vaccinated, but still got measles, and suffered terribly from it while Melanie bounced back from her own measles.

I know that the immune system needs a workout now and then to keep it in good order, but that's for smaller things, like a common cold or flu (although complications still can arise from these) not for more serious things like measles. I'd rather deal with the low fever and achy arm I got from my tetanus vax, then the actual full-on lockjaw itself.

This book really is good for nothing more than lulz and showing the ignorance of anti-vaxxets."

I cannot believe that any publisher would allow this to go through their business. To honestly believe that a child should not get vaccines is not only ignorant, but it puts so many more children at risk than just yours. No, children do not like getting shots, and sometimes there are adverse effects to vaccines, but none that are so terribly serious that you shouldn't even bother with getting the vaccines in the first place. Stupidity and ignorance is the reason why it's so hard to wipe out so many illnesses. If you are a parent, do your child and countless others a favor and get the fucking vaccinations.

Melanie's Marvelous Measles,Robin,"February 12, 2015",1.0,"It is rare that I advocate rating or writing a review on a book that I have not read, but the entire premise of this book, that measles are safe and healthy is so deluded and dangerous to society and so ignorant of the dangers and history of this disease that it requires that I add my voice to this. Measles is a deadly disease and millions of lives have been saved by making this a standard vaccine. We have done such a good job of eradicating this and other diseases that just 100 years ago ravaged the world, leaving parents mourning their dead children. It is really sad that people are so ignorant of history that they would advocate not vaccinating children to save their lives. The author claims to have lost a child due to the vaccination itself. If true that is still a couple of orders of magnitude more rare than death and disability from the diseases we vaccinate against. Polio still ravages other parts of the world. Whooping Cough is back and as deadly as ever. There is no reason why these diseases should be a danger to any of our children and in most parts of the world they eagerly wait for vaccines because the parents remember all too well those who have died from the disease. But I guess, since the typical modern westerner doesn't know anyone who has ever had these diseases, they think they are safe and healthy and natural. The ignorance of that viewpoint will lead to epidemics and deaths."

Topics include outrage, trying to wrap our minds around anti-vax logic, and a description of the ""illustrations"" in this thing.

I don't know who the hell decided this was a good idea to publish this, but I guess it goes under freedom of speech, right?

That said, WTF??? You cannot be serious. What the heck is Marvelous about Measles? Measles can kill. Measles can leave you deaf. Measles can damage your brain. Measles can ruin your life. If you can get vaccinated, you SHOULD get vaccinated. You know why Polio is back in first world countries? Because of stupid people like this.

""Oh I don't want to get my child vaccinated because it causes autism."" Have you actually bothered doing any research? Or did you just google it and click on the first link? All of those reports claiming vaccines are causing autism and mercury poisoning and whatever else have actually been discredited. ALL OF THEM! You are putting your children AND OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN in danger. You could kill someone! Could you be responsible for the deaths of multiple someones!

""Vaccinations are ineffective"" my ass. Someone should knock some sense into anyone who thinks that.

We should be like France, or Hungary and make it mandatory. Oh, you want to take your child to the park, gotta have their vaccines! Oh you want to enroll your kid in school, are they vaccinated? No. Get out of our building and get them vaccinated NOW!!! No vaccine, your kid lives in the bubble that is your house until the courts make you get them vaccinated.

Thumbed through it at Barnes & Noble. How insulting for an heiress to compile a list of sentiments from other people and call it an instruction book for working women.
The idea that she can be inspiring or motivating is absurd and I can't imagine who would plunk down $25 for this simplistic, disingenuous, cut 'n' paste tripe.
Really!? An American ""aristocrat"" who can snap her fingers or ring a bell to have anything done for her (including raise her kids), has advice for the ""everywoman.""
She has zero relatability to women who actually work for a living.
And this has been done before and much better. There is nothing new or original. ""Becky"" from down the street could have put this together and no one would even know about it, but because it has a Trump brand on it, the publishing world thinks this is marketable and remarkable.
Doesn't she have enough things to go laughing all the way to the bank for. And she probably had some intern do all the research and selection. She probably did nothing, just as she probably has zero to do with her so-called ""fashion line.""
And the worst is including the Toni Morrison ""Beloved"" quote where Ivanka thinks pre-Civil War slavery is akin to modern-day women being a ""slave"" to their ""first world"" problems and time and schedule constraints.

Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Christine PNW,"May 4, 2017",,"This is really nothing more than my unedited ramblings that someone like Ivanka Trump had the temerity to publish a book called ""Rewriting the Rules for Success.""

Honey, you didn't ""rewrite"" anything. In order to need to rewrite the rules for success, that would imply that some sort of rules actually applied to you. Au contraire - you've never been subject to ""rules"" in your entire life. A better title for this book would be ""Billionaire Daughters Who Benefit: Suspending, Evading and Transcending The Rules Via Nepotism, Entitlement and Privilege.""

There can be nothing that this woman could possibly say that would be relevant to anyone other than herself, or possibly the other gilded daughters born of platinum vaginas into unimaginable privilege.

It's genuinely hard to be a woman who works. Hell, it's hard to be a person who works. Our society isn't great at supporting families. Ivanka Trump's despicable father and the rest of the Republican leadership is trying to make this worse. That makes the publication of this book an even greater affront to women who work. And women who don't work. And men. Human beings, actually.

Ivanka Trump is the diet coke member of the Trump family - she's sparkly, full of fake sugar and empty calories and is attractively packaged. Fundamentally, though, she is entirely substance free."
Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Diane Yannick,"May 8, 2017",1.0,"In order to rate this book I have to admit that I read it. Not easy to do but there you have it. What Ivanka has managed to do successfully is write the textbook for white entitlement. Yet, she doesn't have any idea because she simply loves her own repetitive, cliched voice. She hasn't the slightest notion that she isn't speaking to a captive audience enthralled with every morsel that comes out of her golden mouth.

It's all about women ""architecting"" their own lives. The use of that word is as far outside the box as she ventures. Mostly she relies on trite platitudes. Here are just a few of the multitudes. Create your best version of yourself. You only get one life to live and it's up to us how to live it to the fullest. Life is a marathon, not a sprint. We need to work smarter not harder. Optimists cope better in high-stress situations. Above all, be authentic. While you're at it, be present.

She quotes 127 people living and dead in this 256 page book. Since 74 pages are references, make that 127 people quoted in 182 pages of text. I made a list of the people she quotes. Obsessive, for sure. If your intern googles working women, lays out the quotes for you, then you redundantly summarize their words and throw in a few tidbits about your family and your many successful businesses, have you written a book? There are spots where a single person is quoted for three pages at a shot. Sometimes the people she's quoting quote other people. Elizabeth Cronise McLaughlin wins the prize for being the most extensively quoted. So much so that I think she should have been given credit as a co-author. Several times she restates verbatim quotes. Once she even wrote, ""as I said before....."" Really, Ivanka, we didn't just all just fall off the fucking turnip truck. She misquotes John Quincy Adams but he probably doesn't care. Many of the people quoted are her friends. I didn't have time to google each one to make sure that they're all still alive.I'm sorry that she quoted people like Mark Twain, Maya Angelou, Jane Goodall, Mahatma Gandhi, FDR, Socrates, Dave Barry and Junot Diaz. They didn't deserve to be mentioned in such a piece of self promoting drivel. I don't care about the other 119.

My dear perfect Ivanka, do you realize that most women have at least some common sense and don't need to be told the obvious? Things like ""If you are breast-feeding and would like to continue, make sure you have a plan for pumping."" Really? Ladies with engorged breasts don't usually need reminders.
You should have a resume. Well, I'll be. Apologize when you're wrong. Don't gossip. Be nice. Say thank you. Be kind. Lead by example. Work hard. Stay humble. There are more but that humble one has made me nauseous so I'll move on.

You continually tout yourself ""as someone who has made it her life's mission to empower women in all aspects of their life."" Somehow this includes fashion-- apparel and fine jewelry. I have no idea how you think your sweatshop created merchandise is going to empower women. I looked at the websites. One thing that stood out for me was a reconstituted turquoise necklace for $168. Reconstituted means it's made out of chalk powder, plastic and dye. Do you really want your authentic women wearing this? Greed is not nice.

We know you're a perfect wife to your perfect husband who validates your every step as you walk down the yellow brick road holding hands. We know that your three children bring you unspeakable bliss. You get on the floor with Joseph and play cars for 20 minutes each day; you read Arabella 2 books per day; you give Theodore 2-3 bottles each day. (Hell with that breast pump, eh?) You give them spa baths that simulate rain forests. Then you watch them sleep. Unfreakingbelievable perfection abounds. Besides your regularly scheduled dates with Jared, you run together on the weekends. While running you talk about all the important issues that you didn't get to talk about during the week. Running, talking? Do you wear a cape that says

ENTITLED? Not everyone gets a call from Anna Wintour the minute they graduate from college to offer them a job at Vogue. Choosing to work in your family business must have been a tough decision for you. When visualizing your life, you see yourself seated at a long table adorned with ""beautiful bouquets of blush colored peonies"". Since you ""insist on niceness"", all your people are smiling as they think about how ""to best leverage themselves for the benefit of both her brand and The Trump Organization."" Since you pay them a competitive salary, full benefits, stipends for their cell phones, and gym memberships, their adoration radiates all the way to the fridge which contains healthy snacks for everyone. What is this talk about Alfred's? ""Vetted pros who take care of household chores and errands, freeing up your time, energy and mental space."" We need to put money in two spending accounts, and an emergency account and a curveball account?? I have a feeling you don't have to handle many curveballs, especially when you get to ""enjoy hanging out in the garden of your country home in NJ."" Arabella is only three yet ""she feels passionately about helping the homeless and children in need."" Golly, my three year old was mostly interested in twirling in her tutu. But then again, I didn't get to take her to work with me every Wednesday. She didn't have ""a kids' desk that folds out of the wall complete with treats, toys, colored pencils and markers"", followed by a mommy-daughter lunch at Trump Grill.

""Neither of my parents wanted to raise entitled children who didn't know the satisfaction of a job well done and they didn't."" Oh but I must beg to differ. I have the distinct feeling that you think this book is a job well done. Ivanka, you have NOT rewritten any rules for success, so please don't kid yourself. You have simply taken others' words and put your inane spin on them. This book flaunts your huge ego and exposes your superficiality."

She is very good at being famous, and wealthy, and being part of a business-focused family. The idea that she faces the same challenges as most working parents is laughable. Rewriting the rules for success? Is that even possible when you can afford to have other people take care of your family while you create clothing accessories that are appealing mostly because of your famous name? If Ms. Trump had been an hourly worker trying to survive on inequitable wages with little or no benefits, while paying for daycare, maybe she would have something to offer real working parents. Instead, she can dictate her imagined struggles from her ivory tower. I hope her ghostwriter made a livable wage, at least."

Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Kristen Jiannotti,"June 13, 2017",5.0,"Originally, I was not going to write a review on this book simply because I felt as though people would harass me. However, the reviews that it is currently getting are not positive, and I would like to give my opinion for those who actually don't care that she is the President's daughter.

Anybody has the reason to be skeptical of this work simply because she was raised privileged. However, she never once denies that she had resources growing up. Her mother was a developer of real estate and her father was already a mogul by the time she was born. Yes, she has money. Yes, she had connections early on, but it is about what you do with that success from the jump. She didn't even start working with her father until she gained a proper education and worked in a completely different company to gain experience. She states that she knew what the Trump Organization was like her whole life, and she wanted to know what it was like to be on the outside of it as well. She could have easily just started at the Trump Organization out of high school and learned that way, but she didn't.

Also, I hate that people are assuming that because she worked with her father and brother that she did not actually have to work. I don't know if these people have ever worked in a company before, but EVERYBODY works. The receptionists, the marketing team, the janitor, and the President/CEO WORKS! They each have different jobs to obtain, and yeah she wasn't the one bringing the coffee to the meeting, but she had to learn her job just like everybody else, and she became good at it. Really good.

Throughout her time working at the Trump Organization, she created deals for the company and negotiated her way through various projects. That is not something that you can start doing right off the bat. There is a learning curve for every job, and Ivanka teaches us not to be so afraid of taking that leap in your career. She talks about amazing women in her life that have shaped her way of thinking and could benefit us as well. Yeah, you're right, she does use a lot of quotations from other people, but she had to gather them up. She wrote them down as amazing thoughts from other people that stuck with her, and could help a young women trying to make it work in her current field.

All of the things that Ivanka talks about in this book could be beneficial to ANYBODY if they took the time to actually read it. Just ""thumbing"" through it at the bookstore is not actually giving somebody the benefit of the doubt that they actually WROTE the dang thing. She compiled thoughts, tips, life stories, and instances from her life and others that is a one-stop-shop for everything regarding Women Who Work. She's a mother of three who works tirelessly in various aspects of her life. She is an active member of society and her children's life that I think we can all be proud of. She spends mornings and nights with her children and never misses a dance recital or awards ceremony all while being at the front lines of a hateful society that just want to tear people down.

I am highly saddened that this book has an average rating of 2 stars because Ivanka Trump deserves far more than that. Whether you like her father's politics or not, she is a woman who works at amazing things, and I think we should all be grateful that she took her time to help out even one woman in her career."

Think of all the downtrodden women working in Asian sweatshops producing Ivanka-wear while reading it as well. Empowerment!"
Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Katerina,"July 17, 2017",5.0,"If you are a woman who works, you should read this book. Incredibly helpful tips on finding your career direction, finding a support network, managing a team and your own priorities effectively, and becoming a leader. It's a shame that this book may not be given a chance because of a certain man's current presidency. Let's all try to put our political leanings aside, and focus on the real mission here: women who work."
Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Ania,"January 5, 2021",4.0,"This book for me is on par with Amy Poehler's 'Yes Please' because instead of painting women as the 'victims of the patriarchy' Ivanka is honest about attitudes toward working women today, which are largely positive (in developed countries where SJWs mostly come from) but just need a little refining. For example, she clearly shows how the wage gap is a myth with information such as that women ask for raises and promotions 86% less often than their male counterparts and men apply for jobs that they’re only 60% qualified for as opposed to women who ensure that they are completely qualified first. I feel very sorry for people reviewing this or any other book without actually reading it because of who the author is. I am positive that I would enjoy this book just as much if it weren't written by Ivanka Trump, whom I respect greatly. Also I can only imagine how drastically polar the reviews would have been if this had been published before Trump's presidential campaign. It would be so refreshing for goodreads to be a platform to discuss ideas instead of a vapid popularity contest.

For one thing, sure, Ivanka Trump is beyond the conventional definition of 'privileged' (whatever arbitrary measure for that may be) but does that make her life experience any less valuable to share? I don't think so. Lessons can be learned from anyone, even murderers. Not to mention, this was never supposed to be an autobiography or a political book. It is supposed to be an inspirational self-help book that also provides insights into Ivanka's life. Everyone's always complaining that she 'only has a business because of her dad' but is she really that unique? I can think of at least two people I know off the top of my head who created their own brand by taking over their parent's so how exactly does she lose all credibility for having done the same thing? Maybe if we started evaluating individuals for their actions instead of the group to which they associate, there wouldn't be so much polarization across the globe as of late and we would recognize that there is great value in recognizing all perspectives.

She was offered the opportunity to work at Vogue but turned it down to pursue real estate. I think that takes bravery because having Anna Wintour personally call you offering you a job is pretty much winning the career lottery (because it looks good on your résumé no matter what career you're pursuing). She has other people catering to her 'every need'? Good for her. If you could afford it wouldn't you pay for a cleaning lady and a nanny too? Just like Amy Poehler has said, you're only hurting yourself by denying that you need help from anyone else to be a successful working mother. From personal experience, I can attest to the fact that if my mom was more selfish (because she's the most selfless person I know) she wouldn't have health problems and would likely take more much needed time for herself. Ivanka is inspirational to me not because I have a naive idea of her in my mind that she does everything on her own, but because she has created a successful brand and had the humility to seek help and not go at it alone cold turkey.

Now onto the book itself, she acknowledges early on her privilege when she writes, ""I consider the position I'm in to be a great responsibility and one I intend to use wisely."" She pointed out the continued attitude in society to refer to women and/or mothers who work as 'working women' when the term is not used for men who are or are not fathers, which I completely agree is outdated and unnecessary. I liked that she acknowledged the importance of entertaining disparate viewpoints so that her inner circle isn't an echo chamber (hint hint nudge nudge goodreads commenters on this book who didn't even read it). I really like her concepts of the 'extended job title' to empower women and a 'future mission statement.'

She then has a summary of the contents of each chapter at the end of the introduction which was a great way of laying everything out. I will very loosely outline them here for the people who 'don’t want to bother with the book' although there is much more valuable material if you actually care to read it:
1 – The first chapter was about identifying your passions in life and what I found as a particularly useful reminder was that passion and perseverance are more important than education and experience, something I've observed personally. She also emphasized that you must be happy before you achieve your dreams and not expect happiness after years of torturous hard work. It was quite telling for me to read that doctors in a positive mood make accurate diagnoses 19% more quickly.
2 – This was about 'making your mark' or establishing yourself in the workplace. One great point she makes that is simple but so true is that you shouldn’t be asking people questions that can be easily found online. This applies to everything from work to classrooms and from experience I would much rather find out the answers myself when I can but at the same time try not to be afraid of asking questions when it’s appropriate. I also agreed with her point that you should try not to talk about yourself for more than 30 seconds at a time if you’re not a particularly charming conversationalist; I’m not going to stand with a timer in my hand every time I talk to someone but I’ve definitely noticed that people are more interested in conversing when I go back to them often rather than giving them a presentation of a story that could have used a lot less details. There were also great tips on how to better participate in meetings, how to give presentations and how to work as a team among other things. Finally I completely agree that it’s better to treat networking as an opportunity to make friends or at least acquaintances with a small number of persons of interest rather than reaching out to as many people as possible via a superficial and transactional confrontation. Along the same lines, it was interesting to find out that people are 58% more likely to find a job opportunity through acquaintances rather than through good friends.
3 – This was about 'staking your claim' or essentially how to go about reaping the rewards from making your mark. There was helpful advice about being a leader, the hiring process and everything that comes with that along with sections about negotiation and knowing your worth. The latter was particularly useful for me because I try not to be a bossy person and sometimes have difficulty being assertive about my needs.
4 – This was about maximizing your time in a work week to make it more efficient and better reach your long-term goals. I’m naturally a very organized person to a fault so planning, making lists and having everything in its place is second nature for me but that information I can see could definitely be useful for people who live more hectic lives. I personally better appreciated the advice on which hobbies are the most beneficial and how to 'get centered' by tackling stress earliest in the day and using breathing exercises, among other tips.
5 – This chapter had to do with something I’m still trying to work on, which is the concept of joining your work with your life instead of attempting to balance them by keeping them separate. I was always told that work/life balance is the ultimate goal to happiness but Ivanka explained why this is false like this: relying on a balance to keep all obligations at peace will only result in the scale tipping because it is so sensitive (e.g. to sickness, accidents, etc.). She argues for a 'work/life fit' instead and embracing every obligation of the day as a part of your life. I agree with this because it reminds me of what Mark Manson wrote in his book, 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck,' that no matter what you choose to do in your life it will always bring problems that require work to solve. So essentially, your entire life from the second you wake up is work, which when put that way sounds very simple. I also appreciate how she actually included things women who work can do rather than placing the onus entirely on the government, although the way the American government treats working parents has been appalling for decades.
6 – The last chapter of the book was dedicated to changing the attitudes toward women who work as introduced at the beginning of the book.

Yes, there are a lot of quotes in this book and it sometimes feels more like a paraphrasing of other books I've read than its own thing but again, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that in my mind (I have read better books with a quote before every chapter) because there was great content amongst them from Ivanka. I feel that the quotes only enhance what she’s saying and flow with the information as she presents it. Maybe it's subjective, but having had to write many essays in high school using multiple quotations has definitely made me more attuned to reading material in a similar format. This isn't just a vague book of quotes; it actually outlines steps you can take to better yourself with specific examples. Also, isn't it better that she's voicing the perspectives of so many people instead of having written a book that simply drones on about herself and her accomplishments? I can only imagine the controversy that would have caused. Some of my favourite passages of hers that were not quotations from other people include:

""Women were interested in buying jewelry for themselves - and were no longer waiting for a man to do it for them.""

""One life isn't just about trying to achieve balance (it doesn't exist!) or managing blended priorities; it's about acknowledging that the priorities that exist outside of our job descriptions are just as important to us as the work we do to support ourselves and our families - and just as worthy of our time and attention.""

""No one knows what success means to someone else. I know lots of people who are outwardly successful and inwardly miserable - to me, that's not success, but that's the path they've chosen... Success to me means setting goals that feel true to who you are, not trying to live up to the arbitrary bar that society sets up for you or what anyone else thinks should matter to you.""

""We often realize that while we're waiting for our lives to begin, they already have - and they're made up of all the decisions we make, big and small, conscious or not... Honor yourself by exploring the kind of life you deserve.""

I personally was surprised by how well this was written. I don't idolize Ivanka and didn't have the highest expectations for this book but she (and her helpers likely) has presented the content in an erudite and concise fashion, which made the book enjoyable and quick to read. I also liked how she used real estate terminology in some of her advice like 'architecting a life you’ll love' and 'refering to your blueprint.' I believe this book is smart and transparent, and I recommend it to all hopeful entrepreneurs and bosses.

I do think a lot of the points in this book are simple and well-known, which is why I give it four stars but it is presented in a refreshing and organized way and I feel like I just got a good pep talk reminder on how to get my shit together. In the end however, this book delivers on its premise and is well-cited so even if a lot of the information comes from other sources, she's at least not claiming to have invented all of the concepts herself. Also, her workplace is ideal and largely unrealistic when compared to the average workplace, but there is no reason that that shouldn’t change. I work as a government summer student and we also don’t have a formal policy around being sick for example, and I think that should be the case everywhere. If we are sick we are given the option of taking the day off without pay or making up the hours through overtime. It’s something so basic that it frustrates me to read about the devastating problems most American (and Canadian) workers have to face alone.

In conclusion, this book is obviously meant to further Ivanka Trump's brand and create more customers but how exactly is that wrong? You think when Jessica Alba wrote her book she wasn't trying to market The 'Honest' Company through it? What this book isn't is a political book - it's meant to be an inspirational ode to female leaders and is even unintentionally feminist (a gender-biased cause I do not support). Ivanka herself describes this book as a guidebook for achieving success as a woman. She is however clearly aware of the problems most American workers face regarding paid leave and childcare so not being American myself, I can only hope that Ivanka will fight to push her father into enacting those policy changes necessary or at least bring about some policies that could alleviate the stress that workers face mentally and physically, and ultimately increase worker morale and efficiency. On that note, I think it’s important to remember this book was finished before Trump was elected. It’s also important to realize that how workers are treated is seemingly a simple issue but a lot more complex at its core because of the consumerist and 'on the go' culture of North America. North Americans are pushed to their limits to produce work faster, harder and better, and paradoxically this culture that we live in is what is causing so many problems in the opposite direction. That is why I personally believe that relying on statistics and outcomes from model countries in Europe for example to enact policy changes is the best way to bring about positive change. I also personally believe that next time you don't read a book, don't write a review about it. To me, this book is everything that '#Girlboss' tried to be."
Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Breakfast & Bookmarks,"May 28, 2017",5.0,Women Who Work was filled with great inside information from a business owner's point of view and what they look for in employees. This is incredibly helpful to those in job search. There was also a ton of information and advice for people.of both genders who will find it helpful if starting up a business or moving up in the corporate world.
Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Authentikate,"May 10, 2017",1.0,"Reads like a giant pat on the back of the privileged. Self-congratulatory, this collection of banal platitudes is confusing in that the author clearly doesn't know who her readers are. The vast majority of ""women who work"" could not relate to this marketing scheme cum policy position Ms. Trump espouses. For that reason, this book is tone deaf and so earnestly tone deaf I'm left wondering who the heck she thought her audience would be? The notion Ms. Trump truly understands the trials and challenges (and arguably even the successes) of ""women who work"" enough to commiserate with them (and thus, sincerely inspire them) strikes this reader as laughable. Her book, for this reason, may find a home amongst other trust fund babies celebrating their ""success"" in business but the notion it would resonate in the lives of the middle or working class is incomprehensible. The ""rules"" Trump is rewriting consists not of integrity, hard work, or even education but rather nepotism, born wealth, and generational advantages of the 1%."

I have always respected the work ethic, dialog, and classy lifestyle of Ivanka Trump. Being born into a wealthy family, she could have easily slipped into a Kardashian lifestyle, but instead took the high route and sets a phenomenal example for working women everywhere. The purpose of this books is to embrace the multidimensional lives women now lead as working mothers, and how to change the cultural stigma around working women."

Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Cory,"May 15, 2017",4.0,"She had me until the very end. The book is well written and even empowering at some points. But then she started advocating for very liberal laws. The book overall was super liberal. This makes all the negative reviews even more ironical.

I liked all the stuff she talked about until she said she wanted to use the federal government to force companies to offer benefits her company offers. Way against any of my principles.

I encourage everyone to read the book before they rate it. This book is not meant for me but I still read it before I rated it."

Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Fred,"January 7, 2018",2.0,"Women Who Work was right there on the shelf, so I took out of the library to hateread. Some of my friends asked me to review it. So...

Well I couldn't read it. I read a couple of chapters, and hateskimmed. It just isn't readable. That's just a fact. Some reviewer somewhere had a good insight which was that it's not a book meant to be reviewed by the New Yorker. It's not meant to be noticed by people who read books. It's meant to be a little blurb in Glamour Magazine. It's a pointless little blab that people like Ivanka Trump churn out so that even though they're already worth $200 million they can also suck in another couple of million in sales and reputation-burneshing, the kind of thing us plebians can only dream about. It is not, shall we say, prose that she sweated about.

What it mostly is is quotes from various books and people she, supposedly, finds inspirational. Any one of those books you could probably read instead and get more out of than this one. So it functions in part as a kind of digest, the classic lazy way to write a book.

When I came across one of the quotes I was struck by an irony. Before the irony, here is the quote (p. 18):

""As Grammy Award-winning musician and Oscar-nominated actor Will Smith says, ""I've never really viewed myself as particularly talented. Where I excel is ridiculous, sickening work ethic.... The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is: I'm not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be outworked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me. You might be all of those things. You got me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: You're getting off first, or I'm going to die. It's really that simple.""

And then Ivanka adds: ""Anyone who knows me knows that I will outwork anyone.""

Maybe this is true? But take a look: Will Smith says it and you BELIEVE it. It's a few lines, and it's worth more than her entire book. It comes across as natural and not a boast but a fact.

The second thing is that whole ""As Grammy-Award winning musician and Oscar-nominated actor"" stuff is such amateur hour writing. Yes, Ivanka Trump, we know who Will Smith is. (Perhaps those who were making diyukim in Ivanka's explanation of who Kurt Cobain was in a part of her mother's new book written by her were wrong: they were laughing at the thought that Ivana Trump's audience apparently wouldn't know who he was, but I consider the possibility that it's Ivanka who doesn't fully grasp that when your audience knows who it is, you actually don't have to explain it - or explain it only by means of what awards they have won or might have won.)

My final thought about the book is to discuss one other part. She writes about how when she was close to finishing business school at Wharton one morning she got a call at 8 am... from Anna Wintour! Maybe most students wouldn't pick up the phone at 8 am, which is a fair point in her favor, but she did. And Wintour told her that she hears that she is about to graduate, I know you like fashion, I'd like to offer you a job. And Ivanka turned her down, because real estate was her Passion since she was a little girl.

Then, Ivanka, reveals, when she told her father, he said ""I don't know, maybe you should take the job."" But, again, real estate was her passion.

This passage raises so many questions and Ivanka acknowledges none of them. Either she knows more than she is letting on or is very, very clueless.

So, let us ask them. Hello, she is graduating business school and ""likes fashion"" and fucking ANNA WINTOUR calls her up to offer her a job? Did she... apply for one? Unclear. In the plain telling of the story, no, she did not. What happened? I think everyone but Ivanka Trump understands that about-to-finish-business-school + liking-fashion not only does not = a job at Vogue, but certainly not a personal offer from Anna Wintour. Did daddy arrange to have Anna Wintour offer her a job? Did Anna Wintour yes him and call at 8 am hoping to miss Ivanka but technically fulfilling her promise to Orange Pig Man? Ivanka knows nothing about any of this, or knows, but doesn't tell us.

And then WTF is up with telling Donald and he tells her he thinks she should take it? Didn't he know that real estate development is her passion since she was a little girl? So... maybe he didn't know, because he's stupid Donald Trump. She certainly seems to think he knew, but I wonder. Or maybe he knew but because she's his little girl doesn't take that seriously, and ""she likes fashion,"" and he tries to get her hooked up with Vogue. Or maybe he knows and takes it seriously and the whole thing is a test of her, and however messed up that is, she passes it with flying colors. But we'll never know, and we'll never know if Ivanka Trump even knows.

So we're left wondering if she actually thinks being born on 3rd base is an accompishment or what. Of course you can (and she would) make the case that she is a legitimately hard worker. After all I bet a lot of heiresses don't pick up the phone at 8 am. But I digress.

The book seems full of stuff like that, also when she discusses her parenting. Even her self-deprecations (Arabella looks through cook books and picks recipes and we make them together and, hehehe, meringue is hard!) seem calculated and very guarded. She will never admit she burned the eggs.

So... like I said in the beginning, the only reason why the New Yorker would witheringly deconstruct the book, the only reason I would take it out and the only reason for this post is because the Trumps got all upitty and didn't stay in their station in America: tacky nouveau riche lightweights, with Ivanka playing the role of The One That Isn't. And that is why I have thoughts about Ivanka Trumps ""Women Who Work"" at all."
Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Astrid,"November 6, 2017",1.0,"The title implies that women (addressed as a collective) have a choice to work, indicating from the beginning that Ivanka lives in the 1950's with her father.

A privileged white woman attempts to make a book that appeals to the most materialistic of white women, I highly doubt Ivanka Trump has any idea what the term 'intersectional feminism' means. -she probably doesn't care tbh

An article by 'bitch media' references this book explicitly and all it's problematic elements (so basically, the entirety of the book).
-also a video from Ru Paul's Drag Race that features drag queens totally dragging quotes from the book -it's great, (unlike this book)."
Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Leticia,"June 21, 2017",5.0,"The lack of objectivity in them reviews of this book are absurd. There are good tips, specially for time management.

Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Kim Friant,"August 31, 2017",4.0,"I didn’t know much about Ivanka Trump until this last US election. But the more I saw and learned about her, the more I admired her. She’s beautiful, stylish, classy, and successful. She handled herself with grace and poise through the entire election process. There are a lot of people who hate Donald Trump, but even those people have to admit how admirable Ivanka is. When Jessica asked me to read Women Who Work and write a review for it, I was thrilled! I couldn’t’ wait to pick it up. And this coming from a chick who loves fiction to a fault! I don’t work, so at first I was a little hesitant about being the one to review this book. But I soon found out that there was so much more than just career advice. I started reading it and the first thing that hit me was that this book is not just about women. If anything, it’s for anyone wanting to be successful! Chapter 1, Dream Big, was downright inspirational! It wasn’t just about careers or business, it was about life in general. How to find things that you love and have a passion for and then going out and doing them. I have the tremendous privilege of being a homemaker and having a husband who is able to support that. And that frees up my time to pursue things that I love. I read more than the average person. I get to bake like crazy for the staff at the Emergency Department where Ivan works. I plan to homeschool our future children. This chapter encouraged me to undertake these things that I love and enjoy and if possible, turn them into something lucrative. Someday, I plan to open a bakery! Ivanka discusses how to stay positive in life. How to examine yourself to see what kind of purpose you want your life to have. She suggested a positivity exercise of spending 5 minutes every day writing down the positive things you’ve seen or experienced in the last 24 hours. I tried it, and even I have been more optimistic for it! It doesn’t even have to be a literal 5 minutes with a physical list. Some days I simply think, “oh yeah I have to do my positivity 5 minutes!”, I start thinking about all those constructive things, and then I forget to actually write the list. But the idea of finding the good things has actually worked! Chapter 2, Make Your Mark, was just as good. She talked about communication skills that you can use in all areas of life. How to network and gain support from colleagues and those in positions above you. I was inspired to get into volunteering in my community. Who knows the opportunities that volunteering at the library could open up for me! Chapter 3, Stake Your Claim, started getting into the actual business portion of the book. Although there wasn’t much to practically apply to my life, there was still a lot of good things to chew on. I mainly used it to look back at the jobs I previously held and tried to apply all those ideas to how I could have done things differently. This is the chapter that anyone in a leadership position should read. Many of the suggestions that she gives could be used in any business scenario. Even areas like education, where many administrators and teachers don’t consider what they do to be actual “business”, would benefit from the things Ivanka writes about. Avoiding useless meetings, negotiating raises and flex hours, etc., can be used just about anywhere. This chapter is incredibly helpful and informative about real women’s issues, mainly maternity leave and flex hours. I understand that family planning and childcare are the main things that can be disadvantageous to women who work. Ivanka gives very good, practical advice on how to deal with the business side of that. Chapter 4, Work Smarter, Not Harder, also deals in the juggling that mothers need to do in order to have children and a career. This was the chapter that I thought the entire book was going to be about. But even then, there are many strategies that everyone with a full, active lifestyle can take advantage of when having a career. This chapter is about organization and trying to have it all. Ivanka talks about prioritizing and, hopefully, how to juggle everything life throws at you successfully. Chapter 5, Tip the Scale, goes hand in hand with that prioritizing, by pointing out that you need to grasp all the good things that happen instead of working through them. Carpe Diem, especially those days with your kids that you’ll never get back. Take care of yourself and make sure that you’re “seizing meaningful moments” that you’ll be able to remember and cherish the rest of your life.
Chapter 6, Lead with Purpose, is where she lost me. Up until this point, I was all set to give this book 5 stars as a great business book. Honestly, every CEO and supervisor should read this book and take many of her suggestions to heart. But then she ruined it. Chapter 6 started in with all that over-generalizing, modern feminism, affirmative action crap. There’s an entire list of why women should be hired as executives and managers and be funded as entrepreneurs simply because they’re women and all women share the same strengths and traits. She applauds Norway for having a law that “requires at least 40% of their public boards of directors be female”. Frankly, I’m insulted. I’m more than just my lady parts and I’d like to be judged and evaluated as an individual, for my own accomplishments and qualifications. And “time and again it is proven that investing in the education and business initiatives of women and girls is one of the highest return opportunities, especially in emerging markets, where their success has a direct impact on economic growth” . . . why not instead of focusing on their gender, which I thought we were trying to discourage in society, you find out why they’re successful. What are they doing that makes them such good investments? I’ve said this in other reviews, the last thing that matters to me about someone is their gender, race, creed, or orientation. Why does any of that have to matter? Why not hire the person who is best for the job? Why not hire the person you believe has the passion and drive that will make your business successful? I know that Ivanka’s heart is in the right place, but she fell into that trap of overgeneralizing an entire group of people based on something that they have no control over and that the best way to overcome societal stereotypes is affirmative action. Anyone else see a problem here? And advocating for paid maternity, paternity, and adoption leave to be required by law, I absolutely do not agree with. 1. I don’t believe in most government regulation in business. It doesn’t work, it has never worked, and if anything, it hurts business. 2. By requiring it, instead of having employees ask for it, that requirement would discourage companies from hiring women, because of all the extra costs. This chapter kept me from giving Women Who Work a 5 star rating.
Overall, I liked this book a lot! I learned a lot from it and was inspired by it and by Ivanka. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to start their own business, anyone looking to advance their career, and to anyone in a managerial or supervisor position. And the area of business doesn’t matter. As I said, there are enough suggestions and strategies to cover a broad range of careers and ventures."
Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Christine,"February 27, 2018",5.0,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple reasons. First, I liked that she got input from a variety of sources like Covey, Sinek, and Duckworth-all leadership/business experts. She took what they had to say and made it relevant to women excelling in their fields. The other thing that really stuck with me was the section about writing a personal mission statement. I don't know why, with all of the books I've read, I had not thought of that before. She discusses how creating a mission statement that describes who I am and what I am passionate about will help me stay focused, and I agree-I think it will. Just like having written goals based on your values helps you achieve those goals, a mission statement encompasses your values as well and helps remind you that everything you do should be helping you live your values and your passion.
I found this to be an easy book to digest, but it left me with things to think about. I think it will be worth revisiting in a year or so to see where I am at that time and what other nuggets I can pick up that I may have missed the first time."

Behind the Bell,Amanda,"April 4, 2013",1.0,"Obviously, I considered not admitting on Goodreads that I read this book. But, one, I don't like to lie to Goodreads and, two, I actually feel the need to do some justice to this review. (Third, I had to ask for help to find this since it was my first time putting a book on hold at the NYPL (yes, I put it on hold) and the librarian laughed out loud at me so my literary pride was already sorely wounded. I just read Steinbeck, I swear!)

I read this book because I thought it would be funny to hear some behind the scenes SBTB gossip. There is lots of that, but it's hard to know if you can believe any of it. Instead this book made me really, crushingly sad. It's like we as America's pop culture consumers decided to conduct an experiment with a living human subject and it went really, really badly. Hmm, what happens when you take a goofy looking 12 year old and put him in a hit show for a national tv audience where his identity is based on being the constantly ridiculed butt of the joke and then surround him with hot 15 year olds who become the lusted after sex symbols for their generation? Then, let's make sure he is pigeonholed into this role that he will never escape before he hits high school.

What happens is that he it will stunt his development so he is caught in some prepubescent phase where he has no normal relationship to sex, women, friendship or family. He will be incredible crude, bitter, insecure and angry. And there won't be a good way out for him. I was simultaneously disgusted by and heartbroken for Dustin Diamond throughout this book. Aside from his obvious fury for his ex-costars, (He says he isn't sure what they are up to these days. Really? Wikipedia not working?) he has a few throwaway sentences that mention that his mom died of breast cancer when he was 19 and he no longer speaks to his father after he found out that he had blown all the money Diamond made while a minor.

The final layer of palpable tragedy to this book was the ridiculous lack of copy editing. There were constant weird line breaks, repeated paragraphs and EGREGIOUS grammar errors. Clearly, no one else even read the book before sending it off to the printer. They knew it would make its money from ex-fans, get totally panned by critics and quickly be forgotten. THEY DON'T EVEN CARE ENOUGH ABOUT HIM TO EDIT HIS BOOK. That's how happy America is to use and abuse Dustin Diamond. That's how little respect we have for him. He's just our national laughingstock. I hope he has a good therapist. I know I want one after this.

I don't recommend anyone read this book. Seriously, its pretty much weird adolescent references to his penis and boobs with some vague innuendo about other male celebrities gay affiars. (He claims not to have feelings about homosexuality one way or the other but that assertion made me laugh out loud next to his clear paranoia that anyone should think he was gay.) I do recommend that you read this great AV Club review that says what I'm trying to say better. (Or read this for a summary of the juicy parts - ). But mostly, I just recommend that we all send him an apology letter."
Behind the Bell,Nathan Rabin,"July 17, 2011",1.0,This is the life I have chosen for myself.
Behind the Bell,Stacia (the 2010 club),"September 1, 2014",1.0,"Why I read this book : In case people don't know, there's going to be an unauthorized Saved by the Bell movie coming up this Monday on Lifetime (info here). Yes, I was one of those kids who watched the show faithfully, cheesy as it was. I figured now was a good time to see if I could dig up some dirt before watching a movie about digging up dirt.

1.5 stars. I have to award an extra half point for the speculated insight on Neil Patrick Harris (whether it was true or just a theory is another story). This may be the one and only time in my life where I wish I could Facebook tag someone (Ash, come out of hiding!). But unfortunately, there was too much missed potential.

There wasn't a ton of info dished about the cast. What we did find out lead me to believe that Dustin Diamond is carrying a bit of a hard on for wanting to see his former cast mates fall on their faces.

Other than that, nothing really happened. Diamond got laid a lot. Big deal? Most celebrities can get get laid. I guess he must have felt the need to have to prove that he could, being that he was typecast as a loser for all of those years?

I will give DD some credit for being mildly funny at times. Some of his snarky observations were amusing, but a few good snippets do not make for an entire book of good recap either. Although, I have to admit that I laughed hard when Dustin recalled how the cast members all had their ""real-life"" talents or interests worked into the show (Tiffany was a former pageant queen, Mario a wrestler, etc.) and this was how Mark was recapped :









I remember that damn phone way too much.

The cast in a nutshell : Tiffani came off as easy, Lark came off as a silent weirdo, Mark Paul was not as much of a womanizer as I would have been expecting, Elizabeth was forever stuck in Tiffani's shadow, Mario was exactly how I figured, and Dustin was the biggest whore of them all.

Fin. I hope the movie is more scandalous!"
Behind the Bell,Alex,"January 25, 2011",1.0,"I didn't really want to read this, as I had heard it was terrible. And not terrible in the ""so-bad-it's-good"" variety, but just flat out awful. But, Saved By The Bell was a huge part of my life growing up, and I just couldn't resist.

To sum this book up as succinctly as possible: Dustin Diamond is a d!ck. Or excuse me, a ""douchebag"", which is his favorite word throughout this poorly edited book. (Seriously, the amount of times sentences
did
this
or entire paragraphs were repeated was ridiculous. Too broke to hire an editor?)

Dustin threw his entire cast under the bus in an effort to make himself look like the injured party. ""Mark-Paul was a douche, Mario raped women, Tiffani Amber was a slut and a bitch"". But then he goes on to say that he has slept with over 2,000 women (um yeah, I doubt that) and that he regularly patrolled Disneyland looking for a quick lay but somehow justifies this as not being the same thing that Mario or Tiffani did. He makes sure not to name any last names of girls he slept with, except for someone who worked on the show that was 20 years older than him. He makes sure to mention her last name over and over and I was thinking ""How is he going to get away with this?"" Oh and then he tells us - she died a few years ago. I guess that means it's okay to completely tarnish her name and reputation then. Disgusting.

And yes, I realize I could have just stopped reading. But it was like a train wreck I couldn't look away from. I kept wondering how he could get any worse, and then there would be a chapter about ""banging chicks"" on the set of Bayside.

All in all, Dustin just came out looking like a complete jerk. I'm not one to say if any of his allegations are true or not, but I find it telling that the rest of the cast is still friends today amidst all these stories about them screwing each other and doing drugs together. I think he's just bitter that he was treated as the weird, young friend and not invited into their ""cool circle"" and threw out whatever he could about them, lies or not.

I'm sure the cast weren't perfect angels, but some of these stories were just ridiculous. I also found it hilarious he continually commented on ""Tiffani's fat ass."" Really? What guy (or girl for that matter) in the 90s thought Kelly Kapowski was fat? These are the kinds of things he yells out about his co-stars to bring them down, and it's ridiculous statements like this that make the rest of his stories seem so contrived.

The only good things in this book are the mention of Monster Squad and Frank Zappa. But I don't think that awesome movie and that awesome musician should have their names soiled in such a crapfest as this book.

Okay I can't even believe I am still writing about this book. Ugh. I'm done."
Behind the Bell,Michelle,"September 21, 2012",2.0,"I couldn't help myself. My guilty pleasure... trashy celeb bios! And it was my first one of the year! Someone sent it to me, so I decided to read it. I loved SBTB when I was younger. I heard this book was nothing but trash... but I read it anyway.

I found it to be hilarious! Dustin just complains, whines and brags through the whole book. He is a bitter, bitter man. I do believe that what he says has some truth in it. But he definately paints himself in a more favorable light, which is somewhat unbelievable.

The references to his junk, I could have gone without. And I find it sad that so many girls slept with him just to better their career. How Screech could do that for you, i'm still clueless... but hey... to each their own.

He does a lot of ranting about people who really didn't need to be mentioned. But it was celeb bio trash... so of course I enjoyed it. lol

I didn't hate the book. I didn't love the book. I read it very quickly and couldn't put it down. I wanted to, but I just couldn't look away. Believe me... I tried. His bullshit sucked me in."
Behind the Bell,Jonathan,"July 29, 2012",4.0,"Judge me, fuck you. It was funny, and I like Saved By The Bell."
Behind the Bell,Jason Pettus,"March 22, 2021",5.0,"2021 reads, #6. It was just a couple of months before the writing of this review that the world saw the cancer-caused death of troubled child actor Dustin Diamond, a sad end to a legitimately tragic life and yet one more cautionary tale about the dangers of letting children get involved in the inherently icky world of international celebrity. In the very last interview Diamond did before he died, one of the things he confessed was that he didn't write a single word of his 2009 autobiography Behind the Bell, but rather was forced by his publisher (the now out-of-business Canadian trash peddlers Transit Publishing) to sit down with a ghostwriter for a few days relating anecdotes, and then said ghostwriter went off and just made up a bunch of stuff that never happened and Transit published it without checking any of it with Diamond first. Between his death and that confession, that was just exactly enough to inspire me to check the memoir out of my local library this week, where I found a book so reprehensible as to make one wonder how it can even exist without the people being mentioned in it suing it out of existence.

To be clear, I'm too old to be nostalgic about , the children's show that first made Diamond famous -- I was already 19 when it debuted in 1988, and well into my twenties and living my adult life during the '90s when it reached its popular peak -- and so that made my reading of it problematic, because I've never actually watched a single episode of the show (nor its spinoffs, and ), so largely didn't get the references to the show's setting, events and cast that largely make up the contents of this book. Then again, you don't really need to know anything about the show to know that Diamond calling his co-star Tiffani-Amber Thiessen a whore literally on page 3 is the very definition of déclassé, and bodes bad tidings for how the rest of the book is to play out.

And indeed, this book is mostly defined by the sheer amount of piss and vinegar Diamond sprays over virtually everyone he's ever met -- Fred Savage is a ""douchenozzle;"" Neil Patrick Harris an ""asshole"" (and Ed Alonzo a closeted homosexual who was regularly having secret sex with Harris); Gary Coleman ""jaded"" and ""stuck up;"" Jeremy Jackson a ""fucking mess;"" Corey Haim and Corey Feldman insufferable pricks who considered themselves ""God's twin gifts to the Earth;"" Mark-Paul Gosselaar a spoiled, preening ""Golden Child"" who once pissed in the Playboy Mansion grotto; Mario Lopez a ""man-whore"" and ""poon hound"" with ""saggy old man boobs;"" Elizabeth Berkley a ""desperate party hound;"" Dennis Haskins a ""career predator;"" not to mention claiming that comedian Martin Lawrence once raped star Lark Voorhies without having a shred of evidence; and that the aforementioned Thiessen regularly smoked pot on set and had sex with both Gosselaar and Lopez in their dressing rooms immediately after each other. (And mind you, this is while also admitting that Thiessen's parents once selflessly let him and his pets move into their house for months to avoid a stalker.)

And it's not just outrageously negative statements that makes this book so unpleasant: at certain points in the page count, Diamond claims he has an enormous penis (or ""meat stick"" in his unfortunate particular vernacular) that Berkley was in awe of; has had sex with over 2,000 partners (all of whom he collectively apologizes to at once in the appendix, in an open letter that begins ""To all the chicks I banged before""), many of the incidents taking place on the actual sets and sometimes in his co-stars' dressing rooms; has seen every cast member of naked at one point or another; used to ""bang"" 14-year-old girls regularly during live tours (and would also buy an annual pass each year to Disneyland because it was insanely easy to get teenage girls away from their parents there and spend a half-hour fingering them in a dark back corner of the amusement park); had a full-on romantic relationship with 20-years-senior NBC vice president Linda Mancuso when he was a teenager and she was in her thirties (which she can neither confirm nor deny because of conveniently dying six years before this book was written); once received a psychic message the day before he was to meet him that Michael Jackson was a pedophile; regularly improvised lines that made the writing staff feel threatened because they were so much better than the provided script; was once given a kilo of cocaine by a Cuban drug dealer because was his daughter's favorite show; received more fan mail than any other cast member; deliberately delivered terrible performances during in an attempt to ease into adult roles after the show was over (under the justification that if his acting was deliberately over-the-top enough, producers would surely see that he was in on the joke and was actually a talented, serious actor); was the actual person who got the big-screen Hollywood version of greenlit, just to get conspiratorially screwed out of the Shaggy role due to secret machinations by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.; and was regularly propositioned by most of the show's teenage extras (and would pick out random audience members to have sex with during taping days, in the style of KISS members instructing their roadies to bring girls backstage after shows, for which he refers to himself as a ""Super Pimp"").

To be clear, Diamond is ultimately the person responsible for Diamond's adult life becoming such a mess -- no one forced him to publish this terrible book, just like no one forced him to star in an amateur adult video, or then try to monetize said video a year later, or appear in such reality shows as and , or be a between-act host at the annual Insane Clown Posse convention ""Gathering of the Juggalos,"" or start a nu-metal band called Salty the Pocketknife, or stab a guy one night inside a Wisconsin dive bar, or any of the other outrageous shenanigans that marked his post- life. But then again, it's not exactly Diamond's fault that his entire childhood was essentially stolen from him by greedy and amoral adults (including a father who spent nearly every penny Diamond made before he could turn eighteen and legally claim it), leaving him untrained and entirely unprepared for adulthood once he finished puberty and was no longer the cute little kid who owed his entire career to being a cute little kid.

He deserved better than that, and he certainly deserved better than this shoddily produced memoir by this fly-by-night company, which on top of all its other sins is filled with literally hundreds of typos and other grammatical mistakes. (At a certain point, the manuscript spells the Charles Dickens character Bob Cratchit as ""Bob Crach It,"" and on three separate occasions it refers to craft services as ""Kraft Service,"" as if all food given out on Hollywood sets is actually prepared by the Kraft corporation.) What was merely a horrible book while Diamond was alive becomes a crime against humanity now that he's dead; and no matter what kind of a human monster he was (and he was demonstrably a pretty horrible monster, make no mistake), nobody deserves the kind of hatchet job this exploitation piece does on both him and everyone he ever knew. It comes with a strong hate-read recommendation in this spirit."
Behind the Bell,Brianna (The Book Vixen),"December 21, 2018",1.0,"DNF at 56%

Why I Read this Book: I watched ‘Saved by the Bell’ growing up, so Behind the Bell definitely caught my attention.

What I Liked: The behind the scenes, day-to-day production stuff was interesting to read. This is the kind of stuff I was hoping to read about when I picked up this book, along with who was dating whom and such. I was under the impression that this was a ‘tell all’ book, but it was mostly Dustin complaining and whining about anyone and everyone he came into contact with during his run as Screech.

Where do I begin? There were A LOT of eye rolling moments when I was reading this book. Half the stuff in this book (of what I read) was unbelievable. That’s not to say it didn’t happen, but I questioned a lot of what I read. I’m sure there is some truth in there, but there’s also some exaggerations as well. I was left wondering how much of what I read was fact and how much was fabricated. Then, when I was 56% into the book, I decided to do a little digging online. I came across a snippet from where Dustin says that this book was ghost written; that he talked to a guy (the ghost writer) a few times. At that point, I didn’t want to waste any more of my time reading this book. I was hoping for SBTB memories and stories about his cast mates, not fabricated tales you can’t decipher from the actual truth. (Which is why I categorized this book as ‘entertainment’ as opposed to ‘nonfiction’.)

Dustin gives himself too much credit, like when he credits himself to helping Mark-Paul Gosselaar with his lines, and thus landing the role of Zack. How he (Dustin) “received the most fan mail”. Or when he does give praise to his fellow cast mates, he has to one up them:

Dustin also mentions his “humongous dong” a few times, and clearly he wants to make sure you don’t forget that “not-so-little” tidbit of information. And there’s his sexcapades at Disneyland. He brags not only about the size of his penis, but about how many people he’s slept with and where: and And he had the audacity to call Tiffani-Amber Thiessen a slut and Mario Lopez a man-whore? Ha!

One part that really shouldn’t have been in the book (and I don’t even know if this is even fact or fiction) was his relationship with the then NBC vice-president, which started (at least the kissing part) when he was a minor (she was 18 years his senior). I don’t care if this is true or not, what really bothered me was that he was publicizing this after the woman died. So she has no way of telling her side or denying it or whatever. He says Why speak of this now, after she has passed on and can’t respond to his accusations?

And lastly, there was one section, The Sniper, about Dustin and his cats that didn’t belong in this book. It had nothing to do with SBTB.

Dustin comes off as whiny, bitter, and jealous. He says in the book but that’s what this book essentially is – a pity party of one. If I were to compare Behind the Bell to celebrity gossip rags, I’d say it read like Star magazine – lots of claims from unreliable sources that are hit or miss and you don’t know what to believe."
Behind the Bell,Grace,"November 27, 2009",1.0,"I admit it. I was incredibly apprehensive about reading Dustin Diamond's expose about what really went on behind the scenes of Saved By The Bell. I am a huge SBTB fan. I watch the show every morning while I'm getting ready for work. I own the DVDs and I even have a manilla envelope of posters, magazine interviews, and other random cast paraphernalia I saved from my the height of my love in middle school. When I found out that Screech penned a memoir that supposedly dished all the dirt, well, I was angry. I didn't want to read it for fear that it would taint my almost lifelong love for the show. I figured the book was Dustin Diamond's method of retaliation for 1) being on a show with kids two to three years older than him and when he's 12 and everyone else is 15 or 16 - that's a big age gap and it's hard to overcome or 2) he's broke again and if he learned one thing out on the comedy circuit, it was that people came to see Screech and find out more about the show, not to see his comedy act so he thought he'd just cash in.

My fears were unwarranted. The 'juiciest' cast details (i.e. Mario's rape cover up, Mark Paul taking steroids, and Tiffani Amber being a Queen Bee whore) were all used in the promotion of the book - Dustin's interviews with the press and him reading excerpts for internet videos. The rest of the book details his sexual exploits, drug use, and how naive he was that people took advantage of him. Diamond claims he's slept with over 2,000 women. Really? I know that people will jump into the sack to get ahead, but 2,000 women really slept with Dustin Diamond? Really? I'm afraid for the future of our society if that's how low some (well, a reported 2,000) women will go to get ahead. I don't care about the first time Dustin smoked weed or how he showed up to a press junket incredibly hungover. And I certainly didn't expect a chapter on how he trolled Disneyland for 'poon' or whatever lame, hasn't been used in over a decade slang term for a woman's vagina he chose to use.

Dustin Diamond used his roll on Saved by the Bell to sell books about himself. I think he feels slighted by the cast and executives of SBTB because he wasn't the 'Golden Child' even though he got more fan mail than any other cast member (over 7,000 letters per week!). According to our insightful and oh so knowledgeable narrator, SBTB fans were tired of the same old story lines and didn't want anymore story lines about Zack and Kelly, especially the College Years. Diamond even complained about how the Wedding in Las Vegas was all about Zack and Kelly. Hello?! Everyone wants to see Zack and Kelly live happily ever after. Get over yourself, Screech. It's not all about you!

So, in retaliation, he babbles on about a few random behind the scenes anecdotes, spends several chapters detailing how childhood fame turned him into a sleaseball (but he's thankful he never got an STD!), and then uses the rest of the book to name drop and bash other celebrities. Dustin, what the heck did Neil Patrick Harris and Ed Alonzo ever do to you, huh?

*shaking my head* If you feel so inclined to read this mindless drivel for yourself or you're just out to punish yourself, take note that this is a quick read. I read it in a few hours. I'm not sure why I kept reading. It was like a bad car accident. You can't put look and keep looking... At least I can say I read it and that it wasn't all it was promoted to be. It isn't an expose, but a memoir of a spoiled child star who thinks he deserves more."
Behind the Bell,Kelly Rice,"July 12, 2014",1.0,"23 Word Review:

Holden Caulfield grows up and writes a book. Actually it’s Screech and it’s not much of a book. Best suited for MST3K fans.

----------------------------------------------------------

Diamond’s book is less of an expose and more of a modern day Catcher in the Rye. Diamond fits into the role of a grown up Holden Caulfield quite well. He’s angry, embittered and surrounded by a world full of posers, losers and dirty dirty fakes. He, of course, rises above it all, watching on with an air of self-righteous superiority as everyone else goes about their grubby little lives. That doesn’t mean Diamond is above the same behavior that leads him to label Mario Lopez a ‘man whore’. Lopez – along with every other cast member aside from Dennis Haskins (aka Mr. Belding) – is described only briefly and treated as a bit actor in the story of Dustin Diamond’s reign of ‘Saved By The Bell’.

Throughout the book, Diamond inadvertently paints himself as a sniveling, embittered, petty narcissist which, again, dovetails perfectly with the profile of a grown up version of Salinger’s anti-hero Holden Caulfield. The stories Diamond shares are so obnoxiously over the top, they beggar belief. He brags about how many “chicks I’ve banged” on nearly every page. His exploits seem to have started right out of the gate, apparently thanks to his “monster wang” which he refers to no less than a dozen times throughout the book. He focuses so intently on what a ladies man he was that it borders on the towns of Absurdville and Desperation Row.

While Dustin doesn’t seem too interested in giving up the details on his cast members, he was clearly a bit desperate to fill the 311 large font, widely kerned pages which make up the book. He includes the entire prime time line up circa 1992 and, towards the end, entire paragraphs are reprinted right one after each other. This might have been done by the publisher in a desperate attempt to stretch out the already thin material just a little more but it just as easily could have been the result the editors just not noticing because, I gotta be honest, this isn’t an easy book to finish.

When it comes to the crew who managed to get SBTB on the air every week, Diamond goes back and forth between what seems to be a genuine respect for their work and seeing them as little more than props. He recounts the details of camera placement and screen snaps for several pages but, when he gets to the color-key work done he sums it up by telling his readers “There’s probably some elaborate technical reason [behind the job of color-keying] …. But I have no idea what that undoubtedly excellent reason might be.” Clearly, he also couldn’t be bothered to look it up.

Diamond wants to be seen as a nice guy stuck in an awful world, forced into situations that left him jaded, potentially spoiled by youthful fame and fortune, but still a nice guy at heart. Sadly, he succeeds only at sounding like a whining, self-important prick. He tells a story about having been wronged by an extra. She insulted him in front of the rest of the cast and, to retaliate, he allegedly stole her purse and pissed in it while she was having lunch. Because, you know, every girl leaves her purse behind in a common area where anyone could take it when she leaves for lunch during the work day.

That TOTALLY happens.

One of his more ludicrous claims is that he carried on and off-and-on sexual affair with Linda Mancuso who was, at that time, VP of children’s programming at NBC. Like many of his tall tales, the story begins almost believably – with a building sexual tension that is almost-maybe-if-you’ve-had-a-few-to-drink-kinda-sorta believable. But then things take on the air of a late name Skinemax movie. In an unspecified year (Diamond is almost deliberately vague on his timelines) several members of the cast and crew, including Diamond and Mancuso, were flown to an appearance in New York. One evening, Diamond saunters down the hall to Linda’s room. Inside, her mother is asleep in an adjoining room and she and a friend are sitting on the couch drinking wine and watching soft core porn. I shit you not – that is seriously his story. The friend apparently offers a giggly excuse and leaves the room, leaving Dustin and Linda alone. After a brief make-out session, Dustin leaves and the affair kicks off in full steam some time later. He claims the affair carried on for years and until they simply (and discretely) “drifted apart.” Some time later, Linda was diagnosed with cancer and passed away in 2003. Diamond admits he didn’t attend her funeral and, for the reader, the entire story bears a striking resemblance to those boastful tales heard on the playground about a girlfriend (or boyfriend) a classmate has totally gone to third base with. But you wouldn’t know them … they live in Canada. Or it happened at Summer Camp.

In its own way, Behind the Bell a tragic tale and readers are likely to finish the book feel a small amount of pity for Diamond. Then, however, they’ll turn the page to find he has included three appendices to the book

• A Saved by the Bell Drinking Game (created by someone else)
• To All the Chicks I Banged Before: An Open Letter
• A Fan’s Top Episodes

This final appendix will erase any shred of sympathy you may still be clinging on to desperately. Dustin’s admittedly “very unofficial” list includes 12 forgettable episodes meant to be a collection of “fan favorites”. Missing from his list is the single most memorable episode in the history of the series, “Jessie’s Song” which featured the infamous ‘I’m so excited” clip. He could have picked any 11 other Screech-centric episodes for his list, but when you’re making a fan favorite list, it might be a good idea to actually include an episode the fans have proven they love even 20 years after Bayside High closed its doors for good.

After finishing Diamond’s memoir of his time on SBTB, I have to wonder if he may be have provided the real life inspiration for Kenny Powers. The irony in this book is that being a part of a long running television show like SBTB is an impressive accomplishment. Diamond has every right to be proud of what he, his cast mates and the crew managed to accomplish over the 10 years the show was on the air. The way he tells his story, however, diminishes his accomplishments. In the end, Behind the Bell is little more than the incessant inner dialogue of a narcissist the world has forgotten."
Behind the Bell,juicy brained intellectual,"November 15, 2020",,"this is easily one of the worst books ive read this year maybe ever but i can no longer quantify time like that so i dont feel comfortable making that claim. whether this was ghostwritten or from the man himself behind the bell clearly came from the mind of a demon sent to terrorize planet earth with long turgid descriptions of the quality of breasts and sex but mostly it reads like a horny 14 y/o virgin wrote it so maybe dustin caught arrested development from shooting to tv fame at such a young age or he found a child to write this book for him. who can say! i suggest this book for those who like to see such clever turns of phrase as ""melonesque gazungas"" or ""bulletproof knobs"" there are any number of disturbing euphemisms for tiddy and they are all repulsive and truly reek of infantile misogyny like brooooooooooooooo u never ""disneyfingered"" (fingering someone at disney) anyone!! i can excuse poor writing because i am braindead but i cannot handle this shit especially in excess. a truly miserable book FDBD (for demons by demons)!"
Behind the Bell,Dolly,"January 12, 2015",2.0,"As a former extra, (hopefully one that never got my purse violated)...I really enjoyed reading a lot of this. His account gave so many nuances of what it was like to be backstage. It was very. interesting. I think if he'd taken a cue from SBTB producer Peter Engel and edited the book to be ""fit for family,"" his story would have been much better received. The one star ratings dissuaded me from reading it for several years and I think I only paid 99 cents for it. I wound up thoroughly entertained and enjoyed a few laugh out loud moments. I CRINGED at all the hate. In light of the lifestyle he claims for himself...the name calling was almost absurd.

Dustin did a hard job for a lot of years. I don't believe a person can work on a successful TV show for this long without a great deal of discipline, professionalism and responsibility. A lot to take on at eleven years old, I'd say. If you read between the lines you will find an intelligent and soulful person in there. I'd have liked to give both a 1 and a 5 rating rather than this average looking 3.

From my own experience I can contribute a couple of ""extra"" things, if you are bored or have insomnia like I do right now. I do not doubt Dustin's account of the things he saw...though his interpretations I believe were off at times and particularly wrong in one case.."
Behind the Bell,Don,"August 27, 2012",2.0,"What a coincidence that I would pick this book up after reading Julie Dawn Cole's saccharin I Want it Now! about her days filming Willy Wonka. This book by former Saved by the Bell (SBTB) star, Dustin Diamond, is about as close to being a complete opposite to Cole's book as one could dream up!

From the very get go, Diamond, who played the geeky Screech on SBTB tells the story of a world in which every single person is a jerk - except, or course, Diamond himself.

SPOILERS!!

Let me sum up some points for Mr. Diamond:

Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack) was a mean, entitled, prima donna who might possibly have been engaged in an elicit relationship with the show's male creator.

Mario Lopez (Slater) was an narcissistic bully and womanizer who was accused of rape and had NBC payoff the complainant.

Tiffany Amber Thiessen (Kelly) was an opportunist skank who slept her way to whatever she managed to attain.

Lark Vorhies (Lisa) was an emotionally damaged introvert who Diamond alludes to have been abused by her fiance, Martin Lawrence.

Elizabeth Berkeley (Jessie) was a lousy actress and mental midget who's main activity while on the show was to sleep with whomever Thiessen was done with.

Dennis Haskins (Mr. Belding) was a car-salesman-like opportunist who really wanted to get a lady but who scared them away (literally.)


Those are the highlights. Diamond thrashes about 98% of the people he mentions in the book, including his parents who spent all his child actor dough.

On the flip side, reading this book will let you in on a secret: Dustin Diamond is a ladys man like no other! He literally talks about his conquests being north of the 2000 women mark. He tells intimate details of an affair he had with an NBC executive in her late 30's (he was about 15 at the time) who is, regrettably, dead now, having dies of breast cancer and unable to confirm or deny his accusations. He tells stories of using Disneyland and various SBTB public appearances as dating junkets. He basically puts himself forward as the one guy who had all the right answers, knew the way things really worked, and saw everyone for what they really were.

One facet of the story that is noticeably missing is Diamond's theory as to how, given his mental and personality prowess, he has managed to do prescious little else since leaving SBTB other than:

A ""leaked"" amateur adult film.

Celebrity Fit Club 2 (where he claims he was in cahoots with the producers to liven things up by acting like a villain.)

A celebrity fight with the lat Ron Palillo, Arnold Horshack

Write a scathing tell all about his very limited perspective on Hollywood.


There are some tidbits of interesting info about the workings of the show and about child stardom in general. Overall, the book comes off like the rantings of an ego maniac who misses the fame.

Behind the Bell,Chris Gordon,"May 21, 2021",4.0,"Dustin Diamond's book is the definition of ""so bad it's good!"" This is pure, concentrated SHIT...and I loved every minute of reading it. Sometimes you need a break from the intellectually stimulating works to indulge in some world-class garbage, just to be reminded that not every book needs to be Dostoevsky or Shakespeare to be worthwhile.

I know 90% of what Dustin Diamond claims in this memoir is pulled out of his ass or exaggerated nearly to the point of absurdity (which adds to the book's unintended humor), but I knew what I was getting into prior to picking this up so it didn't negatively affect my reading. I was fully aware of Diamond's status as a bullshit artist, so I didn't care that he lied his way through these several hundred pages. In truth, that's what I came here for – to be entertained at any cost. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.

Though, for as enjoyably bad as Dustin Diamond's anecdotes and behind-the-scenes tales were, one thing kept bugging me all throughout my reading – horrendous editing. There are a litany of errors that are simply inexcusable in a publication of such high notoriety. Repeating sentences and paragraphs, mind-boggling misspellings, punctuation errors, improper syntax, and flat-out incorrect information (like wrongly referencing Uncle Fester as a character from The Munsters rather than one from The Addams' Family) plague this already trashy book. I have a feeling that whoever edited the book had a hard time taking it seriously and thus left it mostly unchecked, which I don't blame them for. Had these copious mistakes been corrected, this would be a much more tolerable reading experience, although the content would remain just as hilariously bad.

How can you not have a good time with such a slanderous, hyperbole-laden, spite-fueled hit-piece aimed at the cast of Saved by the Bell, written by Screech himself? That concept is crazy enough to warrant a read by anyone who was a fan of the show simply on those merits alone. Read it for the laughs and enjoy the shit show for all its dumb glory; don't take it too seriously or you're more likely to have a bad time."
Behind the Bell,Candice,"April 2, 2012",3.0,"This book was decent. After reading reviews I expected it to be horrible. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find I enjoyed it. Maybe the bad reviews are because people expected screech to write it...I however went in with an open mind. I was expecting for Dustin to bad mouth fellow cast mates. I expected him to tell his side and only his side, therefore probably not entirely accurate. For example, he may have seen Tiffani going in and out of Mario or mark-Paul's dressing rooms, but was he in the room with them? No, so he doesn't have proof any of those rendezvous actually took place. He is speculating. His life...? Probably accentuated in the book. He focuses on himself through the whole book making himself look like everything was about him but we all know that wasn't the case. As I mentioned I enjoyed the drama of the book and that is what it is, drama. However, the editing could have used some work. There are many spelling and grammar errors scattered through out the book, some of which caused my reading progress to pause. Thus only four stars, it could have been better written, but he did what he set out to do, to tell his own story and many people didn't like it."
Behind the Bell,Mark Noonan,"November 1, 2015",1.0,"I didn't think I was going to be able to finish this but I have to finish a book if I start reading it. I will first start off by saying that it was interesting to get some of the behind the scenes of SBTB. That being said...other than that I don't recommend this book.
Dustin Diamond has issues. His is so into himself it's ridiculous, and the fact he has to keep bringing up how big his package is, is just annoying. He actually put a letter in there apologizing to the women he took advantage of and even in that apology he's a pig!
There is also a lot of writing flaws such as repeating paragraphs, misspelling of words, and incorrect information. He also said that ""Jackie Coogan"" played Uncle Fester on ""The Munsters""...Uncle Fester was on ""The Addams Family"" you Moron!!!!
It's really up to you to read this or not. I was a huge SBTB fan so I ignored the reviews and read it anyway. I hope someone from the cast writes a biography on SBTB that isn't a load of crap.
I did read an interview where he said there was a ghost writer responsible, but I'm not sure if I buy that. I think he said a lot of things he shouldn't have and realized it after it was too late."
Behind the Bell,Cory,"January 13, 2013",1.0,"Being a big fan of SBTB and inside Hollywood gossip, I was excited to read this book. I finally received it for Christmas and finished it in a few days. It's a quick read and that's one of the few good things I can say about it. I'm not sure if I got a bad copy but my issue was full of typographical errors and repeated line printings. I'm not a grammarian but it also was poorly written for a published novel. There were few spicy tidbits that could largely be chalked up to heresay. I actually found it more interesting to read about the technical aspects of SBTB production than some of the salacious details, like how Screech used to troll Disneyland for girls. Overall, Dustin Diamond comes off as a bitter, sad individual desperate to hold onto whatever fading fame he has left regardless of the consequences or whom he hurts. Oh, and apparently he has a monster dong. He wanted to make that point very clear. Its probably a must read for super fans of SBTB but everyone else should probably pass."
Behind the Bell,Patrick,"November 17, 2009",2.0,"The only dirt to be found in 300 pages: 1. Zack did 'roids during ""The College Years (or as Screech aptly puts it, 'Semester')."" 2. Max from The Max had a gay affair with Neil ""Doogie Howser M.D."" Patrick Harris. Why would you only give literally one sentence to possibly interesting stories like playing chess with Will Smith or getting Christmas presents from Johnny Cash, and then devote entire chapters to trying to pick up chicks at Disneyland or smoking weed for the first time? At least he acknowledges how unintentionally funny the ""I'm so excited! I'm so... scared!"" scene where Jessie freaks out on caffeine pills was.

Also I forgot to mention he claims Kelly alternated banging Zack and Slater, but I think we all guessed that years ago."
Behind the Bell,Mika,"July 26, 2012",1.0,"Blows on so many levels: sloppy, all types of misogynistic/myopic/disgusting, and still manages to be BORING. Occasionally interesting for finding out about set hijinks, but Jesus Christ, NOT WORTH IT for the amount of clunky, smarmy pages in between. Skipped several chapters.

Just read other reviews, as they are more hilarious than the source. I feel like picketing his stand-up shows with a sign that says, ""THIS GUY'S BOOK SUCKS / FEMALES, DO NOT BLOW HIM LIKE HE PURPORTS YOU WILL""

Behind the Bell,Erin,"April 23, 2010",1.0,I feel dirty all over.
Behind the Bell,Mercedes Yardley,"December 7, 2020",1.0,"This was a sad, bitter book written by a sad, bitter man. It starts off by slamming the other Saved By The Bell cast while Diamond tries to paint himself as the heart and soul of the show. There's a very cool section where he explains how things worked behind-the-scenes with the writing, table reading, filming, how the lights were set up, etc. That is what interested me and was what I thought the book would mostly be about. But what we have here is am excluded kid with a victim mentality who never grew up and spends pages discussing his conquests at Disneyland and his, and I quote, ""humongous dong."" Hard pass."
Behind the Bell,Clementine,"May 11, 2012",1.0,"In Dustin Diamond’s memoir about his time as Screech on the much-mocked and much-beloved (ironically?) 80s sitcom Saved by the Bell (as well as its spin-offs), he takes a no-holds barred approach to spilling the dirt on his cast mates. Diamond recounts his days on the set with his much-older peers, his brushes with other celebrities of the day (as much as Jaleel “Urkel” White can be counted as a celebrity), and his myriad sexual encounters with women. Be prepared, readers, for you’re in for a bumpy ride.

There are so many problems with Diamond’s memoir that it’s hard to know where to start. This might be the biggest disasterpiece I’ve ever read (and I’ve read a lot of really, really crappy books). Perhaps the biggest problem is that from the onset, Diamond presents himself of the voice of authority and experience. This is even present in the book’s subtitle, which states that it goes “behind the scenes of Saved by the Bell with the guy who was there for everything.” The problem is that not only was Diamond not there for most things, but he’s clearly also delusional, or a pathological liar. That works for Diamond’s purposes, though, because the only way that readers are going to believe the contents of this book is if they are very stupid or total superfans who want to be scandalized.

The fact remains, though, that Diamond doesn’t present anything particularly scandalous or shocking, and the allegations he does make are not backed up by facts or anecdotes or even tidbits of stories. All of the alleged bad behavior that went on onset is the stuff of normal teenagerdom, and it becomes clear, early on, that Diamond wasn’t actually present for any of it. Once readers realize this, the book alternately bores and grosses out.

Diamond is incredibly bitter about his entire life, and much of his vitriol is aimed at his fellow cast members. There doesn’t seem to be any legitimate reason for Diamond’s hatred of his costars, but it’s present all the same. He takes them all to task for various reasons: Mark-Paul Gosselaar was fawned over by the producers and was thus “the Golden Child;” Mario Lopez was a womanizer who started working out too early in life; Tiffani-Amber Thiessen was a whore; etc. Particularly disturbing is Diamond’s weird obsession with Gosselaar’s heritage: more than once, he makes comments about Gosselaar’s Thai heritage that are blatantly racist. There are moments where you realize that this can’t all be true: there’s several anecdotes about Diamond playing around with Lopez and Gosselaar on set, and when he had a stalker, he lived with Thiessen and her family until the situation was handled. These things don’t add up.

If the book were being honest–if, indeed, Diamond could be honest with himself–this memoir would talk about the fact that Diamond was on a show where he was surrounded by people both older and cooler than him, and that despite his desperate desire to belong, he never did. This would be an interesting memoir: one in which Diamond is capable of being both vulnerable and self-reflective. Of course, none of that is present here, as Diamond puts on an air of smugness and weird superiority from the first line.

Instead of offering any sort of actual content, though, Diamond prefers to focus on sex. He spends a great deal of time hinting at all the sex his cast members were having with one another, but there’s no evidence to support this. There’s a fairly lengthy passage where Diamond makes the claim that he’s pretty sure both Gosselaar and Thiessen were having a threesome with producer Peter Engel in order to curry favor. In these (frankly, imagined) scenes, Diamond sits outside the office and stares at a closed door. Never is it more clear that most of–if not all–this is in his head.

This review wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t talk about Diamond’s preoccupation with sex. In the memoir, he claims to have slept with over 2,000 women, the majority of whom he picked up at Disneyworld. Diamond also repeatedly refers to his penis as “the monster in [his] trousers.” It’s not the claims that I take issue with–I don’t really care if he’s slept with that many people, and it’s certainly not my business–it’s the vulgar way he goes about describing these encounters. He talks about women he’s slept with with the kind of callousness you expect from some drunk old douche in a bar, and his disregard for them as human beings is repulsive. All of this frank discussion about sex hints at what is really going on, of course. Saved by the Bell took away his sexuality (watch an episode–any episode–of SbtB and you’ll see it immediately), and Diamond is on a mission to reassert his masculinity and sexuality. It’s gross and sad and more than a little pathetic.

This revisionist history of the cult-classic 80′s sitcom is worth skipping, even for the die-hard fan. Diamond’s recounting of his time on the show and his life afterwards is almost impossible to slog through. It’s not just his insufferable tone or the fact that he’s clearly lying: the book is not well-written and doesn’t appear to have been edited at all. Mistakes and typos abound. With nothing new to offer readers, nothing about this memoir is worth reading. Pass on it, and watch the series again instead.

Behind the Bell,Kassy Miller,"April 23, 2021",1.0,"Once I start a book I HAVE to finish. Honestly this book started out great to me! Drama, which is what I wanted.

But as the pages DRAGGED on, it was jibber jabber and alot of jumping around between time periods that's hard to keep up with.

I now know why none of his cast mates cared he was dying, which is why I picked up the book to begin with.

Don't waste your time."
Behind the Bell,Karen,"February 7, 2012",3.0,"I get just as much a kick out of reading other reviews of this book as I did reading it. Most people don’t believe Dustin Diamond’s exploits, foul mouth, big dong, strong dislike for his fellow SBTB cast mates, copious use of the word “douchebag”, the fact that he picked up chicks at Disneyland, or the fact that he banged 2,000 women. I have no problem believing any of this. I find Dustin obnoxious, yes, but I also find him refreshingly real. He is one bitter dude. I can feel it jump off the page like so many teen girls off his fingers at Disneyland. This is hilarious stuff. From the aimless ranting, topic switching, disorganized randomness to the horrific editing and many, many typos and typesetting problems to the fact that this is SCREECH we’re talking about!

Dustin spends most of the book condemning the actions of others while defending his own. It’s like he really doesn’t see that he was just as bad as he’s claiming Mark-Paul, Mario, and Tiffani Amber were. Even the few people Dustin claims to like (rather, not totally hate) he throws under the bus. There’s an odd section of the book where Dustin names other celebrities and talks about their level of douchiness. Kevin from The Wonder Years = douche. Gary Coleman = bitter (no duh). Neil Patrick Harris = gay (again, no duh). It’s such a random part of the book and has no reason being there; it’s just filler between calling Mario and Mark-Paul douchebags and calling Tiffani a whore. He also glosses over things you want to hear more about yet spends chapters and chapters on how many women he slept with and how he got high. I enjoyed hearing about the inner workings of making a TV show and wish he spent more time on that and less on trashing people which he honestly could have condensed into one or two chapters.

You know, I like Dustin’s sense of humor. His sense of entitlement… now that’s not for us to judge. It sounds like he has the right to be a little angry and it’s no wonder he carries animosity to this day. You don’t have to like SBTB to find this hilarious. That is if you enjoy train wrecks and aren’t easily offended by naughty words. This guys sounds like a trip."
Behind the Bell,Candie Paulsen,"May 20, 2016",2.0,"Overall, I'd say it wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but a lot of it was ridiculous. Throughout the book he talked about his many sexual exploits behind the scenes while playing a nerd of epic proportions on TV. But who cares? Honestly. What was it like being in such an epic TV show for so long? What were your favorite episodes? What was it like being a child actor? How was it growing up in San Jose and then moving to LA to be an actor so young? Was it hard to leave your friends? He touched on some of these things in the book, but most of it was about ""Screech"" hooking up in real life, talking very loose smack about his costars, and providing random lists of celebrities that were huge Screech fans. It felt as desperate and immature as Justin Bieber writing that Anne Frank would've been a Belieber. I read yesterday that Dustin Diamond had done an interview with Mario Lopez (AC Slater) the day before where he said that he didn't actually write this book, which has caused his fallout with the other SBTB cast members and his not being invited to participate in show reunions. Instead he says that he met with a ghost writer to write a book, but then that ghost writer went rogue and wrote the Tell All book. Maybe it's true? Maybe it's false? Saying this seven years after a book was published seems a bit late to the party, but who knows? As is, there were some interesting tidbits in this book that is buried amidst pages of complete and utterly irrelevant/uninteresting rubbish."
Behind the Bell,Dawn,"September 28, 2013",1.0,"This book was so ridiculous and a little confusing. This guy spends the entire time whining about what ""douchebags"" his cast members are. (a phrase he seems to coin all throughout the book, and I thought people stopped saying douchebag around the time the original saved by the bell went off the air) Then does the exact same thing that he claims made them such jerks in the first place but tries to play it off like if he does it it's okay. They were all drinking and doing drugs and having sex with everything with a pulse and I think this guy was just pissed cause he had to get drunk and high and pick up promiscuous teenage runaways all by himself. I'm also a little confused about his reference to the child actor who he says played Uncle Fester on the 60's show the Munsters. This was before my time but I don't remember an Uncle Fester from the Munster, I do recall one from the Addams Family. If I'm wrong please let me know. I also noticed numerous typos and an entire paragraph that repeats itself. I think this author should spend less time talking about his supposedly (huge) privates and more time finding a better editor."

Behind the Bell,Mike Pemby,"January 25, 2021",,"I found this to be a very fascinating. (I know you are thinking I am joking)
If you are looking for the behind the scenes of Saved By The Bell and that's all your really interested in, yeah the book's not half as scandalous as rumored. Most of the claims are also things he now claims are made up by the Ghostwriter, of who he never seems to say who that was. I have no idea why there has not been anyone asking the publisher to give a comment or to look at the publishers other books to see if maybe there is a real issue with them doing this to people. I find the fact that he didn't denounce the book immediately as being fabricated and not what he told to the ghostwriter pretty telling. II think he said all of the claims or pretty close to that.

Here's why, I found it fascinating. There is so much pain and anger in this book
I do think that the publisher is at fault for just printing the book without changing names of private people or verifying in any way claims. I don't understand how no one mentions he claims the woman who was head of children's programming, had an ongoing sexual affair with him starting at 12 or 13. Now if he were talking about this as an abuse allegation and wanted to say ""this happened"" I totally understand. He actually speaks of this as a wonderful thing and he seems to have a lot of care for her. Yet, he must know how that will read to the public and would make her seem as though she sexually abused a preteen and makes you wonder, was this the only time? She died before the book was written and the fact that he doesn't seem to care that he's labeled her a child sex offender is fascinating. Not one source out there covers this part of the book. So I know very little about the real story. I just know she had that position and she dead from cancer.

There is a great deal of unfairness that he talks about. You can feel the anger and frustration he has that all of the other cast mates had great careers and he's tried over and over to continue acting and it's not worked. It's a very fun unreliable narrator situation. I read most auto biographies with the understanding that the writer has a certain perception of themselves they are portraying, they usually are written with a ghostwriter whos made the events more interesting to read, and most importantly that ones perception of events doesn't mean that things went down that way. No one remembers all the things they see exactly as they happen. I find it weird that many people do believe every word in a autobiography is an accurate account and not a biased perspective or accounts. Doesn't mean its all fabricated just means you have to do some brain work. The book isnt a hard book to read and i think I read it in spurts over about a week.

He seems to have had some unfair blows. Although, he doesn't seem to realize how much he did get. He had a hit part on a hit TV show as a character that EVERYONE remembers about that show. He was also on the show for about an additional 6 years after the main cast left. That's a pretty impressive thing that I know I would love to say is part of my past. Showbusiness is really a hard business and by no means should he have seen himself as a failed child star. He unfortunately dwelled on that and couldn't find a new path from there. I think his cancer diagnosis is such a shame. Although, it makes for a tragic ending for his story which is what he would want if it were in the book. Not being cold, I'm saying that's how the book shows he sees his life. That is sad.

I met Dustin when I was 13 at Disneyland when he would hangout there. I was on a family trip he hung out there regularly. As a teen ager I started going to the park much more frequently and once when I was in the park after I auditioned for the parades I hung out with him and some of his friends. I also have a friend connection to this book which his recount of her is actually quite off and since she is not a public figure, it left a weird taste in my mouth."
Behind the Bell,James Carter,"December 18, 2021",4.0,"I became interested in reading Behind the Bell that was written by Dustin Diamond for three reasons: my interest and curiosity in the scandals that went on with the cast of Saved by the Bell, the poor scathing reviews of the book, and the need for a quick read.

All three are fulfilled, but I am actually more surprised by Dustin Diamond's writing. Despite the poor editing in spots, he writes vividly well. There's a lot of tell-all gossip, but after a hundred of pages or so, it becomes less and less as Dustin starts to talk more and more about his sexploits in the aim of getting some street cred or whatever.

Plenty of information is provided about the daily routine and what went on during the show and how the episodes were set up. It's very interesting, I must say. Then, Dustin uses his sincere honesty about the rough world of Hollywood and how things are the way they are. He does provide some interesting tidbits about his castmates, but they aren't very much. I like the fact that he rated some famous people if they were worth meeting or not. Pleasantly surprised, he thought less of Fred Savage and Neil Patrick Harris, two child stars whom I hated watching during the 90s.

Whoever grew up in these times and also most of the 80's as kids will fondly remember the days of watching these television shows, and was a major part of it. Moreover, I am actually surprised where has its origins from which makes sense to me and explains why it was an addicting show in a subconscious way. I never realized that Screech's on-screen girlfriend was Tori Spelling.

Until this book, I never knew Mark-Paul Gosselaar bleached his hair yellow although I was puzzled for years about why it was so reddish brown. Of the show's characters, I didn't dislike Screech, but Lisa Tuttle was the one I hated the most not because she was black but because of her constant hatred of Screech and her one-dimensional personality. Her being allergic to Screech remains the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen of any episode on .

Unfortunately, Dustin paints himself as a loser by throwing out a bunch of stories about his sex exploits, sex conquests (shouldn't he be busted for being a sex offender already?), penis size, alcohol drinking, pot smoking, and sexual offenses at Disneyland. The more he tells these stories, the more boring the book is. By the way, Brandon Tartikoff, who passed away during the mid 90's, was a genius and a legend who was responsible for some of the most incredible television shows in the history, and it's nice to see Dustin to pay respects to him.

All in all, is worth the read, and a quick one at that."
Behind the Bell,Lee,"January 14, 2018",1.0,"As a massive fan of Saved By The Bell, I was quite eager to read this book. I thought it was actually quite intriguing some of the stories as to what happened behind the scenes at one of the most popular kids tv programmes ever made.

However, my 1 star rating stems from the fact that after I read the book and went to read about it in more details on the web, I found out that it was all a crock of crap, and that it's likely that the majority of stuff didn't actually happen. It seems like the book was ghost written by someone from interviews he did with Diamond so a lot of the information seemed to be ""exaggerated"" a lot. Plus Diamond kept going on about his conquests over the years, yet I read that apparently a sex tape that he was in wasn't actually him, so he probably lied about that as well.

A lot of the stuff in the book was about how he supposedly got a lot of crap from the other cast members, but now I can see why, especially his history in later life such as being arrested for wounding etc.

If I was you, I would avoid this book. If I want to read a story about a TV programme by someone called Diamond, I would rather it be Dominik Diamond talking about GamesMaster. This book will now be deleted from my kindle, never to grace it again."
Behind the Bell,Kristy♡,"February 7, 2021",,"I checked this out on Libby after hearing about the recent passing of Dustin Diamond. I'm not going to rate this one, since it's an autobiography & I'm not even sure what I would rate it anyway. I checked this one out mainly out of curiosity. Saved By The Bell is one of my favorite shows, and hearing more about it seemed a little intriguing to me.

Of course, this book got a bit 'gossipy'. I wouldn't say anything really surprised me because they were teens during that time so some stuff I kind of expected.

I did question some things, whether they were actually true or not. But, it's not really my place to say. Reading about his personal experiences and his love life was almost to much information, and certain times I felt myself eye rolling.

There's some fun facts about Saved By The Bell that pops up throughout the book, and that was the main thing I found interesting."

There were interesting factoids like about tunnels under the set and that Mark Paul Gosslar is half Thai. I got through it really quickly.

Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you failed. Badly. To say Revealing Eden is offensive is such a massive understatement. I couldn't even stomach more that a few pages at a time. It was like taking a spork to your eye, but then it breaks leaving you with only the handle to carry out your dark deed. Even with the obvious racism aside, the Revealing Eden is simply not good. From the dialogue to the characters to the plot, it was very badly written. A tragic mess.

There are a few things you should know before reading this review:

I am an African-American.
I went into this book knowing I would probably dislike it. Why?
-Because I'm obviously masochistic.
-Because I'm taking one for the team. You're welcome.
-Because Foyt that not many African-Americans had read her book. Here I am and yes, we still exist.
I will most likely address a few statements made by Foyt about her novel as it pertains to
Oh, and this review is kinda long. Sorry about that. LOADS to cover. >.<

Apparently, according to Victoria Foyt the population of white people have plummeted due to an increase in sun radiation, leaving black people in charge. My first issue was with the lack of science in that premise. (And no. Throwing out random scientific names of insects, animals and plants does not signify that you've done your homework.) If the sun's radiation was *that* bad, being black won't do you that much good. What's even more odd is that for majority of the novel, Eden is hanging out outside her coating (more on that later).I kept waiting for her to complain about how hot it was or that her skin felt burnt, but it never happened. Her father is working in a lab attempting to genetically alter people so that they have animal traits and no one has created a better sunblock or, I don't know, CURED CANCER?! Where is the logic in that?

Whites in this novel are considered a burden to society since they have such a low rate of survival. If one does not have a mate by age 18, they are to be sentenced to death. There seems to be an obvious solution to this hypothetical problem: breed out the weaker genetics. But instead white people are oppressed just for the sake of oppression. And even though Eden knows she has had two mating offers, she refuses to accept either one, choosing to wait for her ""Dark Prince"" in hopes that he will pick up her mating option. Her reasoning?

*sigh* I can't believe I have to break this down, but if a black person and a white person have a baby, that doesn't automatically guarantee a dark-skinned baby. In fact, some may have very fair complexion. Funny thing the way genetics works. But what did I expect? Almost all the dark-skinned people in were black as night. The one person who mentioned with brown skin is assumed to be mixed. *Shaking my head* It was then I should have realized that logic was not going to be  strong point.

In order for Eden to fit in, she walks around with a coating of ""Midnight Luster"" on her skin and hair. She talks about dying her hair black and I couldn't figure out why she was doing that. Doesn't Foyt know that black peoples' hair is not actually black? Is that a common misconception even today? It's weird because it's something I've never thought of before. Sure, there are some whose hair is black, but it's not very common at all. It was the little things like that were I noticed a trend beginning: Foyt did absolutely no research on African-Americans or any other race for that matter. It is very evident by her constant reliance on black stereotypes applied even to white characters.



Applying black stereotypes to a white female to generate sympathy for the main character:

A black woman's figure categorizing her status in society:

*facepalm*:

Oh and I can't forget about the constant theme running rampant that black people are out to get the white people. As if black people, that are now in charge, have nothing else better to do with their time than antagonize others. White women everywhere are doing the >_>

Every black person in the world is out to get white people:


It's always black people:

Songs about black men raping a white girl:







Even more rape comparisons:

Go on and scream. Let it out.



And on and on it goes. But then it gets worse when because there doesn't seem to be any indication that slavery or the Civil Rights Movement ever happened. How was she being oppressed? Well as far as I can tell, white people were well-fed, had their own places, had jobs etc. The biggest thing against them was the mating age, having to wear their ""coating"" (I'm not sure if that was a law or anything) and getting rude remarks from black people. On a few occasions Eden even wishes the world could go back to a time where white people were free to go outside with their white skin without being persecuted. She frequently says that a black person couldn't possibly understand what it was like to be in her shoes. *slow blink*







Yeah, that's not offensive at all. Not one bit. #sarcasm

And then there is the issue of the FFP A.K.A. the Federation of Free People, ""a militant organization of Coals that vowed to rid the planet of Pearls."" Pause. *deep breaths* How am I supposed to take that? The Federation of ? Get me off this planet. I'm just going to leave that alone before I start seeing blood-red. Too late, I just saw red. Excuse me.



Okay, sorry about that. That was a tad awkward.

I also want to address the titles given to the races.

White- Pearls

Asian- Ambers

Latino- Tiger Eyes

Black- Coals

Albino- Cottons

Are you kidding me? Coals? As in black as coals? Pearls? As in precious pieces of jewelry? Cotton? As in what my ancestors were forced to pick in the fields? Do I even need to explain how offensive that is? And Foyt's response to the backlash of these titles?



No, no, no, no. NO! You do not give a title that has been used as a racial slur to a people who have been oppressed. You do not do that. And if you think any of that is okay, something is deeply wrong with you. By no stretch of the imagination can ""Pearl"" be considered a racial slur. Unless, along with common sense, this society has happened to lose every dictionary in existance. In which case, I shall provide the definition.



1. a smooth, rounded bead formed within the shells of certain mollusks and composed of the mineral aragonite or calcite in a matrix, deposited in concentric layers as a protective coating around an irritating foreign : valued as a gem when lustrous and finely colored. Compare .
2. something resembling this, as various synthetic substances for use in costume jewelry.
3. something similar in form, luster, etc., as a dewdrop or a capsule of medicine.
4. something  or choice; the finest example of anything: pearls of wisdom.
5. a very pale gray approaching white but commonly with a bluish tinge.

Yup, that is just the title I would give to a group that is being oppressed. Tell them they're  while giving them a name that Moreover, if ""Coal"" supposed to be a positive title, highlighting their strengths, then why is ""Cotton"" considered derogatory? By definition cotton is a very useful resource. It's strong, durable, able to withstand cold and hot temperatures. So what's the deal here?


I don't think for a second Fyot didn't know what she was doing when she wrote that because in the beginning of the novel she calls ""Coal"" a racial slur herself.

First of all, I'm surprised she was still alive after saying that to someone of the elite class. Surely if Pearls are so worthless and oppressed, there would be severe consequences for an action like that? Second, Foyt is again baking her cake and trying to stuff her face with it too. Which one is it? It's either a positive term or a racial slur. It cannot be both. I'll tell you what I think. I think Foyt was just trying to smooth things over with her choice of words. And failed, I might add, because my bullshit meter is about to explode.

In the second half of the novel I had no idea what was going on half the time. The scenes were very jumbled with no clear direction of where the plot was headed. World building left way too many holes in the story. Because surely there are more races on Earth that just the ones listed in Character interactions were much of the same confusion. But I think that it mostly had to do with the fact that Eden was a fucking idiot. Her stupidity burned. For real.



From this day forward I can never say Bella Swan was the worst. Eden is the worst protagonist I have ever read. Not only does she completely miss the point over and over again, regardless of how many times it is spelled out, but she is extremely selfish and all around unlikable. There is a scene in the novel where Eden happens across an anaconda and I felt myself rooting for the snake. Sadly, he didn't win. *weeps*

One thing that was clear was how Eden suddenly became attracted to Bramford after he became half beast. One minute she is talking about how sexy he is and the next she is calling him names, even after he saves her life several times. (Bold is mine.)







Also she likes to ride him like an animal:

What. The. Hell. A black man is turned into an animal and you have your white protagonist daydreaming about riding him like a frickin' pony? I just... can't.

When I finally finished reading I had to ask myself what kind of person would think any of this would be remotely okay? Foyt says:

I take issue with the white community only able to be provoked by featuring a white girl who is oppressed by black people using the very same stereotypes we fight against everyday. So, yes. I taking extreme offense to that. If Foyt is indeed ""color blind"" as she claims then making readers connect with a black character shouldn't be a problem for her. But instead she chose to ""turn racism on its head"" and say, ""Black folk, I know you guys have dealt with some really rough shit in the past, but what if it happened to white people?"" No, just no. The African-American community exists *because* of the oppression. It is history, roots. It is the one thing that must be left alone. You can't just take that away from us and apply it yourselves and make us look like the bad guys in your novel! This is one of the few times where I had to sit back and wonder who could possibly enjoy this book.

Oh, really? Racist point of view?  Racism isn't dead. It's something that many of us has to face everyday. As a people, it is ingrained in our society that our features are less desirable than that of whites. There are somethings some people will never understand. They have never had to walk in the shoes of another race and therefore they have limited understanding on what it means to be a Person of Color. When you get followed around in a clothing store because of your skin color, when you can't go into the 7-11 with your hoodie on, when a job tells you your natural hair is ""unprofessional,"" when your 4-year-old daughter asks you why her hair doesn't ""go down like a princess"" as if hers could never be considered as such, when you see celebrities of your race white washed in ad campaigns, when your male relatives are arrested for suspicious, when you see your grandparents cry after Obama was elected because they thought they would never live to see the day where a black man held office, when you know there are some parts of the country where you are just not welcome because of your skin color, or when you walk down the aisle of your local book store and all you see on the book covers are white people, with a small section devoted to African-Americans, you realize you are living in a white world. Racist point of view? Wherever would one have gotten that?

I think this goes without saying:



You didn't think I'd just leave it on that unhappy note did you? Pfft, as if!

Ay yo, if black people truly ruled da world we damn sure wouldn't be toting 'round some whack name like ""Coals."" Naw, we'd go for something MUCH more gangsta like, . Then we'd go n' elect Snoop Dogg as our president and Dave Chappelle as our VP, ya feel meh?  We'd legalize MJ and the national anthem would be "".""  We'd move the capital to the ATL, where we like to ""."" would be covered by dental insurance. Oppress white people? Naw, we ain't got time fo' dat shit, man! We'd be too busy from da Gov'ment, giving back to the economy.

Chicken spots n' drive through liquor stores would be on every corner. You welcome!  (So what, we get drunk...). 12pm would be a mandatory nation wide nap time, which no one would pay any attention to. Fuck the system! (So what, we don't sleep...). Though dey should 'cause """" is a very serious condition affecting 1 out of 2 black folk e'rywhere. And finally, random flash mob dances would be to songs like """" and """" (We just havin' fun and we don't care who sees...).

""Conceivably, if the book had not reached the African-American community of readers, if such a category still exists, perhaps there might be some backlash.""
-Victoria Foyt

She did not just go there.




- (no not really) (but still)

When I get depressed, I don't want to be around other people. I usually sit in an empty room. Sometimes I'll use art therapy and draw something glittery and happy to make me feel better. Other people? They like hugs. Me, I hate even being people when I'm feeling down.

So now you understand why I spent a lot of time alone after reading the first ten pages of Save the Pearls.

Art therapy? This is what I drew while fuming and angsting over Save the Pearls:



I was not a happy camper. There are a multitude of reasons why.

I mean, even if I were to overlook the blatantly racist premise and plotline, Revealing Eden still sucks.

The author can't write her way out of a fucking box. First of all, Eden is hardly a . I've seen potted plants with more personality. I would have rather the book be written from the perspective of a potted plant, in all honesty.

Revealing Cedar... Save the Trees #1. Would have been more interesting and thought provoking than this.

But I'm getting away from point. Secondly, if Eden had a personality you would be sure Foyt would tell you exactly what it is. Because she makes sure to tell every fucking other thing. Does this woman even know the meaning of the word ""show""?!

She couldn't have been less subtle if she taped her book to a club and proceeded to whack me over the head.

The world in which she tries to place us in is so obviously fake. It doesn't feel sci-fi or post apocalyptic. While with good post-apocalyptic books (Angelfall, for instance) I was able to get into the setting almost immediately, every mention of the society Eden was living in had me groaning in agony and clawing at my eyes and face.



""Pearls, which was the derogatory term for whites...""

OH YEAH I'M SURE

IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE ONE

I mentioned in an update how slurs have reasons as to they are slurs.

The most infamous n word, as I mentioned, could be translated to mean ""black object"". So, yeah, you can take a wild guess as to why it's offensive. (For the purpose of now we're going to disregard the hundreds of years of baggage piled on top of that, which is another reason why pearls is shit and doesn't work.)

A pearl is a precious gem! And, okay, even disregarding the fact that it is I could say ""well maybe they're calling them useless clam spit"". But even then, to call another group you're trying to oppress a pearl and turn around and call yourself a ? What the motherfuckery...

I guess the Coals are just that shitty at oppressing people.



The more of the book I read, the more I felt like asking Foyt what the frex
she was thinking when she wrote this. And I only got to page ten, mind you.

And even then, at the time I was speechless. Other than the underlying instinctive reaction to deliver a good kick to the crotch of whoever was responsible for this, I think looked pretty much like,



Because, how, how can you write this.

And not know.

How offensive it is.

Maybe if Foyt was a teenager, a twelve year old at that, I would have understood. Like how five year olds do the supposedly native american mouth call thing without knowing it's racist because nobody ever told them? Maybe? But Foyt is a grown woman. She should know better. And that only made it

Of course, then there's the obvious. That she does know. And she just doesn't care. Which is what I'm going to assume.

So, in conclusion, Foyt:



DISHONOR ON YOU.

DISHONOR.

Because, you know what? You are dishonorable. You are dishonorable for writing this book. You are dishonorable for thinking you're doing anyone a favor by publishing this. . You have no honor. None. You say you're 'turning the tables on racism'. Oh please. The only thing you're doing is to racism. Yes. It's true. Believe it or not the premise of ""white people being oppressed by evil and savage black people"" isn't a new thing. You are not original. You are not helping by perpetrating this. You are not helping.



If you really want to help, you know what you can do?



Yes, that is about the only thing can do to help. Sit in the fucking shame cube and show your remorse for this disgusting ""book"". Go on, now.

Everyone who isn't Foyt... I would recommend staying away from this so called novel. Sure, I know that you may be curious, but believe me, it won't cause you anything but pain. And if you're lucky, it will make you hate humans and feel like shit after you read it.

Like me.



Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to consume so much chocolate my very will become a mix of cacao, sugar and milk. Have a nice day."
Revealing Eden,Amanda,"July 27, 2012",1.0,"This is a racist piece of shit excuse for a book. I'm sorry, but I can't take a book that ""turns the tables on racism"" by--once again--victimizing poor, young, fragile caucasian girls and vilifying POC seriously. There is no excuse for blatant racism. The cover of this book uses blackface. One of the core concepts of this book is using blackface.

Pretty blond-haired blue-eyed white girls using blackface is NOT turning the tables on racism. Stop pretending like it is, and stop adding fuel to the fire.

The terms for POC are offensive and ill-issued. Black individuals are referred to as Coals (the image draws to mind dirty, undesirable, disposable); Asian individuals are referred to as Ambers; Latino and Hispanic individuals are referred to as Tiger's-Eyes; meanwhile, caucasians are referred to as Pearls (precious, rare, etc.). THIS IS RACISM. It's not even masked racism; it's in your face, on the page. On page nine, it shines through clear as day--our protagonist refers to a POC as ""them."" (Italicized, by the way.)

Take me back to the time when teenagers read books of solid merit and upstanding moral meaning; perhaps this is the time when dystopian actually meant something in the literary world, where Bradbury and Orwell and Huxley and Atwood and Heinlein and their contemporaries reigned. I'm getting quite tired with the authors who have the strongest influence over today's youth exacerbating a problem rather than attempting to navigate the terrain constructively and without a whiny, self-pitying protagonist floundering in the way.

I am ashamed that this book is being taken seriously. I am ashamed that it's winning awards. I am ashamed that people not that much younger than me are the target market and are being exposed to this bullshit. I'm ashamed that a grown-ass woman would think that it's okay for her to write about something that she's never had any kind of experience with. I shouldn't feel the need to apologize for every white writer out there, and it shouldn't be my job. Get this shit off the market and don't let your kids read it."
Revealing Eden,Tenth,"July 28, 2012",1.0,"I only read the first chapter of this book, and I barely even made it that far, because this book is so painfully racist.

Supposedly by making white people an oppressed group and black people the dominant group this book 'turns the tables on racism' with the intent of showing readers that racism is bad. But in practise it seems to just be an excuse to frame black people and dangerous and threatening and white people as poor little victims, reenforcing racist stereotypes. Even the title of the series ""Save the Pearls"" (which translates from this book's jargon to ""Save the Whites"") sounds like the type of thing you come across on racist extremist websites that fearmonger about white people 'dying out' because other races are apparently such a threat. Not to mention that in the society Foyt dreams up white people apparently spend all their time in blackface, a device she uses without seeming to display any sort of knowledge of, or concern about, how it has been historically (and contemporarily, sadly) used as a tool to mock and spread stereotypes about black people.

If you want to read YA fiction which genuinely uses the tool of switching around who is the oppressor and oppressed in order to give the reader a different perspective on racism, try Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman. A much less offensive, much more nuanced, and all around better written YA book that explores issues of race."
Revealing Eden,Isa Lavinia,"July 27, 2012",1.0,"Originally posted at Paperback Wonderland.

This book was one of the most racist things I have ever read.
The bare bones of the plot: a world where black people are the oppressing majority and white people are the oppressed minority. Obviously, the concept isn't new. It was done - and well done, at that - by Malorie Blackman in her Noughts and Crosses series. If you're interested in the premise, but you dislike blatant racist propaganda, give that one a try.

You could assume this reversal would serve to de-construct issues surrounding racism (as happened in Blackman's books). You'd be wrong. The way this goes about reads more like, ""how can we make everyone care about the racism POC have to endure? I know! Let's get a pretty, blond, white girl to go through that!"" It's a mockery, a dystopian what-if, with all its horrors, of what is a reality to POC to this very day.

Foyt doesn't just reverse social roles, as Blackman did, she comes up with a dystopian, post-apocalyptic future in which solar radiation (""The Great Meltdown"") killed almost everyone - except most black people.
Even though UV radiation's effects on the immune system and eyes are independent of race, and it's never clearly explained how humanity managed to survive in a world where flora and fauna have been decimated - the ever present holograms, as far as I know, won't fill your belly or keep you from getting rickets. But moving on.

This book is so messed up that I honestly need to give examples so people don't accuse me of making it up. So...

""""

The book starts off with black face and I'm not even going to touch that one, because it's too obvious to anyone with a functional brain. In this book, the author goes so far as to have """" known as """" performing in . I'm also not going to go off on how problematic the whole issue of passing is. Anyone with the bare minimum knowledge of history already knows it. The author addresses it only as problematic insofar as it is just another way the protagonist fails to see how beautiful she really is. I mean... I mean, really. I don't even know anymore.

""""

I'm sure that, if asked, Foyt would have a very witty justification for ""Coals"" - the way she chose to term the black majority in the book. Exposure to solar radiation will make you perish of ""The Heat"", and those who survive it are the ""Coals"" - hahaha, get it?
Too bad that when in context - in this case, comparing it to what other races are called - ""Coals"" is still insulting. Get this, the extinct albinos are ""Cottons"" (I swear I'm not making this up to better showcase how absurdly racist this is, Foyt really seems to have gone out of her way to be insulting), white people are ""Pearls"" - of course there are black pearls but let's ignore that and focus on the fact that pearls are precious gems and coals are... coals. So what happened is that, in a dystopia where black people are the ruling class, they chose a derogatory term for themselves? Am I getting this right? Because don't let yourself be fooled, the ruling majority is the one who decides who is who and what is what. So black people decided they would be Coals and white people would be Pearls? Was it a racist naming decision by the author or was it a racist implication that black people are so ignorant they don't even understand the value dissonance of their choice? It's really a choose your flavour of racism issue here.

Don't let this whole naming thing distract you, even though Pearls are the lowest of the low, the protagonist still finds time in her busy schedule of being oppressed to be racist:
""

""
Can you imagine how this would work out in the real world - I don't even need to add, ""back when..."", I mean .

""[Eden's father]""

Never mind that brilliant POC find their paths barred when they try to make it in Academia today, not even worth mentioning how POC scientists were treated in the real world social period corresponding to this novel. The fact that her father is a ""Pearl"" but still the lead scientist is, by itself, unbelievable, not only that but he managed to get his 17 year old daughter a position in a top scientific facility. But let us set aside the absurd to explore the ever popular ""white man saves the day"" aspect of it, shall we? I mean, really, even in a world where they are at the bottom of the social ladder, and all but extinct, the white protagonists still manage to save the ""ignorant"" POC. Well done. And it gets worse:

""""
Not only do white people save the day, but the POC don't just lack the ability to save themselves, they lack the very capacity to even understand how it happens at all.

""""

Why? Why provide this incentive for the reproduction of a race deemed inferior? Let's take a look at how that worked out in the real world. African slaves who their owners thought were no better than animals, were bred as such, to make strong slaves, thus serving a purpose to their exploiting oppressors. However, in this world, ""Pearls"" don't seem to fare too well. Their position would be even less regarded than Native populations back in the day, I mean, at least the Natives didn't just up and die if left on their own as Pearls do - and what happened to Natives under the colonizers? Genocide, that's what. They scattered them, took away their lands and resources, took the children away from their parents to effectively destroy their culture and, to this day they are extremely oppressed. There are no incentives given to rebuild their great nations, be it in the US, be it in Canada, be it in Australia, Native populations are always amongst the poorest.
But I guess the ""Pearls"" would have to ""get mated"" because how can you have a YA book without the heroine discovering that her reason to go on is finding and keeping a man? Unthinkable.

Bramford, her boss and potential romantic interest has skin """" so I don't know if Foyt was being poetic and saying he was dark, or being insulting and saying he was ashy to the nth degree, like, ""That dude really needs some lotion, his skin... storms a brewing. You see that man and he only makes sense in a production of The Tempest, hovering overhead"".

Jamal (of course, he'd be named Jamal, of course) """" (Eden's words, not mine), her other love interest """" - I don't know how, in this day and age, an author - therefore a person who knows how to read - has not yet grasped the concept that being ""colorblind"" regarding race is, in fact, racist. You have to be in a position of privilege to have the option to ignore race, if you check your privilege you will not say ignorant things like, ""I don't see race."" Really, it's not a complicated concept.

Eden, as a character, is horrible. Whiny, racist, full of self hatred and always expecting her problems will be solved by her ""Dark Prince"" who always calls her ""Little Bunny"" and ""pet"" and despite this she can't wait to be mated to him and have his babies. I thought it unlikely he'd be interested in her, considering her personality alone all issues of race aside


And if all this mess wasn't bad enough there was some bestiality sprinkled on top of the whole thing.

By the way, I think Foyt forgot something in her list of ""thank yous"":"
Revealing Eden,Rose,"August 6, 2012",1.0,"Initial reaction:Before I start this review, I want to clarify a few things. First, I've read the whole of this novel. I'm not judging it on the cover (though I think in the measure of this review, I'd like to talk about that separately), and I'm not judging it on just the premise alone - I read the entire book. Technically I read this book twice if I count the hour long read that I zipped through to see what would happen with it (this was in a copy loaned to me at first, but then when NetGalley approved me, I returned the copy and went by the NG's e-copy to make my notes and highlights), and then another time for clarity of details. I've taken notes, I've highlighted my e-copy to include excerpts and statements in the following review. So I've been through the whole of this with a patient eye. Probably too patient, and probably moreso than many of my peers would probably be if they knew what was in this book.

Second, I'm a woman of color, and an avid reader. I'm not one to skirt talking about racial issues and the harsh realities that people of color face each day. I think being able to recognize multiculturalism in our society is an important thing, and talking about racial/cultural differences and hardships and being able to come to terms with them comprise much more than talking about the differences in our skin tones.

So, Victoria Foyt writes a YA novel that promises to ""turn the tables"" on racism. To make a young adult audience understand that there's more to a person than just their race. She aims to create a novel that approaches racial attitudes with sensitivity and fresh insight.

Well, I'm here to say for the record that Ms. Foyt failed miserably on all those counts.

Is there a coming of terms for Eden finding acceptance for who she is? Ultimately yes, but goodness it was a rocky road of ill description to get there, and it manages to insult multiple minority groups in the process (Thank you for thoroughly insulting African-Americans, Latinos, Asians, the Huaorani people, Aztec culture, among other groups). I would not recommend this for a YA audience, to be honest, and I'm going to outline just how badly it comes across. The characters are flat, the worldbuilding is lazy, the research and science is haphazardly drawn, the handling of racial issues I can't even begin to say how mediocre they came across, and the premise/execution is not only incendiary, but also misogynistic and culturally inaccurate, with many elements thrown together without much rhyme or reason. Much of the narrative is naive, completely skewed, and I was not only offended, but horrified at the level of ignorance.

This by no means a reflection of reality or even a plausible future. It's drivel.

In due perspective, if this book is any reflection upon the author's ideas on racial relations, cultural expansion and love in today's culture, I think Ms. Foyt has a long path of learning to do.



I'm going to be personal for a quick before diving headfirst into this review. This is the hardest review I've ever had to write, and as such it's difficult to know where to begin with Foyt's work. I don't get into the habit of telling people what or how to write, but it comes with the territory that if you write on a subject of any tonality - especially if you're dealing with tough issues like racism, prejudice, and establishing cultural histories in a constructive manner - you have to be knowledgeable and sensitive to your subject(s).

I believe that Victoria Foyt lacks understanding of any of the cultural histories that she expounds upon in this book. Her point on using the book as a way to illustrate how racism hurts and how to come terms with loving one's own identity is mostly lost with how disconnected it is with its subject matter. It's as if she looked on Wikipedia and said ""Ooh, here's an indigenous tribe (Huaorani), and I'll pick from these groups (i.e. Aztec), and I think I'll put this cultural historical backdrop with this other one, mix it up and see what happens. Ta-da! I'm 'cultural'!""

That's clearly no way to go about it. It's never a good idea to approach dealing with racial/cultural acceptance by perpetuating fears, clichés and practicing tunnel vision when it comes to the crude perception, description and depiction of ANY group. Foyt, unfortunately, violates all of those respective dimensions. I struggle between thinking whether she was aware of this, or if she really approached it without knowing just how incendiary it would come across. It's difficult to say she was completely unaware of them because the elements are so infuriating and blatant.

If you take the book by it's barest bones, taking out the racist/misogynistic/non-sensical language - it progresses as a very formulaic YA dystopian romance. Girl resides in post-apocalyptic society ravaged by a natural disaster that decimates the population. Girl is among the minority living under the rule of an oppressive majority, even among some who seek to eliminate her kind. Girl seeks to escape with her father - who's working towards a way to live in the society against the dictations of the oppressive majority rule and societal limitations. Girl meets member of the majority that she absolutely hates and doesn't understand, but then she comes to *love* him by some turns of events. And Girl must join forces with that Majority member to overcome obstacles to their plight and their *love*. By the end, Girl comes to accept her role in the world, comes to find happiness with those she's aligned with, and moves forward to the next plight of her journey. The end.

Sounds harmless if you think about it that way, right? I almost wish it had become another story entirely, because those bare bones aren't a bad format, but the details of the story are ultimately what will matter in terms of how the story comes across.

Let's consider the other elements, starting with the cover and how it ties in with the story. Horrid Photoshop attempt aside (and I would not have picked up this on the cover alone - it's just not flattering), there's a lot about this cover that does tie in with the story. I can't hide the fact I'm offended by it, both with the premise and collective story behind me. I said this once in another review I wrote (via ""League of Strays"" by Schulman), but I think it bears repeating here: ""...the one thing that should be clear is that a person of any age should never feel afraid enough to hide who they are - no matter what the dimension entails - gender, age, race, orientation, religion - what have you.""

In this case, the storyline deals with race and how a girl has to hide herself to be a part of another race in order to blend and abide by the terms of her society. I'll leave you to think on that while I move to the other elements of the cover. The eyes above the half-white, half-""disguised"" girl are those belonging to a jaguar, which is the partial identity of one of the ""majority"" members that the main character comes into company with during the story. And finally - the leaves represent the jungle/forest that the story eventually transitions to.

I'm going to take extra care in saying this next bit. Let me explain this because the author may not have intended to do it and may defend it in every argument she makes to kingdom come, but the implications are that on the cover and IN the collective story - it uses Blackface and mocks the experiences of people of color. is a mockery of the experiences of people of color - of multiple groups of people of color.

You might be thinking, ""Rose, why would you say these things when it's obvious that the author says she's speaking against racism in this book?"" Well, let's get into the specifics of the story, out from the bare bones.

17- year old Eden Newman is the protagonist of this book - the girl showcased on the cover. There's no subtlety in her naming - it draws upon Creationist allusions in Christianity, which means somewhere down the road, the creation of a new race is probably going to have something to do with Eden. This is further asserted with Eden's appointed role in this dystopian society - she has to find someone to mate with before her 18th birthday or else be cut off from the limited resources in the environment desolated by solar overheating. The problem, in Eden's view and with her role in the respective society, is that she's a ""Pearl"", the pejorative for Caucasians in this story. There are other specific pejoratives in the story as well - ""Coal"" for Black, ""Amber"" for Asians, ""Tiger Eye"" for Latinos. ""Cotton"" even for Albinos. *rolls eyes*

I have a problem with the use of slurs in this book, not just for the naming but for their respective, and I would say inaccurate, function in this work. For one, slurs are intended to dehumanize and degrade the person or group they're oriented toward. They are supposed to harm/hurt. ""Cotton"" and ""Coal"" - in the real world, have been used as pejoratives before, with various combinations. If the author had bothered to do her research (even taking as much as 2 minutes to search on Google) on the etymology of slurs and where some of them are derived, maybe - just maybe, she would know how they function. Precious stones are NOT slurs. And I don't buy the explanation Foyt gave in the aftermath of criticisms of this.

""Why are whites called Pearls, while blacks are called Coals? Imagine a gritty, post-apocalyptic world where all that matters is survival. What good will a pearl do you when luxury items have no use? Coal has energy, fire, and real value. It is durable and strong, not easily crushed like a pearl. Pearl is a pejorative term here. Coals are admired. Coals oppress Pearls because they fear that those with light skin will add to a population unable to survive ""The Heat,"" and drain meager resources. ""

Three counterarguments to this: first, this isn't just a black/white issue - Why were the other races given their respective naming in measure of precious stones? That was never explained in the book - not for function nor offending context (much like neither Coal or Pearl were explained - if your book doesn't explain these things, it's a bad sign.). Second, isn't it contradictory for a slur against a respective group to have such a championing meaning? If the term ""Coal"" is a pejorative AGAINST the race it's intended for, and Eden uses it AGAINST the group she hates, why is it that the meaning is actually COMPLIMENTING their role in the society? Sense this does not make. (Even still, the argument Foyt makes with coals vs. pearls is inaccurate with respect to their physical properties.)

Third: if these identifications are meant to be slurs - why are they championed as identification for these groups than what they're actual names are concerned? Does everyone in this society identify by the slurs used against them, or is Eden just that racist? If it's an actual ""slur"" as it's intended, then maybe she would realize how wrong it was once she ended up with the man she supposedly loved, because she would know its use would be offensive, just as much as Pearl was when used against her.

Even with these considerations, I was far more offended by the frequent uses of ""bitch"" towards women in this book and the italicized use of ""them"" in this book than some of the so-called slurs that are used. Eden's the target of one of those uses of ""bitch"", but the others are used by Eden to describe her ""Coal"" female superiors among others. For example:

""That bitch Ashina was fifteen minutes late, and Eden wanted her break."" (Chapter 1, not really characteristic of someone who's in fear for her life and has dwindling self worth in the presence of the majority rule, is it?)

""Was the bitch trying to set her up?"" (Chapter 7, Eden referring to Ashina yet again…)

""Jamal and that bitch were in cahoots?"" (Chapter 7, Eden reflecting on Jamal's - a ""Coal"" she admired and trusted at one point in the story - betrayal and referring to Ashina, AGAIN.)

""Damn Bramford for picking the lock on her heart. Damn the hunger the kiss had awoken in her. And damn that conniving selfish bitch, Rebecca."" (Chapter 31 - Eden falling in love with her ""Coal"" counterpart, Bramford - who's actually helping Eden out of the oppressive society alongside Eden's father. Rebecca is Bramford's former DECEASED lover, who Eden is jealous of, though it should be noted that Rebecca betrayed Bramford. Eden actually acts for a time in the guise of Rebecca as to fool Bramford and ""make him suffer"". I'm not even going there. I just can't.)

Then there are the uses of the italicized , which are patronizing enough towards ""Coals"". They're supposed to be the oppressive majority in this book, but I couldn't help but think how insufferable Eden was with her use of these terms. It was hard to feel sympathy because Eden sounds like a spoiled brat instead of someone who's suffering under oppressive rule. Examples:

""And yet if Eden were one of , she would be safe."" (Chapter 1, Eden claims she wants to be a part of the majority because she thinks they're more ""beautiful"" and ""safe"", but this comes across as patronizing.)

""Eden flinched. One of was touching her."" (Chapter 1. Sure, Ms. Foyt. You're writing about racial relations and understanding prejudice, and yet you have one of touching the character and and inciting fear and disgust at the gesture from Eden's viewpoint. Seriously, this isn't right.)

""She suspected that every Coal passerby wanted to hurt her, though the statistical odds against that were high. And her sensors, which automatically translated the babel of foreign languages into English, the official language, told her it wasn't true. Still she could never shake the fear of being around so many of "" (Chapter 3)

The last one I'm quoting as stand alone because it was the one that shook me the most, though there are a total of about 9 instances in the text where used, probably in the first five or six chapters. It presumes the assimilation of languages in this supposed distant future, plus establishes a fear factor against another race than hers in this supposed future. How is this not an example of Eden being prejudiced herself? How the heck is this turning the tables on racism?

It should be noted that Foyt had many chances to show why the different divisions between these groups were, and to delve into the complexity of the hatred and dissention among them. She didn't do that.

I'm getting a little ahead of myself because I haven't expounded on the direction which the story takes from it's initial grounds, but rather trying to outline its constructional problems. So now I'm going to take a bit to talk about the characters and progressive plot.

We've met Eden and know her aim in the society is to mate and survive in her respective society according to the ""rules"" established, but there are other people around her who are also in her inner circles. There's her father, who just so happens to be a genius ""Pearl"" scientist who's trying to find ways of surviving the ""Heat"" so they can emerge from their underground society and live among the realm without being under the rule of the ""Coal"" majority. There's also Bramford, a high ranking member of the majority class of ""Coals"", who secretly helps Eden and her father both by subjecting himself to experiments that mess with this DNA and are supposed to be adaptations that will help them live on the surface.

The scientific explanations in this book are bogus, if even in just the premise alone. I don't know if Foyt knew about the existence of ""melanin theory"" and how it's been knocked down many times as unscientific and culturally incendiary (especially in how it contributes to racism within and outside of their respective populations), but this book plays into that non-theory very heavily. While it is true that melanin does act to counter effects of UV rays from the sun, it's not an absolute shield. The effects of global warming as being a ""cautionary warning"" in this book are noted, but it's not a heavy theme. It's just a plot device. Not to mention the book completely skirts the issue of how adaptation comes into play when residing in a specific environment, and how melanocytes adjust melanin production depending on the climate one lives, and that CAN shift with generational adaptations. Still, high melanin count doesn't mean an absolute protector for people of color. If the elements are enough to where a large population dies from the affects, and it kills life on the surface, then it's going to be a factor in killing people regardless of their skin tone.

I'm not sure what Foyt was thinking with a lot of the leaps taken in this work. It doesn't feel realistic even considering the sci-fi/fantasy tag. Trying to also legitimize the science in this by throwing in scientific names for species didn't help matters much either, I saw right through it and found the alternating names distracting and far too heavily loaded into the work.

In any case, Bramford, Eden, and Eden's father are working under secrecy, even as there are external forces at work in the society that threaten them. Eden's actions get them into trouble when she spills secret information to someone she thought was an ally (Jamal, a ""Coal"" she thought was a potential mate). Adding to the complication are a group called the FFA, who champion eliminating all ""Pearls"" from existence *rolls eyes*. There's really not much about the FFA to really note their respective role in the story.

Eventually, the plot shifts to where they have to escape the lab, and Bramford, as a result of the experiments becomes a half man/half jaguar adapting to the environment. I guess Foyt was right on one note about this being a ""Beauty and the Beast"" love story, but it's so farfetched and plays right into so many racial stereotypes. It's not even subtle. I never knew the point where Eden really shifted into loving Bramford. It was more like a light switch that suddenly came on in the progression of the story. Eventually Eden finds herself in the company of the rainforest and the Huaorani (which…I don't understand how a rainforest would be able to survive some of the disaster elements this book gave from the beginning? Another point of contradiction.)

Misrepresenting the Huaorani culture and Aztec histories, as well as trying to blend Christian elements within it or whatever else the author was trying to do with it threw my patience out the window. I read on to the end, but didn't have any investment in the characters to care. even when it eventually reaches it's noted resolution and ""lesson"".

I'm going to stop here, because there are far too many problems in this work to be able to write about in the mishandling of racial issues and cultural expansion. It's incredibly patronizing to people of color on multiple standpoints, for someone supposedly writing to be against racist principles and establish cultural understanding, it doesn't help Foyt's case. This needed a far more able, sensitive, and knowledgeable voice to carry the respective story.

I would not recommend this book for anyone, let alone a YA audience.

Revealing Eden,Gabriela,"July 27, 2012",1.0,"racist. racist. racist. This person puts everything into perspective much more eloquently so I leave her open letter to the author here:

Dear Victoria Foyt,
I had never thought I’d have to write a letter like this. I’d thought that perhaps people knew some things were off limits, and that such things were off limits because they still cause hurt to very real and very subjugated people, but I was wrong.

Mrs. Foyt, I’d like you to know that I’m only nineteen, a young Black person budding in a world where I am (whether consciously or otherwise) considered less than because of my race. Even as a light-skinned Black person, I face fetishistic catcalls from white males, propositions for sexual conduct and marriage and discrimination in the job market.

I’m sure you’re not interested in reading about my life, and that’s perfectly fine. I’m sending you this email, not to inquire, but to share my feelings on your (latest?) book “Save the Pearls”.

You see Mrs. Foyt, I was under the impression that you were indeed “turning the tables on racism”. The phrase itself acknowledges that in today’s current world situation, white people cannot and do not face racism on institutional and global levels like counterparts of color. My interest was piqued to see just how your book would manage to flip the script.

I would like to say that I was surprised at how dreadful the concept of your book is, but I wasn’t. People of color are always let down in various forms of media and entertainment; we receive mere morsels compared to our white counterparts in terms of representation, acting roles, and complex character writing in novels.

Mrs. Foyt your book isn’t turning the tables on anything. In fact, you are helping to mold young minds such as mine to further ignore the plight of people of color and disrespect the historical pain they’ve been through. Your book, your youtube channel — it encourages blackface, a practice used to dehumanize black people. I’m sure you’re aware of the racist minstrel shows performed in the U.S. and if not, I implore you to use Google’s search engine to read about it as well as view film evidence that portrays black people in a less than favorable light (to say the least). The mentalities and stereotypes blackface created have not dissipated over the years Mrs. Foyt. People of color, black people specifically (I speak of them because I am black myself), still suffer from the detrimental acts committed by racist white people in the past. Hell, we still suffer due to detrimental acts committed by racist white people NOW.

My point concerning blackface is that, regardless of your intentions, blackface is hurtful and painful to black people. The historical pain and agony of being dehumanized, subjugated, murdered, lynched, raped (all in masse) cannot be separated from blackface for the sake of a novel written by a white woman. It CANNOT. I am writing this email to essentially express how I and many other black people feel; we are appalled by your racism, and yes, you are indeed being racist.

Your novel is no “neo-racist” treasure. It fails to address the issues people of color face today, something that could be done even if your novel focuses on “subjugated” white people. The terminology used in your novel reveals your racist subconscious (a subconscious white people as well as people of color possess): white people are referred to as ‘pearls’ I believe? And Asians are referred to as ‘ambers’? I also understand that Latin people are called ‘tiger-eyes’? These are all precious or semi-precious gems, of value on the market today. Do you see what I’m getting at? The black people in your novel are called coals, a term that actually has a historical background. Many dark skinned black people (I’m not particularly sure if you know any) have had themselves negatively likened to coal at some point in their lives, and if not, they’re among the lucky ones. It is evident that your novel doesn’t truly “turn the tables on racism” as you suggest, but rather, offers a common and wrong perspective on social dynamics through fantasy and post-apocalyptic science fiction.

The wide bracket you’ve place people of color under fails to take several things into account, things I hope (but doubt) you’ve addressed in your novel: what of pale-skinned black people? Are they pearls? East Asians, whose skin color is sometimes more fair than that of white people, and more prone to damage — are they considered pearls or do they remain ambers simply because of their race? Dark skinned southeast Asians, does their status improve to that of coals? There are pale skinned Latin@s, indigenous Latin@s, afro-Latin@s… have you taken them into account as well? It seems as though your book doesn’t acknowledge the racial complexities of our current world, nor does it take into account the future race-mixing that would occur before your apocalypse.

But in all honesty, your narrow-minded perspective on racial features pales (no pun intended) in comparison to the blackface which you encourage on your youtube channel. As I’ve stated before, blackface carries with it the weight and agony of widespread dehumanization and genocide; I often have an extremely difficult time explaining the severity of this to my counterparts in school as well as to adults who haven’t taken the time to learn about societal issues. I do not think you understand the gravity of encouraging impressionable people to commit blackface — regardless of its intention or purpose. You are fostering more ignorance through your young adult novel, and contributing to the silent killer that is covert white supremacy. Mrs. Foyt, you may think you’re showing appreciation for people of color, for dark skin (as I’ve noticed through your descriptions of dark skin) but there is a fetishistic tone that disturbs me, especially as someone (who is just one voice of millions) who is often harassed because of the hypersexualized nature associated with my race/skin color.

Your book has been published already and I doubt you’ll do any changes to anything you’ve already written because of a solitary letter sent by a lightskinned negro, but I hope you’ve taken the time to read this opinion, an opinion that actually matters much more than usually credited for; a person of color’s views on race and racism are always of the utmost importance, considering the discrimination and subjugation we face. This letter might have saddened you, might have angered you, but I hope that if you have indeed felt these emotions while reading this, you’ve considered the emotions of the people of color who were so deeply offended after having read the premise of your book and also after having read your book. I hope you considered the black people who were (once again) emotionally wounded, after viewing how you’ve encouraged blackface and used it as a mere plot device for a novel. I hope you considered my anger and my hurt, the emotions I have to stifle on a day to day basis in order to function in a world that will never care about me as much as it will care about you.

Thank you for your time.
I am not expecting a reply.

Revealing Eden,M,"July 28, 2012",1.0,"This is a terrible idea for a book. As a woman of color, I find it extremely offensive to see a woman in blackface on the promotion, a comparison to Beauty and the Beast, where a black man is considered 'beastly', and the names of the two races themselves - 'pearl' for white and 'coal' for black - what is this author trying to convey here? I'm sure anyone with a brain can guess. As a young adult, my intelligence is insulted - how could this be considered good literature when it blatantly trivializes the trials and tribulations of actual slavery? It can't - this book is absolute trash."

Revealing Eden,Mel (who is deeply in love with herself),"July 30, 2012",,"I saved my review yesterday without even finishing it. Here's the full thing.



Sometimes, people are convinced that they have the lower hand in life. They think the world's against them, that they are at the bottom of society's rungs. And sometimes, that is simply not the case. Victoria Hoyt has envisioned a world in which black people (or Coals) are at the top of society's social hierarchy because of their dark skin colour. White people (or ""Pearls"") are at the bottom of the hierarchy because of their pale skin colour.

I refuse to read a book which has such blatant racist undertones.




I mean, come on. Pearls and Coals?

Let's see what Pearls comes up with, shall we, when I Google it?



M'kay.

And now the Coals.



And here's a bonus picture, less than half the page down!



And we're expected to believe the need saving? It's the fricking that need saving, from such an ignorant author!

And don't even get me started on the protagonist's name. Eden? Eden? Go and Google Image ""Eden"" and see what comes up. Seriously, do it.



Yeah. For somebody who seems intent on spitting in the face of racism, Ms Hoyt sure seems to be doing the exact opposite. Even when Caucasians are in the , they are, essentially, the ""upper"" class.

And the synopsis? Apparently, Eden's father is the only one on the planet who can save humanity. Guess what? He's white, too. It seems the beast-like Coals can't do without the help of You know how, in Avatar, the native tribespeople (or N'avi) were doomed to die until Jake Sully came along? It's like that.

It seems Victoria Hoyt can't get over the fact that white people are now at the bottom of the ladder. Which is absurd, considering she's the one who's created this class system in the first place. Maybe she's too reluctant to let go of her privileged life as a Caucasian living in an American town, in which the only non-Caucasians she saw was her housekeeper and a few Cubans in her private high school. Maybe she can't let go of The Good Life a Caucasian usually has. She just can't resist giving them the upper hand. There's ""Eden"" with the Paradisiacal name. Her father, the man with the power to , and the general name given to Caucasians: Pearls.

Combatting racism, my ass.

EDIT



Read this. Just go and read it. Wow, Foyt, just when I couldn't think that you were more ignorant, I was proven completely wrong.

Oh, how terrible, they thought you were African American. BOO HOO. People think I'm white (And I'm an Italian-Hispanic) all the time.

DEAL WITH IT.

Also, maybe you should listen to the Sufferer's Last Sermon. Sure, it's fictional, but it has a good message for racist pricks like you.



Let's talk about racism and this book.
This book is about racism. This book is pretty much shaming black people and putting white people on a high pedestal.

So, they're called . What's the world called? ?

So, Asians are Ambers, Hispanics are Tiger's Eyes, and blacks are COALS? Wait, why the fuck not obsidian? Also, is the author an idiot? I'm part Spanish and I have green eyes that are pretty fucking large. And I'm light skinned.

CONGRATULATIONS ON STEREOTYPING AND CATEGORIZING, FOYT. YOU GET NOTHING!

I have seen the videos of this book and I have gagged and choked while watching them. Really, black facing? Go fuck yourself. Yeah, go do it. People like you, Foyt, disgust me.

Is this your measly attempt to make a book on 'reverse racism'? Because, let's face it, there is such thing as reverse racism. If you are a Hispanic person disrespecting a white person because of their skin color, you are racist. Same applies if the situation is vice versa.

There is absolutely reason this book should have been written.

Yes, I will admit, as a light skinned person, I haven't had to experience much racism, but when I see my best friend crying her eyes out because someone called her the 'n' word and I end up reading a book like this were black people are called COALS, it makes me want to punch someone.

Let's stop the racism. It's pointless, stupid, and hurtful. We are all people.

And Foyt, do not keep on writing such a racist series. It gives a bad example to young adults."
Revealing Eden,♡ Half Blood Prince ♡,"July 28, 2012",1.0,"i actually read this a long long time ago, and it invoked me to such anger, i can't believe i haven't put up a review for it.

well, since it was a very long time ago, i've forgotten much of what happened in the book. one thing that did happen [and quite consistently throughout the book] that i will never forget, though, was racism.

so.

1) Pearls. Ambers. Tigers-eyes. And then, Coals. That is blatant racism right there, smacking you in the face. Do you want me to believe that the term ""Pearl"" is supposed to, in any way, belittle or insult or put shame to the white class?

2) Man/animal hybrid loving? if that didn't just put up the squick factor, i'm not sure what did.

3)


I'm sorry, but you take out the ""question of race"" in a book that is race. And since Eden our PEARL is in a pseudo-relationship with Bramford the COAL, that makes our poor, subjugated, woe-is-me White Girl the ; while ugly, oppressive, monstrous Bramford the Black Guy is the .

4) This coming from a woman who's . I shouldn't be surprised by the author's frame of mind, though, sometimes does that to a person. I'd like to think - or hope, at least - that i managed to steer clear of that route.

I'm too harsh on her, of course. Being at a young age must have been traumatizing for her. Oh, it's not like she didn't have any friends at school and everyone avoided her because she was a POC; it's not like she couldn't get a job, or had to face sexual harassment at every street corner because of her skin colour; but with a term normally used for an African-American, and . So she what it feels like, you see? She what it's like to be on the brunt end of racism. So she when she wrote this book of reverse-racism."
Revealing Eden,Amber,"July 28, 2012",1.0,"This is how I imagine the idea for this story was born.

One stormy evening, Victoria Foyt was browsing her Tumblr blog, uploading pictures of herself and her best friend from last night's party. An hour later, much to her horror, Victoria's image had been reposted by a social justice blogger, calling her out for racism. Racism! She thought angrily, well I never! After sending a few angry anonymous threats to the Tumblr user, Victoria got off anon and said that she could use racist slurs as a joke whenever she wants, as this is Amurrcah, and she has the freedom of speech.

After telling her best friend Stephanie, who is also a racist, of her Tumblr encounter, Stephanie got serious. ""Well, she said you can't know what it's like to be a minority, right?"" Victoria nodded. ""Well then, let's show her. Write a book where white girls are considered so ugly that they have to dress up as black people just to get sex. My little sister has some makeup leftover from when she did her Pocahontas photoshoot, we can use that for the cover of the book. I am aware of blackface but this is totally different.""

Revealing Eden,G,"July 27, 2012",1.0,"A weakly-written white person's revenge-anxiety fantasy with a ridiculous premise, Revealing Eden reveals Victoria Foyt as a person no one should ever want to know.

Whatever you do, don't tell Foyt that whites have been the global minority since we began keeping track of the numbers; there's no telling how she would feel about this news.

The only thing more ridiculously over-the-top racist than ""Pearls"" and ""Coals"" as a way to refer to white people and black people is the trailer featuring a white woman in blackface. Skip this one, preferably across the waters of a particularly deep lake."
Revealing Eden,Whitley Birks,"December 4, 2013",1.0,"Dear sweet baby Jesus, that’s how long it took me to crawl through this book. I…I almost don’t even know what happened, because so much of it was just bullshit. Just…pages and pages of words, words that sort of came together to make sentences, but the sentences didn’t come together to make a scene. It was like reading stream-of-consciousness fanfiction written by someone going through pon farr. Nothing can beat the racism in this book for sheer disgust, but the rampant sexualization sure gives it the old college try.

The plot of the book is relatively simple. Eden is a research assistant, working for her dad, who is about to do some big experiment to make man/beast hybrids. She’s worried about getting married, because stupid. (A lot of things are “because stupid” and I’ll cover them later.) She’s got a boyfriend that she hopes will propose, and he asks her to some dance thingy, so that gets her excited. Once there, she gets harassed by some creeps, her boss rescues her, and then they go back to the lab where the human test subjects have gone missing. So her boss, Bramford, volunteers himself, instead. Halfway through, some militia group that Eden’s boyfriend belongs to shows up, and they fuck shit up. Eden decides that the best course of action is SET THE PLACE ON FIRE because…stupid. Bramford turns a little more animal than planned, but he and Eden and Eden’s father all escape in a plane. They fly off to the Amazon and hide in the jungle with a tribe called the Huaorani.

And then there’s literally 200 pages of bullshit where Eden just flails around like a moron, gets lost in the jungle, pouts, and goes on at length about how she’s now sexually attracted to Bramford. Also, there’s a mild mystery about some woman named Rebecca, and after far too long we find out that she was Bramford’s first wife, and she betrayed him to the militia once and then also died. Also, they have a son who’s an albino, which is a big deal because of stupid.

Seriously. 200 pages. In the last 50 pages, Eden tries to contact someone back in civilization to come get her, but it turns out to be her old fake-boyfriend and the militia instead, and they try to shoot everyone up, but some Aztecs (???) come out of nowhere and blowdart them to death. Then Eden and the albino kid get set to become half-beast like Bramford and go off living in the jungle. Because if you do an experiment on yourself to become immune to the #1 thing that kills everyone in your society…that makes you an outcast and you have to go live in the jungle?

Good god, where do I even begin? I guess the racism is a pretty good spot. The author claims to have tried to “turn racism on its head” and flip the roles around. First of all, the very concept is insulting. Want to portray racism? WRITE ABOUT A POC CHARACTER. This is basically saying that white people won’t care about injustice unless it’s applied to other white people. Which, yeah, that’s a big problem in our society. It won’t be solved by perpetuating it with more “poor whitey” stories. Second, this book fails pretty hard at what it set out to do. This isn’t racism “turned on its head,” it’s just regular racism. Eden hates the black people and characterizes them extremely poorly. It only gets worse when Bramford turns into a “beast” and they run into the “primitive” Huaorani. In short, this is our own, modern, white-superiority racism, just with the “unnatural” turn of having blacks be in charge of shit. It really does read as if the pure and good whites suddenly got “taken over” by the nasty, mean, bitchy black people, and oh, woe, isn’t that so terrible!!! Gasp, what a frightening turn of events! It’s wrong because it goes against nature and all that. *gag* I think part of this impression is because the book can’t help but give in to stereotypes about its black characters, and in part because it doesn’t realize what actually goes into institutionalized racism. It hits all the high points, but none of the subtleties.

And that’s not even getting into the few lines that make it completely obvious that Eden still thinks of herself as superior, regardless of what the book tries to tell us. Like:

Eden flinched. One of them was touching her. White-hot light exploded in her head. Before she knew it, she blurted out an incendiary racial slur.
“Get your hands off me, you damn Coal!”

Yup. Really. Eden thinks it’s an insult to be touched by a black person. She even flinches at it. Because black people are apparently just that nasty.

And of course, then there’s all the science fails. Supposedly this world comes about when “the Great Meltdown” happened, but we have no idea what that is. Now light-skinned people keep dying from “the Heat,” but we don’t know what that is, either. Heatstroke? Radiation from the sun is mentioned several times, but the few examples we have of “the Heat” make it seem like the victims are actually overheating, not dying from cancer or something. And if that’s the case (heck, even if “cancer” is the case) then it’s utterly ridiculous to say that darker people survive it better. Skin tone is not a body heat regulator. In fact, we’re not entirely sure why people developed different skin tones, but we do know it doesn’t have to do with temperature. There’s a few theories bouncing around; I like this one but there’s others as well. If the author had done even a modicum of research, even just to confirm what she thought she knew about ‘radiation’ and skin color, she would have found this out pretty quick.

Plus, everyone lives underground. Really. Underground, in a completely climate-controlled environment, with air-conditioning, never exposed to direct sunlight. And yet somehow white people get heatstroke but black people don’t, all because of this radiation that absolutely no one is exposed to.

And then there’s this whole “mating” bullshit. Girls have to have sex by the time they hit 18 or they get cut off from…um, free stuff? We later see one of these non-mated white women being forced into prostitution to make ends-meat, so is it that no one will hire her? Is everyone in the society living off government handouts? But…Eden has a job, so…is she banned from working if she doesn’t mate?

Eden’s ���mate-rate” is 15%, but we have NO FUCKING CLUE what that means. Really, none. A lot of drama is places on this number 15, but we don’t know what that number represents or how it was decided upon. There’s some hint that high or low ratings are an indication of your genetic fitness, but…later in the book Jamal goes on about how his rate went down because he was burned in a fire. Burns which do not affect his genetics at all. It affects his job performance and general fitness, I guess, since he had a very physical profession as a security worker before the fire. Is that what a “mate-rate” is? Your ability to be self-sufficient? Or… fuck, why am I still thinking about this?

Bigger problem with the mating issue: it makes no sense. Supposedly this is some ultra-unemotional society, where extreme reactions are dulled with a drug called “oxy” (we’re told this, never shown it) and resources are scarce. Yeah: resources are scarce. But if you don’t mate and make kids, you don’t get resources. Basically, if you don’t pop out children which will put even more of a drain on the limited resources, then you’ll be punished for it because resources are limited and can’t be wasted on your sorry, useless ass. What?

Note, by the way, that it’s only women who have a time limit. And that limit is 18. As soon as you become an adult, girls, your only job is to make babies. Men can do things like stay single and run corporations, but all your good for is making babies. If you don’t make babies, you either die or become a whore.

Once we get out of the underground part, 2/3rds of the book takes place in the jungle, around a race of real-life indigenous people. The book parallels real life in an almost creepy manner: the book says that they somehow survived in spite of “the Heat” and were only recently discovered to be still living on the surface; in reality, the Huaorani were “discovered” in the 1940s, along with the rich oil reserves on their land. In the book, the size of the Huaorani settlement isn’t made clear. We only see two families, and no indication is made of whether that’s all there is or if Eden just didn’t care about/notice anyone else. The main Huaorani character we interact with is Maria, who literally does nothing in the book except take care of her two small children and wait on Eden and her father. She’s servile and unassuming and, to all appearances, perfectly happy to play maid to these white visitors. She and her sister-in-law live in huts and keep small gardens and believe in fables and… Basically, it’s what a white person would imagine when thinking about a “simple, native” existence through fake-nostalgia-colored glasses. There’s not a hint of the Huaorani’s culture outside of a few nods to mythology, there’s no history for these two families or how their village came to be, there’s no sense that they are part of a larger nation made up of intelligent and independent people.

The Huaorani, by the way, are pretty god damn smart and have set up their own rights/activist group, fought for the right to live on their own land, been in legal battles with oil companies, and they’ve had a recent history fraught with conflict and controversy. They’re also made up of multiple tribes, and they aren’t a homogenous society of people who all agree, because you get varying levels of cooperation with both each other and outsiders. They are a complex nation of intelligent people with a rich culture and history, and with some extremely delicate issues that are currently still being fought over, but this author sweeps all of that aside and turns them into bland, grinning servants."
Revealing Eden,Katie(babs),"July 30, 2012",,"I really tried to keep an open mind while I read this because of all the reviews and controversy surrounding this book, but I had to DNF by page 30 before I lost my marbles.

The reverse discrimination set in a Dystopian future was too intense and uncomfortable for me to read because it started right away and doesn't let up.

Also making the heroine have ""black face"" and explain why her people, the Pearls aka the whites were considered less than second class citizens by the Coals aka the blacks just rubbed me the wrong way. Also the fact that the heroine had to mate before she turned 18 or would die or get killed was too misogynistic for me. A young girl doesn't mate with a man deserves to die? So not my thing.

Better to stop reading because my inner Hulk wants to smash something."
Revealing Eden,Nerdie,"August 14, 2012",1.0,"Ugg...who allowed this SHIT to be published? And I'm not even sorry either, this book is blatantly racist and offensive on SO MANY levels. And BLACKFACE!?? Really!??"
Revealing Eden,Kala,"August 2, 2012",1.0,"Okay, I made it to about 60% and I've skimmed the last 30% because it's so damn boring. I usually always try to finish a book, but it's just not going to happen. This book is one of the worst books I've ever read in my entire life.

Bizarre quotes/facts from the first part of this book:
* we've had black people referred to as ""they"" multiple times (her italics, not mine)
* the main character has a daydream about being able to hang out on a beach with only white people
* ""How many times had Eden heard it? White people were lazy good-for-nothings with weak genetics.""
* ""One of was touching her. White-hot light exploded in her head. Before she knew it, she blurted out an incendiary racial slur. ""Get your hands off me, you damn Coal!""""
* The government supplies everyone with ""Oxy"" which is a ""happy drug"" that everyone is addicted to (and I mean everyone).
* Eden's father calls her ""daught"" which is short for ""daughter"" ... what kind of nickname is that??
* ""I don't want my child to be all Pearl. I'd rather be dead than mate with one of my own kind.""
* Her mother had red hair and as such was called a ""Pink Pearl""
* ""Cottons"" (aka albinos) are apparently so disgusting that Pearls and Coals work together to tie an 8-year-old Cotton to a funeral pyre and killing him on TV


The basic plot is that Eden is the beautiful oppressed white girl (a ""Pearl"") who lives where black people (""Coals"") are beastly, evil, and treat Pearls like garbage. The evil black people are the majority because almost all the white people got skin cancer and died. In order to ""fit in"" and be ""attractive"" Eden wears blackface (oh wait, it's called ""Midnight Luster"" - that makes it better!). Eden spends the majority of this book concerned about being beautiful. There is an actual paragraph where she is having an inner monologue about how she wishes things could be better for Pearls so that she could be considered beautiful. Can she get any more superficial?

Eden's father is a Pearl scientist who is going to save the world by turning everyone into cat people - aka we are all going to look like this in order to survive:


Eden's father's boss, Bramford, decides to be the first test subject and is turned into a black jaguar man. Eden is attracted to him for some reason. There is a huge explosion or something in the lab and Eden, jaguar man, and her dad all escape to the jungle where a bunch of Spanish speaking Indians live. There are a bunch of chapters about Bramford carrying Eden around, roaring, killing monkeys for the tribe to eat, etc.



After about 50 pages of this, I lost interest and I just can't continue. I just can't finish. While Eden is still whining about wishing she were black so she could be beautiful, they aren't around any evil ""Coals"" anymore so the racist comments have been toned down.

There is a lot of controversy around this book and to be honest, I think most of it is founded. I believe this author thinks she is trying to do something good and make white people understand what it's like to be faced with racism, but she completely failed. All this book does is reinforce the bullshit racist stereotypes about black people being beastly, cruel, and stupid.

Even so, the plot denigrates into something so boring that I'd be surprised if many people finish it.

Eden is so superficial and selfish. All she cares about is herself and being beautiful. The love story so far is non-existant, outside of Eden swooning over catman every five seconds because he's so buff and manly. Those leathery claw hands really turn her on.

Please don't read this book. If you must, borrow it from someone. Do not pay money for this book - you will regret it."
Revealing Eden,Amanda,"August 3, 2012",1.0,"This book and the author are incredibly and overtly racist and sexist, whether she is conscious of it or not. I'm saddened that this amount of ignorance still exists in the world today. How could the author possibly defend what she has written? How on earth was this allowed to be published in this day and age? Why, in the name of all things holy, did she think promoting the book while using Black Face was an acceptable marketing plan? She calls the evil black overlords ""Coals"", the now-extinct albinos ""Cottons"" and the white characters paint themselves in a substance called ""Midnight Luster"" in order to ""pass"" as black, and yet she claims she fails to see any racist connotations in her work. On top of that, one of the black male leads, Jamal (seriously) is described as beastly and exotic evoking the ""Mandingo"" stereotype while the ""one nice Coal"" is named Peach and might as well have a big ol' sign on her saying ""Mammy"". Girls are expected to ""mate"" by the time they are 18 and it is their sole function in this world despite the fact that this dystopia is overpopulated and food is scarce. What makes it even more horrifying is that it's aimed at young readers.

There is nothing original or thought-provoking at all in this novel and the plot, character development and supposed science behind her world are flimsy at best. It's a poorly-veiled excuse to feed into old prejudices and fears and it's being promoted as kid literature. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and I think it should be removed from store shelves for its incredibly offensive nature.

This is an honest review of the book and not cyber bullying as Ms. Foyt claims on her Stop the Good Reads Bullies webpage. Thanks for making me first comment though. It proves to me that you're reading every single response on every single web page and are still refusing to apologize to P.O.C. for your hurtful words. I am white and I have never nor will ever experience racism because of that. I was raised and still live in a wealthy town in Canada and my words mean very little except to prove that people of all races find this book misguided at best and disgusting at worst. The author needs to be listening especially to P.O.C. because it is their voices that matter most on this issue, instead of deleting and ignoring their comments."
Revealing Eden,Nicky,"August 5, 2012",1.0,"I heard a lot about this book, and I couldn't quite believe that anyone would actually take this premise and run with it. So I downloaded a three chapter preview. To be fair to the book, I didn't find it in itself terribly written: predictable, and nothing that stands out from the crowd, but there is some world-building there and despite my horror at the premise, I could have read more without wanting to stab my eyes out.

I didn't want to, however, because the whole idea is so breathtakingly offensive. It's supposed to 'turn racism on its head', by making people of colour the ones with privilege and white people the underprivileged, forced to wear blackface. It's so appropriative of the experiences of real victims of racism, and so obviously written by someone who has held privilege all their life. It's heavy-handed and clunky, and just... I can only assume from reading it that the author is one of those people who talks a lot about reverse racism and denies the real amount of privilege they have.

It doesn't come across as the kind of book that could shed any new light on the issue of racism, or exorcise any demons. The people of colour are stereotyped and unsubtle, most of them barely even two dimensional. They're just evil, and you're meant to swallow that.

I don't really have words for how problematic I find this book. It could seem as if the author is saying, stop talking about the bad things white people did in the past, because if you were allowed to rule us, you'd be as bad or worse, and this is why we can't let you have power over us.

Obviously, I haven't read the whole book, but when the very concept is so troubling to me, I'm not going to pay for the full book and read it.

ETA: Realised I didn't say anything about the concept of white people being ""Pearls"" and black people being ""Coals"". I hear that there is actually some reason behind that in the author's mind (pearls are not valuable in this society; coal is) but that doesn't make it feel any less problematic when reading the book, especially as that is never articulated."
Revealing Eden,#ReadAllTheBooks,"August 3, 2012",1.0,"I think I know what you're wondering. Is this book as racist as people are making it out to be? In a word, yes. Yes it is. But do I think that Foyt set out to make her book this offensive? No. No, after having finished the book I think I can say that this is more an example of why authors should do their research and listen to their audience when covering real life problems (such as racism) that you yourself have never experienced. Despite Foyt's claims that she's been called a bad word during childhood, she has no true first hand experience of the type of racism she describes in this book. This doesn't mean that she couldn't potentially have written an apt description of racism, but it does mean that she should've done better research and spoken to people who have experienced it. Unfortunately that's not the only type of research she apparently didn't do, but more on that later.

First off, I have to say that this did have some entertainment value, although it definitely wasn't in the way that Foyt intended it. I kept reading this because it had this train wreck sense of fun to it, like how so many of us continuously look to see what Octomom or Snooki is doing now. Not because we particularly like them, but because we're so horrified by their actions that we can't help but keep watching. That's the biggest appeal of this book and if you're the type of person who likes that sort of book (this audience does exist- I'm one of them) then this is exactly up your alley.

But as far as the book itself goes? It's awful. There's so much unintended racism in this book that it fails to tell much of a message at all. It does have some educational value as a way of showing authors the value of research and what not to do, as well as warning people that stating that you don't see races (aka ""colorblind"") might just mean that you're only steps away from penning something like this and alienating a whole score of readers. (Seriously, did Foyt even put any thought into any of the things she has said so far?) One of the biggest signs that Foyt did no research into racism is that she really only focuses on the idea that someone has to be openly hostile and violent against someone to show racism. Yes, that's part of racism but that's barely the tip of the iceberg. Racism is also where people refuse to acknowledge you, move to the other side of the street because they think you're going to do something, avoiding talking to you, talking down to you... there's so many different forms of racism that aren't readily hostile. Sometimes you get racism in situations where people think they're being nice. Foyt never seems to grasp that concept here. I'm not going to list all of the various things in here that came across as racist since there's so many of them and they've been listed fairly well on various websites. All I will say is that Foyt does some serious stereotyping here without ever really thinking about it.

The lack of scientific research is fairly obvious in this book, as the amount of melanin in someone's skin won't matter much if you've got a solar ray blast that kills off almost all of the world's vegetation and leaves enough radiation/sunray gunk to where it'd practically melt an albino. Science doesn't work that way.

Where the book gets even more ludicrous is where Foyt begins to break and then outright ignore her own universe rules. We have the area around the cave system where everyone lives be a barren and scorched earth, yet there's abundant rainforest life elsewhere. At least I think it's supposed to be a rainforest. Since the Huaorani tribe is supposed to be in Ecuador for the most part, the rainforest in the book is most likely along the equator, which would be one of the places most hard hit by the solar blast. Rainforests are so insanely fragile that even the slightest change in sun, heat, or any number of factors would demolish it. Yet we have butterflies floating around. Again, science doesn't work that way just because you want to have your characters run through the rainforest. Another rule in the book that is broken quickly is the idea that Eden would quickly die in the sunlight. She doesn't and shows little to no signs of the Heat (aka really bad sunburn) for most of the book. Even an albino revealed later in the book gets exposed to the sun with no terrible repercussions. Now this might be a plot point but even if it is, this should've been mentioned at some point.

Another thing that sort of irked me with the book is that Foyt never seemed to know exactly which audience she was writing to. The interactions between Foyt and Bramford are devoid of chemistry, so we have lots of mentioning of lust and ""tingly feelings"" to make up for that. (I am still confused as to why Bramford was attracted to Eden at all, as she was completely unlikable and a jerk for most/all of the book.) The descriptions in the book aren't graphic, but at one point we have Eden grinding against Bramford's neck while she's riding on his shoulders. Granted, part of this was to urge him to run faster, but when you make mentions of the line ""like sweet, dripping honey"" from a Dickinson poem, you're going to get sexual connotations out of it. This might be tame in comparison to some of the other stuff out there in the romance section, but this is a teen book and you have to be careful about how you phrase things. Not all parents want stuff like this in their teens' novels, not because they want to teach kids that their bodies are dirty, but because they just feel like they should have books that don't include this. I've read more graphic stuff and I've read YA books where there's been sexual themes, but this just felt like it was stuff that was written more for adult readers than teens, if that makes any sense.

Overall I feel that one of the worst things about this book was that it had the potential to be more. Foyt isn't a great writer, but she's not a newbie making spelling and grammar errors left and right. She's clearly written before, which is what makes the research errors and plot holes all that much more glaring. It's also what makes so much of this book seem so racist: she's not really writing things she's fully aware of and it shows. If an 80 year old cloistered nun were to try to write a sex manual, I think it'd come across just as clueless as Foyt's writing does, which is the best comparison I can really make to this.

But should you read it? Well, there's some value to reading this for the reasons stated above. I just think that if the author was smart, she'd forego any further books in the series for right now and work on re-writing this one. (Although I admit that I'd probably check out the next book for the lulz.) All talk of racism aside, this book has some serious plot and character problems that need to be addressed. I've read worse, but that's no excuse for the universe inconsistencies and unlikable characters. I'm giving this a 1.5 for entertainment value, but it's just a mess.



I'm updating this because Foyt has recently published another blog where she tries to explain why she named black people ""Coals"". Her justification was that pearls are useless in this society (since you can't produce energy with them) while coal can be used for energy. She also stated other things about the book in an attempt to explain them, such as saying that there are limited resources and the Pearls are seen as a drain on resources, which is why they're so readily killed off and discriminated against. My reason for this annendum is to state that nowhere in the book does she explain any of the things in her book. Any of these could have helped to explain many things as well as defuse some of the more... ""interesting"" aspects of the book, but at no point is any of this mentioned. While I'm not trying to bully the author, this is a huge failing as an author in that you omit aspects like this. An explanation of these could've deepened the novel greatly if they'd actually been included. The problem is, now I've already read the book and no amount of further explanation will help fix the plot holes, mistakes, inconsistencies, and other flaws of the novel (NOT talking about the stuff that could be seen as unintentionally racist). This is why I stand by my thought that the book should probably be re-written and better developed. Explanations like this should be in the novel. You generally shouldn't have to explain the more basic concepts like this.

Revealing Eden,Alicia (is beyond tired of your *ish),"October 11, 2015",,
Revealing Eden,Dawn Vanniman,"May 14, 2012",1.0,"So this story is set in a future where the heat and sun have gotten ridiculous and the darker your skin is, the safer you are. Caucasians are now the minority due to their fragile skin and are called 'Pearls'. African-Americans are the majority and everyone wants to be a 'Coal'. So much so that Pearls cover their hair and skin with a makeup of sorts in order to be more 'average' and pretty. Also, in this world you must be marked to mate by age 18 or lose all resources on which to live.

Eden is a Pearl - she's whiny, self-centered and I kept hoping someone would off her...the sooner the better. She's 17 years old, but most of the time came off as maybe 12 years old and then I was icked out by the sexual stuff. Eden only seems to be concerned with mating and having children, yet she's described as being really smart. Not that you can't be smart and married with children - look at me! ;)

Then there's the men:

1 - her boyfriend Jamal - he's a Coal, but no one can know about their relationship. He seemed obnoxious right from the start.

2 - her boss Bramford - he's a Coal and acts distant with her, but at the same time he acts very sexual toward her.

No matter what, she seems to be fine with the domineering ways of the men toward her.

Spoilers:



Bramford is eventually genetically altered to be a jaguar/human hybrid. Suddenly, whenever he's near, Eden is hot for him. When he's not around, she seems to think he's a rotten person. Frankly, I'm weirded out by her being so hot over a part animal/part human...also by her letting men lead her around and not thinking.

The premise is a good one, but the characters were lackluster, the writing was stilted and the plot mechanics were awkward."
Revealing Eden,Toks,"July 29, 2012",1.0,"Hailing from the nonexistent category of African-American readers, I'm here today to say this book exceeded expectations.

It is even more awful than anyone told me or I could've imagined. I question why Goodreads won't let me just give this zero stars as an exception. In point form:

- Your world-building is bad and you should feel bad.
Now, I know everyone is jumping on the YA Lit dystopia bandwagon to become the next Hunger Games, but in the very least, you need internally consistent logic. Melanin is not a radiation filter.

- Eden makes Edmund Pevensie look sweet and even-tempered and Bella Swan merely misguided.

- You cannot have a race name double as a racial slur, and judging by everyone's reaction to Eden's outburst, Coal is not complimentary.

- On that note, really? Pearl is the closest you can get to derogatory but coal (a dirty pollutant) in an environmental dystopia is supposed to be good?

- With an issue like race in a position of privilege you have to be very delicate with how you choose to explore that theme. Foyt uses a sledgehammer.

- How many times can you describe your black male characters as overtly sexual and violent without feeling like you're NOT AT ALL subverting stereotypes?

- Also Eden can keep calling her black female boss doing her job, a bitch. Even when the men are cruel they're ~sexy~ but Ashina? That haughty bitch. That's really turning stereotypes on their heads you guys.

- If there is an imperative to mate and they need more children why would they limit everyone to a child each? That's not even replacing the parents.

- The father speaks like a bad Sherlock fanfiction. Stop calling your own daughter, Daught.

- The sentence structure is god awful.

- Bramford has a name even if he is part leopard. Eden knows him. Why would she start calling him El Tigre? Not to mention, in case I forgot, he is called beastly every third sentence.

- I'm going to let someone else handle the portrayal of the Native people in this book. “Residue from oil mining,” her father said, indicating the murky water. “My hypothesis is the tribe sold their oil rights long ago, probably for worthless cash. I suspect no one ever explained the consequences.”...nope.

- If anyone has special snowflake disease it's Eden. She's not an animal, she exclaims! She won't eat the Native people's food. It's like vomit, and she spits it out. She wishes she had meal pills! Wahhhh where is her Life-Band? Whine. Whine. Whine.

- ""Eden yearned to caress his savage face but feared he might hit her."" pg 97. This is not romantic. What is with modern YA Lit and romanticizing creepy situations?

- I have nothing to say about that mess of an ending or the preachiness of colourblindness. From a person of colour, who racism affects in the real world, this is a piss poor examination what racism is like. Also colourblindness is exclusively a white privilege because you can't be ignorant of something that systematically affects you. What on earth is wrong with acknowledging race and discrimination and its effects on others' experiences and actively being sensitive to such?

Edit:
- How could I forget the blackface? Which is both because Coals don't like looking at pearls and it's illegal or some such nonsense. She describes putting on red lipstick in a way to make her lips look bigger. Get it? Big lips. Because black people have them -_-"""
Revealing Eden,Lydia Presley,"February 5, 2012",1.0,"Original review posted here

I don’t do pure negative reviews very often – usually there’s some sort of saving grace in a book, a storyline I like, a character I admired, something I can pull from the book, but I can’t do it here.

Let’s look at the list of things that got to me:

1. Reverse racism. Foyt tried an experiment and, in my opinion, failed. Something that is a basic cornerstone of good writing is show, don’t tell. Don’t include a word and then reference it as being a “racist” term, in those exact words! There’s no need to turn history around to prove a point either. White-face bands? Reverse slavery/abuse? The whole idea just rubbed me the wrong way – especially since the idea for her earth was actually a good one, and so much could have been done with it that was fresh and new.

2. Beastiality. Have we gotten to the point that we’re angel/demon/vampire/werewolf/witch/mermaid/fairy -’d out? Do we really need to turn to beastial creatures to get that hot, romance-y, steam fix? I cannot tell you how much times “tail” was mentioned that seemed to get Eden all hot and bothered, and oh my goodness, it gave me the heebie-jeebies.

3. Plot. I couldn’t really find one. I mean, I could find a spoiled brat of a girl, but .. was the plot her intention to actually get away? or was it that she protests too much? or was it that.. you know, I don’t know. If you read this book, and like it, please tell me what the plot was? 75% in, I was talking about this book to a friend, and she asked what the plot was and it blew me away that I couldn’t articulate it.

I love dystopia books, I love science fiction, I love a good story with racial tension in it, it gets my mind working (Go read Tankborn by Karen Sandler). But, other than a spark of what could have been, I just didn’t find much of anything to like in this story."
Revealing Eden,James Tullos,"April 16, 2022",1.0,"I won't go over the racism, since other reviews already have. What few mention is how much this fails as a book.

There's no plot until the last 50 pages, Eden is an obnoxious protagonist, there are typos, and everyone is always high on oxycodone.

I felt gaslit by Eden's moodswings about Bramford, she goes from loving him to thinking about he's always been a monster to being horny in a single chapter, and her changes in mood are never acknowledged.

Well first of all the synopsis is ridiculous. It just jumps from one ridiculous plot point to another. Boo-hoo, ugly girl, here comes the Hunger Games referen-FATHERDOINGSOMEKINDOFSCIENYTHINGYTHATFUCKSEVERYTHINGUPPPP-beast mannnnn, he's a hot guy tooooo-ADOPTED AUNT SOMEWHERE IN THERE, BECAUSE REASONS.

Wut.


Something I find interesting about this book and the author, though mind you not in a kind fashion of the word 'interesting', is that she tries ever so hard to pass this book off as 'combating racism', even though the tactics she uses are about as useful to combating racism as Playboy magazines are for dead people. Not very.

One does not simply combat racism by using ridiculous premises which basically end up being racist themselves. I mean seriously, blackface? Coals? Black people being seen as monsters? White being the minority? Give me a break.

Since when is being a white supremacist apologist combating racism? The author, on her blog, pretty much stands up on her white shining pedestal and weeps 'Oh woe is me, I am white, and soon the world will be overrun by darker skinned people. Woe is me, I am white and in the minority'. Right. So all those many, many, MANY years of whites being assholes to people of other skin colours were just mumblings of your history teacher whose lessons you slept through. Racism has a history of progress (at least in some societies thus far). Turning the tables by switching the situations can't be done with coherent sense.

If you want to combat racism correctly, watch the movie AMERICAN HISTORY X. You might have heard of it. It stars Edward Norton, whom I'm sure more than one of you have masturbated to at some point. Yeah, he's awesome, isn't he? He sure is. A brilliant and dedicated actor. One of a fucking kind. Go and watch that movie he was in called American History X, and that's how you combat racism. The movie basically did it in a way that no class is shown as better than the other, but basically points out the flaws of the hatred both sides have for each other and ends up binding them together through this hatred, but not as people of different classes, rather as human beings. This book is just a silly attempt to be bold and anti-racist. But it's... so silly.

I kinda wish the book ends where the first part ends. Eden gets killed. The end. All is well.

Mrs. Foyt, I think you should take a nice long nap. Just... consider that before you write the second book of the series... and consider it again each time. Thanks."
Revealing Eden,Caddi Andersen,"April 15, 2012",5.0,"Revealing Eden is brilliantly paced--it's such a page turner and is extremely difficult to put down. I just kept thinking ""One more chapter--one more chapter.""

What I love about dystopian novels is their ability to make us look at ourselves and what the world can become if we're not willing to change--and author Victoria Foyt gets the reader to do exactly that. The premise of a post-apocalyptic world where, after a ""Great Meltdown,"" humans with lighter skin, aka Pearls, are at the bottom of the caste/class system due to a lack of melanin to protect them from the radiation given off by the overheated sun. Pearls are considered the lowest of the low and ugly, which makes it hard for them to survive, since due to limited resources and a government mandate, women must mate by their 18th birthday and men by their 24th or 25th.

The main character, Eden Newman, is on the verge of her 18th and desperate to find a mate so she can survive. Since she's in a secret relationship with a highly desirable man of a dark skinned race, aka the Coals, Eden hopes that she may have a chance, until a betrayal and misunderstanding throws her entire world into chaos.

I related to Eden very well and loved figuring things out at the same she did during the book. She grows immensely throughout, learning to accept herself and realize that she is actually beautiful. And in a world where true love seems to be a myth, she discovers that it may actually exist. The plot is well-crafted and extremely unique, and all the characters are believable.

The descriptions in the book are amazing and thorough, yet enjoyable to read and don't overload you. The elements of tension are incredible, which is what I think makes it such a page turner. It was hard not to think about how horrifying society could easily become--a world of extreme racism and danger caused by a deteriorated environment.

Foyt is now one of my favorite new authors! I can't wait for the second installment of Save the Pearls and look forward to what else she has in store.

Revealing Eden,Mikki Kendall,"July 29, 2012",1.0,"Read Revealing Eden yesterday & it is actually worse than I expected. Aside from everything else Foyt is a terrible writer. Her racism shines through on every page, but that’s about all that’s clear. Otherwise the plot is a mess, she peppers the book with scientific terms, but clearly doesn’t know basic biology, much less anything about DNA or genetic therapies. Add in the one dimensional characters rooted in stereotypes, the plot twist straight out of a soap opera, & the complete failure to build a believable mythos for her world & you can tell that any awards listed for this claptrap are purchased or simply made up. The offensive plot devices are all that make this train wreck remotely interesting & they’re not deployed with any skill. It’s poorly written, poorly plotted, & after a while it even fails at being offensive simply because it’s so boring."
Revealing Eden,Jennifer (Bad Bird Reads),"October 26, 2012",4.0,"Note: I decided to repost my review of this book. I originally took it down for the many cyber attacks I received for my opinion of this book. I understand many people view this book differently and are upset by how they interpreted the content. If I reread this book today, would my opinion have changed? Probably. But this review below was how I felt about the book a long time ago. I can't change that. I just ask that you please not bully or attack me anymore for my opinion. I respect how you feel about this book, please respect me back. Thank you.


The Good
Eden lives in a dystopian world where the darker your skin, the more desirable you are because those with dark skin can more easily stand the excessively hot environment that the earth now nurtures. Eden is a Pearl, a white person, which pretty much categorizes her as the dregs of society. Eden can only hope that a desirable Coal, a black person, will pick up her mate-option. But the story really begins when Eden and her father are swept away by Ronson Bramford, one of the most desirable and wealthiest Coals, and taken to a secluded part of the rainforest. This is after Eden compromises her father's vital experiments and Bramford is turned into something between beast and man. But Bramford's new transformation might be the key to helping society gain a semblance of what it once was, with everyone on more equal footing and with a better adaption to the environment.

To tell you the truth, I was scared out of my mind while reading this book. I always put myself in the position of the protagonist and to live in the world Eden lives would be like a death sentence without a defined date. To be so disposable and surrounded by people who hate your kind is just terrifying. But despite my fear, I devoured this book in one night. I don't often read dystopian type novels, but I have to admit this was a great introduction to the premise.

Eden was an interesting character that I couldn't help but feel sorry for. She tries to do the right thing but seems to always make things worse. Even though she has learned to be subservient and fear her superiors, she still has this inner strength that I think comes from her father's determination, her mother's love for life, and her ""aunt"" Emily's beautiful words. Oh, I can't forget to mention that. I think Foyt's concept of making Emily Dickinson Eden's ""aunt"" was wonderful. Her integration of Dickinson's poetry was quite fascinating. It brought a sense of realness to an otherwise fantastical world.

Bramford was a mystery most of the book. We can see that he views Eden not as a Pearl but as a woman, even when her childish actions say otherwise. But his past haunts him and his future is very much uncertain. He envisions a better world, just like Eden's father, but it has cost him some of his humanity. Though Foyt doesn't provide a very detailed description of what Bramford looks like after his transformation, I can't help but think of him as hot. It's the way Eden sees him that helps me visualize his undeniable masculinity and inhuman strength.

Watching Eden and Bramford fall in love was quite endearing. They couldn't be more opposite but they find something special in each other. It's as if they see the real person inside, the one each had to hide from the rest of society.

I think Foyt did a great job of writing a story that speaks to the many issues we face each day. How our culture defines what beauty is and what such beauty gets you. The issues of racism and the ever-increasing destruction of our environment and earth. The plot was intriguing, the characters were eye-catching, the action was amazing, and the concept was unique. Oh, and the mystery. Most of my question's didn't get answered till the very end, but I liked that. To keep guessing till the last turn of the page made it so much more exciting.

The Bad
It's hard to pinpoint exactly what I didn't like about the book. One thing that was a little annoying was that from the summary and blurbs about the book I was expecting a different story. With the emphasis of the Coal/Pearl relationship and dystopian type world, Revealing Eden didn't focus too much on this aspect. The majority of the book was set in the rainforest away from the oppressive society I assumed was going to be the focus of the book.

The other thing that bothered me, though this is probably just me, the relationship between Eden and her father was depressing and how it was ""resolved"" was very unsatisfactory. And I know Eden can be a pain in the butt but you can't fault her for the decisions she makes when no one would tell her the whole story or truth.

The Snuggly
We get some kissing and a little touching. This is a young adult book all the way, though we do get a little cussing.

Overall
Though young adult is not my primary source of reading material, I have to say this book surprised me. It caught my attention from the get-go and never let up. Though the story took a turn I wasn't expecting, I still enjoyed myself till the end. I can't wait for part two. And I wanted to thank Foyt for signing my copy. Revealing Eden was the first hard-copy ARC I ever received, and your message only made it that much more special. Highly recommended for all ages."
Revealing Eden,Shail,"May 18, 2012",1.0,"So I was really glad that I didn't pay for this book. It was not very good. Let's just start with the idea that the whole beginning of the book is about a chick putting on black face. I couldn't get over it. I thought it was silly. If you think about the premise of the book, it sounds completely ridiculous. ""In a world where you can't go outside, and you have to live underground, it's better to be black than white, so all the whiteys paint their skin black. But all that's about to change because Eden's dad has developed a drug that changes your dna to include that of a Jaguar so you can go out in the sun. The whiteys will rise to power again!"". That's what I thought while reading it. I just thought that whole thing was weird and predictable. Plus Eden really bothered me. She never thought about anything. She would jump to conclusions and not think things through. Then she was always whining about how she was ugly and she just wanted to be beautiful. It was really annoying."
Revealing Eden,Annabelle,"July 5, 2012",,"I'm going to make one thing as clear as I possibly can: I gave this honest review of my own free will, because I wanted to. I enjoyed this book. Yes there were some issues, some extremely racist ones, but I am a book blogger, not a politician. I gave a review of this book, and I'm not offering an essay. If you have problems with this book, I personally understand why. But attacking me is wrong and by doing so you are not helping to prove your point. It's easy to skip over my review and never read it. Two wrongs don't make a right, and hypocrites never win.

***FINAL RATING: 3.05 STARS***


I definitely enjoyed this book. Essentially a love story, it was sexy and unique. It probably wasn't the most inspirational story I've ever read, nor the most deep, but I found it to be exciting and fun. Even if, for all of my hopelessly romantic tendencies, I don't like most pure love stories, I really enjoyed this one.



Edens a bit naïve, but not so naïve that it's ridiculous. In fact, she's a pretty relatable character and I liked her a lot. She can be kind of annoying at times, and she puts herself down far too much for my taste, but I suppose growing up in a world like that would be pretty difficult and probably that outcome is likely.



I don't know. I mean, I just don't know. Sure, there's something a little bit sexy about him, but personality-wise he doesn't have a whole lot going for him. I just didn't have a burning passion for him. He did have an interesting past, and I did enjoy seeing how he got to be who he was.


Like I said, this book was essentially a love story.

So actually, the world-building was rather poor. Instead of fitting the love story into the world she created, Victoria built her dystopian world around the love story she wanted to tell.

That said, it's not bad. I would definitely have preferred to see more of the plot, but I still enjoyed the story that was told.

And the story wasn't entirely a love story. Although most aspects of the book led back to that, there were actually a bunch of other details too. There was actually a bit of a mystery, and parts of the past were uncovered agonizingly slowly.

I was definitely on the edge of my seat, always wanting to know what was going to happen next.


The romance develops in an unconventional way, but it does develop. It isn't too instalovey, which is nice to see. Sure, a little more development would have hurt, but the underdevelopment wasn't too poor. Obviously I think it could have used more development, as I've just mentioned that, but that aside, there was definitely chemistry and mutual attraction. It was interesting to see Eden's and Bramford's relationship slowly transform.


I actually really like Victoria's writing. Yes, I think she could have done more world-building, but I don't want to get caught up on that lest I ignore the parts that were done well. Eden was portrayed pretty realistically and her thoughts are a bit naïve but the point is always clear. I also think that the description was pretty good. The dialogue wasn't sparkling, but neither was it dull. Overall, lovely writing.


Honestly, I didn't care for the ending. I didn't like it . Looking back on it, I'm not even entirely sure why. All I know was that I absolutely was not a fan. I thought it should have ended differently. It didn't leave me dying to know what happened next, and I thought that it was kind of boring.


Will I read the future installments of this series? Most likely. I genuinely enjoyed this book, and I believe that there will be improvements in future books. Would I recommend this? Yes. It's not going to be for everyone, but if it sounds like something you'd enjoy, then go ahead and pick it up!

: I can no longer recommend this book, and I'm not going to be continuing the series.

FINE.

Revealing Eden,"The FountainPenDiva, Old school geek chick and lover of teddy bears","September 23, 2013",1.0,"If anyone wants to see how the racial role-reversal theme is handled, I suggest they check out Malorie Blackman's work. Noughts & Crosses is the book Ms. Foyt should have written. I'm hoping that more people will seek this series out and give it the critical acclaim it so richly deserves.

Sadly, this will be the book some authors who've been taken to task for not including more diverse characters in their books will cite as the reason why they don't. They will whine about those ""uppity"" PoC's who so obviously didn't what Foyt was trying to do. They will bitch and moan about ""artistic freedom"" as if such freedom should exempt an author from being taken to task when the epic fail they perpetuate has real world consequences. I'm kind of surprised the ""Coals"" weren't depicted wearing hoodies and drinking iced tea or listening to gangsta rap.

Firstly, it's a VERY bad idea to sell this book using a white girl in blackface or using blackface as some vehicle for the white characters to ""pass"" if one is trying to appeal to a wide variety of readers. And having black reader love this book (as Ms. Foyt claims in her op-ed on The Huffington Post) doesn't mean squat. I fail to see how this woman could not see how offensive her characterizations are, or how her readership (which would be diverse) would be affected. It's bad enough with all the whitewashing of book covers and the Twitter/TumblrFail surrounding Rue of being black. Add to that the latest fail surrounding the casting of Magnus Bayne from (the character is half-Asian, but Cassandra Clare has insisted that Bayne be played by an Asian actor) and it's like rubbing salt into a deep wound then adding hydrogen peroxide just for fun.

I expect Ms. Foyt to attempt to defend the indefensible, but what fascinates me about this D.W. Griffith 'Birth of a Nation' wet-dream is how the book's four and five-star reviewers got through this without thinking even once ""isn't calling someone black ""coal"" kind of racist? Just in case anyone's wondering: ""Pearls"" were the Caucasian characters and ""Coals"" were the (you guessed it) Black characters. How this could just roll off the mind like water off a duck is astounding. The fail just gets worse as the novel's ""heroine"" has nightmares about being attacked by blacks, or that said heroine has a black boyfriend who's depicted as ""a beast"", or fears that said boyfriend might ""hit her"". Of course we have heroine's father, the magical white guy who can save the world and save this poor girl from all the scary, nasty, savage ""darkies"", making the world all right again. None of this insanity made even the slightest dent? Hmm, privilege truly has its blinders.

To be fair, not even members of the Klan or Stormfront.org would like this book because the relationship is an interracial one, and well, we all know how they feel about , especially those between white women and black men. It's that BBC they fear (and no, I'm not talking about the British television channel, LOL)."
Revealing Eden,Nasty Lady MJ,"September 22, 2013",1.0,"Sorry, I don't think this book and I would get along. Here are some of the reasons:

1)Racist Implications: I'm sorry calling your oppressed class pearls while calling your other classes amber and coals rings alarm bells off in my head. Why? Pearl is suppose to be a precious gem, I get what that's implying book and I don't like it. Plus, there's the use of black face. Do I even need to discuss why this is wrong?


2) Bestiality: Okay, so he's not a total animal it says beast man. But still, the MC is attracted to a beast man who I imagine looking like some sort of Big Foot creature. And yeah, there are plenty of PNR books where the MC is attracted to another species. But usually that's when the PNR love interest is in human form.


3) Sexist Implications: Having to be mated by ones eighteenth birthday. Do I need to even go there what happened to feminism and being an independent woman?

So no me and this book would not work.

Update: So I've been approved by NG. I think I might give it a try only because I want to prove Foyt wrong that isn't just the cover of the book that drives me bat shit insane. Note, though I'm probably going to be half drunk when I read it. I think it's the only way I can possibly be able to read it without giving myself a concussion."
Revealing Eden,Laura,"July 27, 2012",1.0,"complete racist drivel. how do people still think blackface is okay?

and how about...instead of creating a fictional world in which white people oppressed, we actually listen to people of color's ACTUAL, REAL LIFE experiences? why does oppression have to be framed from a white (or straight or male) perspective in order for it to be taken seriously? that's completely messed up.

if you insist on reading about oppression framed from a white perspective, try Noughts and Crosses. it's written by a black woman who has ACTUALLY experienced racism and oppression."
Revealing Eden,Jess,"March 6, 2014",3.0,"The dystopian novel is one of the most popular subgenres in YA literature. I recently had the opportunity to read the novel ""Revealing Eden"" written by author Victoria Foyt. This book was an unexpected surprise, given the variety of issues that emerge during the reading.

Eden is a pearl in a world where the coals are the ruling class. Pearl and Coal are racial epithets used by people in this society. She lives in a society where human beings are valued according to their phenotype and how pigmentation makes them fit to survive the environmental conditions. In this society where Eden lives, each individual seeks a mate to ensure the survival of the species. When people are knowing each other, before asking questions like what is your favorite music? or What colors you like? they prefer to know their genetic analysis and if they possess features that could improve an offspring.
Eden is a pearl, a person with caucasian pigmentation. A caucassian can hardly survive the onslaught of the sun on their skin and the temperatures. The pearls are kept sheltered in a facility without receiving contact with sunlight. For their 18 birthday they must have a partner chosen to procreate and continue the species, so they can continue receiving those things that need to continue living. Eden is close to its 18 years, and although she is brilliant, his genetic analysis gives her only 15% of aptitude as a mate. She is yet to found a partner that complements her. She has only received interest from a young coal who works in charge of security at the site where Eden and his father, a scientist, works. Blinded by this opportunity and desire to find a mate, Eden reveals her father’s work without even realizing it, detonating a drastic change in their lives.
Eden was forced to leave her life behind and start learning to survive in another environment and other circumstances. Her life is going to be impacted by a quasi-supernatural and fantastic creature, born of a genius scientist, who will redefine her preconceptions about herself, about her feelings and about about what is beauty.

About the book
The cover of this book is interesting and intriguing, gives a clue to the theme of the story, but never gives it away. The image in front is striking and captures the reader's interest. The plot developed in this post-apocalyptic totalitarian society book is characterized by interesting plot twists, and the discussion of a variety of issues.

The novel provokes reflection on several issues of current importance:
A caste society- individuals are classified into groups according to their value in society. This value is assigned according to the pigmentation of the person and how fit they are in order to survive. These groups are named based on racial slang.
Racial equality - society is governed by rules that seek to maintain order subjecting the less fit for survival in obedience by developing low self-esteem in people.
Ethics in science: Genetic manipulation - To what extent might be acceptable or even necessary genetic manipulation? Or is it unacceptable?
Resource conservation- conservation of resources to provide adequately for a population of individuals who prove to be useful in that society. The utility in this case lies in reproductive potential to produce individuals capable of surviving.
Environmental impact- damage to the environment /atmosphere caused social change.
The world where these characters interact is one that clearly shows a racial divide. The beads have lived for generations indoctrinated to think that they are less than the ruling class, the coals. For much part of the book, Eden sees herself as ugly and worthless. Only when she abandons society, she begins to know herself and show others her genuine self.

What do I think about Eden?
Eden initially underestimates herself. She is brilliant, but in turn, completely naive. Only wanting to find a partner to survive and not be released outside and die because of the temperature. True her ordeals she finds herself.

Revealing Eden,Nemo ☠️ (pagesandprozac),"February 1, 2019",,"if you want a book where racial dynamics are switched, instead of this clearly racist bullshit,i would highly recommend Noughts & Crosses, which is written by a black woman and has actually good socio-political commentary.

also, if anyone doubts that this is racist, the author literally said:

""Conceivably, if the book had not reached the African-American community of readers, if such a category still exists, perhaps there might be some backlash.""

""if such a category exists???"" ah yes. i forgot black people can't read.

also, ""pearls and coals?"" even in this society where whites are inferior, they're compared to beautiful rare jewels and the blacks are compared to a dirty common stone? LMFAOOOOOOOO OK we all know what you're tryna do here Foyt

also the blackface on the cover lmao Y I K E S imagine being this tone-deaf

anyway i know this book is Old News but some people are stumbling upon it on twitter and i just wanted to use this space to highlight how good Noughts and Crosses is lmao anyways i'm out byeee

Revealing Eden,Lisbeth Avery {Domus Libri},"July 30, 2012",1.0,"I really feel like going: This is bad. Why? BECAUSE IT IS! But I can't do that since it's bad and all. ... I think.

The idea was interesting. The heat didn't seem to be such a big thing though. It was more about Eden and beast-man. Even the saving father seemed like a subplot.

This book was painful. I finished it because I wanted to see if there would be a she-cat. There was. But there was no description so it was a waste of time.


Eden was vain, selfish, and stupid (not to mention all the things I want to call her). From the moment she really looked at the mutated Bramford (who turned into Jaguar Man - yes they actually called him that) she kep calling him sexy and handsome, though she continued to comment on how much she hated his attitude.

Magically, they're in love by the end.

I'm still trying to figure that one out.

I did like how she knew all the animal's scientific names. I found that interesting and unique.

Bramford was a jerk, a power-hungry jerk. There wasn't anything I found good about him other than the obvious awesomeness of having some jaguar DNA. Other than that, he was less than great.

The father was an entertaining character, but nothing special. He seemed to not care about his daughter til around the last 20 pages.



The plot was interesting in the beginning, I wanted to see how Foyt managed the segregation idea and jaguar DNA thing was cool. Then the book turned out to be Eden finding someone to mate with. And I mean it. She kept commenting on how she needed to mate and she'd never do it and was bound to live a sad, lonely life.

The author didn't seem to know what she was writing at times. The FFP are ""a militant organization of Coals [darker skinned people] that vowed to rid the planet of Pearls."" Then, a few pages later:



That was the biggest problem with continuity I found.


The writing was simple. She said, he said, they did, blah. Pretty basic.


Liked:
◘ Interesting plot idea
◘ Fun setting
◘ there's a jaguar dude in idiot

Dislike:
◘ Characters
◘ Failed plot
◘ the jaguar dude is an

I didn't like this book (not by a long shot). I really don't recommend this book unless you like damsels in distress, jerk love interest, boring plot...

Revealing Eden,Fangs for the Fantasy,"July 31, 2012",1.0,"As you can see, Eden Newman, the protagonist is a White woman who wears blackface. Eden does this because from a post apocalyptic earth, where Pearls (read: white people) are oppressed by Coals (read: blacks). Because of the higher levels of melanin, Coals were better able to survive the harmful suns rays.

""Of course, the dark races got The Heat too, but not nearly as often. The higher amounts of melanin in their skin protected them from the sun's radiation. Since their numbers hadn't been decimated in the Great Meltdown, as the other races had, they now ruled the planet."" [page 14]

I cannot begin to tell you how horrifying the very concept of this book is. How this White woman thought this role reversal would read as anything more than appropriation and racism is absolutely beyond me.

Foyt even goes as far as to include a scene where Pearls perform in White face.

""On the main stage a band of Coals performed in Whiteface. Eden's sensors told her their name: The Lost Caucasian Tribe. [page 40]

So it's not bad enough that we have a protagonist tromping through the majority of the book in Blackface and whining about the fact that she is White and no-one sees the real her, but Foyt decided to appropriate Blackface. In this scene, those performing weren't othered and it did not read as a minstrel show. There was no historical meaning to this supposed whiteface and it only served as yet another reminder of Hoyt's racial ignorance.

Asians are referred to as ""Ambers"", which essentially calls their skin colour yellow and is offensive. We are told on page 11 that Pearls is the racist name for Whites, yet this is the word that Foyt uses for the entire book to describe White people. They are also referred to as ""earth-damned Pearl"" and ""White death."" Suddenly this reversal of power means that there are racial slurs which effect White people and futuristic or not, this flies in the face of human history. It is further troubling that though we are told that the term Pearl is indeed a slur, so is Coal. This tells me that Foyt has no idea how a slur really works. A dominant group is not effected by a slur and the fact that she chose to give slurs to every racial group, undermines the supposed superiority that Coals have. If Coals were the oppressive force that they are supposedly cast as, Coal would not be considered a slur, just as honky, gringo, cracker and paleface aren't slurs today."
Revealing Eden,Becky,"January 5, 2012",4.0,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
Save The Pearls – Revealing Eden is a Dystopian novel which came across as a mixture of ‘Nought’s & Crosses’, ‘Matched’, ‘Divergent’, ‘Beauty & The Beast’ and ‘Romeo & Juliet’, all great books and it made for a good read.
Eden is a ‘Pearl’ the name for White people, in a post apocalyptic sort of setting, there aren’t many white people left and those that are around are viewed as low class, practically worthless. In this society, the darker your skin – the more respect you have.
Eden’s father, although a Pearl, has a high positioned job because he his a scientific genius and he is just about to discover a genetic modification that could change the future of the world.
When the world Eden knows comes under threat, and the people she thought she could trust turn on her she has to decide whether to follow her heart and save herself or end up fighting to save the future of humanity.
I liked Eden as a character; she’s strong willed and can fight her own corner but also has her weaknesses. In fact she starts out a little bit whiney but that means you get to see her grow and adapt and I enjoyed going on the journey with her.
I couldn’t stand her father, he was so self absorbed, I wanted to reach into the pages and slap him, shouting ‘pay attention!’ but I think that is what the author was trying to convey and she did a fabulous job.
Bramford is intriguing, he’s one of those who your never really sure what side he is on, but I really liked him, even as a bad-guy I felt a connection, so I knew what I hoped he would turn out to be.
The plot is fast paced and exciting, there are a lot of unexpected twists and turns. I finished this in one day; I just couldn’t put it down. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I can’t wait for book 2. I hope it’s out soon.
Exciting start to a great new series."

Thanks to Kensington Books and Netgalley for providing me with a copy of this book so I could post this one star review with actual knowledge of just how awful this book is.

If you looked at the blurb for this book and thought to yourself ""this is a joke, right? It's April Fools or something"", just wait until you read some of the actual book. Oh god. I won't even deign to quote. But no, this is not one of those books where the disillusioned lead goes to college and, I don't know, learns something. Instead, the author—who hasn't set foot on a modern college campus, probably ever, and certainly has never met anyone who went to college—gives us exactly the example of a snowflake paradise we can expect of someone who thinks that just because we want to learn, we can't be brave. Snowflakes don't know what to do besides melt when it gets warm, or some shit.

Fuck that noise.

Trigger Warning,Ives Phillips,"December 4, 2021",,"Was not worth entering the separate giveaway for, even in my pursuit of expanding my literary tastes.

It's a plot that falls flat on its face when one considers that gun control-- the thing that so-called ""ultra-lib special snowflakes"" are pushing for-- would have prevented the entire thing, thus rendering a story useless to exist.

It reads as a gun-humping conservative's wet dream, basically."
Trigger Warning,Jasmine,"January 8, 2019",1.0,yikes I think the fuck not
Trigger Warning,Jeninne,"January 20, 2019",1.0,"So full disclosure, I wouldn't have even known this book existed (and probably would have been better for that) if my queen Jenny Nicholson hadn't done a review on it. I knew about 2 minutes into her review that I HAD to read this book for myself, because there was no way it was real. There was no way this kind of book was actually real.

Spoiler alert: it's real.

And I'm kind struck between this being the best comedy I've read in years, or the most ineffective racist/sexist rhetoric and propaganda I've every experienced. I submit to you all, I had once wondered what reading Fox News would feel like. Can now confirm, just as terrible as having to listen to a couple of minutes of it at the gym while I'm fumbling the TV controls to try and get to TNT for my Supernatural at 6 in the morning.

With even more disclosure, I guess because this is a politically charged book, I suppose it's only fair to state that I am a registered democrat, and I'm pretty liberal in general. You know, I believe that people should be able to feed their kids, and make more than $12 an hour, and marry who they want, and use whatever bathroom they want. Basic human stuff. But I also think there's a better way to write a book with a more conservative standpoint than what's offered up here. I think there's a skillful way to make a point with literature, regardless of what that point is, with subtly and nuance, and things a good writer has in their arsenal.

Apparently Jonstone is a very prolific writer in the western genre, at least according to Goodreads. Can anyone confirm in those books that he's a decent writer? Or did he just lose his marbles for this book, and turn into a conservative edge lord and go ham with nonsensical run-on sentences, fragments that make no sense, paragraphs that share no common threads, characters that seem defined by their political stance and not ...personality, vocabulary that's taught in elementary school, and the general writing skills of someone who is more used to angrily writing comments under SJW videos on youtube, and not an actual author.

Because oh my god, excuse the subject matter, Johnstone is just a bad writer in this book. He's just terrible. He'll do this odd thing where he'll lead the reader down a train of thought, setting them up for expectation and payoff, only for the narration thread to suddenly be dropped like it meant nothing. Paragraphs don't flow smoothly into each other. They lack cohesion. Chapters rarely feel like they're meant to be read back to back, and within those chapters, content is introduced, dumped, reintroduced, and incoherently presented in such a chaotic way, that I swear to god I could get confused going from paragraph to paragraph.

In general, the writing in this book is more than just bad. It's downright terrible. How could Johnstone even think of presenting an argument, without the basic skills needed to do so? I wanted to go through and reedit this book. I wanted to rewrite parts of it so I could follow what was happening. And most of all, I was just disappointed that I couldn't really be the self-righteous bitch I wanted to be with this book. Because making fun of this book would be like making fun of a special needs kid. You can't do that. That's not cool. And clearly William Johnstone writes like he's special needs.

I guess what I can say about the content of the book is that it's highly, HIGHLY offensive from a human standpoint, let alone a political one. The book is filled with extreme misogyny. Women are presented as fickle, ignorant, manipulative, or often frail and easily abused. The author takes special note to highlight how women want to be protected from the big, bad world, but also want to protect themselves, so how dare they want to have their cake and eat it too! Like, it feels like the author is personally offended that women don't need men to hold doors open for them anymore?

(I'm totally into that, though. Just saying. I think it's sexy as hell when my date holds the door for me. Oh no, you guys! I'm not a special snowflake anymore! The feminists will kick me out of their club now!)

The author is also extremely racist at times. There's a lot of Fox News/Trump rhetoric about people of color and what a threat they are, or how they're terrorists. I will assume this very white author falls into the camp of people who believe that the Mexicans coming across the boarder are going to take his job! Or, you know, take all those coveted jobs out in the fields picking strawberries that white Americans are just lining up to fight for. The author often seems to try and camouflage his own racism by imparting it on the main character, Jake, but the author is about as successful with that, as making me believe that this author has EVER been to college and knows what it's really like.

I just … I don't know what to do with the content of this book. I think it's more than fair for someone to disagree with a political standpoint. And it's more than fair to argue for their own on the platform of their choice.

But this book is thinly veiled racism and sexism. It's fear mongering, and tasteless, and honestly, I'd probably be very, very pissed off if I identified conservative. I'd probably be going for blood if this idiot was representing my political party in any way, and was muddling things so badly it's unclear if this is just pre-Nazi rhetoric, or satire from a troll.

(Is this trolling? Come on, seriously, this has to be trolling. I mean, I know there are people like this that exist in real life, but this has to be trolling. It has to be. IT'S TOO BAD NOT TO BE TROLLING.)

This book is classless and trash, and we haven't even gotten to the plot of the book, which involves an on campus shooting. Which, I should point out, is handled so poorly, and so offensively, that I feel like I personally have to apologize to anyone who has had to endure gun control failure, or the loss of a family member due to such a tragedy. Because this author uses a school shooting as a tool to shake his finger and people and say, see, if you didn't coddle your children so much, they wouldn't be bullet sponges. Because that's how it works in real life. Want bullets to bounce off you? Don't let your sons do girly stuff like play with dolls or wear pink. Want your daughter to not end up shot when a disgruntled male student with psychological issues turns a gun on a class room? Teach her not to be a whore and tempt men! (You know, what you hear on Fox News every night).

I decided I had to read this book because I wanted a good laugh. I wanted to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon laughing at people being easily triggered at the idea of other people being easily triggered. Sometimes it's fun to laugh at the idiots.

But I ended up just being disturbed, and unsettled, and saddened in a way.

Politics are a hard thing to handle sometimes. You don't want to offend people, but you also don't want to back down. You don't want to make a situation tense, but in this climate, it's hard not to have a lot defined by what's going on politically.

Yet there is never an excuse for the kind of inhuman trash that you find in this book, and I'm still salty you can't rate a book lower than a one.

Trigger Warning,Kelly Rice,"January 17, 2019",2.0,"In the interest of full disclosure, I wanted to read this because I thought it would be pretty funny - and it is.

But I don't think that was the author's intent.

Jake Rivers is a former Army Ranger, independent scholar, and apparently some kind of magician as he managed to both earn a bachelor's degree AND go straight into the Army Rangers fresh out of high school. Oh, a move he had to make because he got into trouble with the law. He's a good guy! He's a rebel! He's the misunderstood hero with a heart of gold!

Jake's wealthy and well-connected grandfather gets Jake a spot at the local college where Jake's grandfather is also a major donor. As soon as Jake arrives he's confronted by a comical amount of people who epitomize the most extreme forms of liberal politics. These cartoonish students and faculty members provide a way for the authors to pepper in a liberal amount of buzzwords like 'triggered', 'safe space', 'microaggressions' and the like. But while the characters are meant to be so different, many of them almost immediately also make it clear they aren't immune to Jake's charms. His flirting - and ultimate connection - with a professor had me literally laughing out loud in places.

Politics aside, the story itself - terrorists burst in and hold an entire college building hostage - doesn't hold much interest. Jake, of course, jumps into action, almost effortlessly thwarting the villains and teaching those granola students a few lessons in the meantime! XD

In terms of a D-thriller, Trigger Warning hits the mark. It's over the top and peppered with people and situations straight from a Made for TV Movie. The writing itself is clunky and sometimes a but hard to follow but it makes up for that in cheesiness.


Heavy handed political satire about a problem that doesn't exist. Perfect for those looking for a laugh ... or desperate to reinforce their biases."

I simply cannot fathom how or why ANY publisher would pick this book up, much less Penguin Random House. Needless to say, I am side-eyeing them and not just for the content. I have seen more cohesive pieces put together by high school students who do the least to just scrape by. Save your time, if you get it free. Save your time AND money if you don't.

I read this book for a laugh. Kind of like watching a bad movie to make fun of it and laugh at the incompetency and strange technical and plot decisions.

Anyway, the book doesn't disappoint in its, um, crazy perspective of the EVIL LEFT!

In chapter one (just about seven pages), the main character, without doing anything, gets called a fascist, an oppressor, gets accused of ""perpetuating stereotypes of spreading toxic masculinity,"" and gets randomly attacked by roaming group of black clad antifa. That's just the first seven pages.

Lmao.

Anyhoo, in all seriousness, the title and description of this book sounds like it's some kind of joke, a parody against ultra-wokeness and all that. I'm not a Neo-Nazi,. nor do I support racism, homophobia, sexism, and so on and so forth. Most people would say I am more liberal than conservative in my leanings.

But I do NOT care for 'speshul snowflake' culture. I will never use ridiculous xenogender pronouns, or respect anyone who refers to themselves as otherkin, nor do I think anyone is immune from criticism, and I do feel that 'safe space' and 'my triggers' are way overused and abused.

I know some people might be wondering why the hell I'm explaining this, but I thought that I should clarify that I'm not a ""snowflake"" or whatever, and that I am reviewing this book with a fairly moderate POV.

Or more accurately, I read the Kindle preview of this, so I can't say that I read the WHOLE book, but the Kindle preview was more than enough for me.

And oh my god. This isn't a joke. This is truly an awful book by someone who is so far on the other side of the spectrum from the snowflakes he so despises that he's just as bad, if not worse than said snowflakes. His characters are borderline parodies of themselves and the ideals that they're supposed to represent, such as femi-Nazism or toxic masculinity or neo-liberalism and whatever bullshit.

This author is seriously unhinged and seems to be more triggered than the triggered people he hates, and does himself and his ""cause"" more harm than good with this book."

Trigger Warning,BookAddict,"August 1, 2018",4.0,"Jake Rivers is trying to decide what to do with his life now that he's a civilian. Being a ex army Ranger doesn’t give him a lot of marketable business skills, so at the urging of his grandfather, a major benefactor of Kelton College, Jake decides to pursue a graduate degree at the liberal arts school. It’s quickly apparent that Jake's values and beliefs are part of a silent minority at the school, but he fully intends to fly under the radar, keep his opinions to himself, and focus on obtaining a biology degree.

When an altercation between a woman and her boyfriend turns physical, Jake's training and principles won’t let him turn a blind eye. His intervention results in an attack by masked assailants, and Jake has no choice but to defend himself. As the videos of the attack go viral, Jake becomes the most famous pariah on campus and the poster child of every social issue the students and faculty fight against, But when terrorists attack the college, Jake becomes pivotal in thwarting their plan and protecting his fellow students and faculty, and all social platforms and political ideology take a back seat. Just in case there might be any confusion as to where the players stand on the issues, the author makes it abundantly, annoyingly clear. The first time, it’s clever. The second time it cements the concept, the third is redundant and the fourth is just hitting the reader over the head with it one time too many.

This book came to my attention when comments about it showed up in my Twitter feed. My curiosity was piqued and I was intrigued by the plot and thought that the story would either be an epic failure or a touch of genius. I requested an advance copy from Kensington via NetGalley and determined to approach the book with an open mind, setting aside my personal beliefs. Knowing I would be posting a review, I thought that an objective approach would be most useful to other readers. If I was reading reviews in consideration of buying this book, it wouldn’t be pertinent to me who the reviewer supported in the last election, but I would care about what he or she thought of the book – the plot, the storyline, the character development and the writing style.

If this book's premise doesn’t interest you or you’re put off by it, don’t bother wasting your time and money on it. I thought the author did a good job with the plot, and the storyline clipped along at a good pace and easily kept my attention. I really liked Jake's character, with his unflappable determination and quiet strength. I got a kick out of the “Die Hard"" references and actually liked Jake's character better for his understated bada**ness, and I loved the twist at the end. Although I felt a bit battered from having some of the points hammered on to such a degree, I appreciated the message that, when things are desperate enough, ideology is abandoned and enemies become friends in order to save lives and combat evil.

I do have to give props to the author and publisher for putting this kind of story out there in today's political climate. It’s a gutsy move and I doubt there will be any ambivalence on the part of the reader – you’ll either love it or hate it. The author's stance is abundantly clear so this book will best be enjoyed if the reader puts aside any political and social bias before digging into it. Otherwise, it will serve no purpose other than to raise your blood pressure and increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke, and there are plenty of other things in life that have that effect without actively seeking them out.

For the most part, I enjoyed this book, but clearly there were some things I had issues with. As for the book being an epic failure or a touch of genius, it fell somewhere in the middle. So why a four-star rating and not one or two stars? I’ve been very careful to try and give an objective, unbiased review, and in my experience with posting reviews on Amazon, this rating gives the review a better chance of staying on the front page and having more visibility. I’m a firm believer in gathering facts and making my own determination, rather than simply believing what I’m told, and I’ve done my best to assist you in making your decision about choosing to read this book or passing on it.

Trigger Warning,Mike & Lori M,"November 26, 2021",5.0,"CRAK! BIFF!
BLAM BLAM BLAM!

Woo! We really kicked some straw-man butt here didn't we?

Co-authors William ""Deceased"" Johnstone and live niece Jasmine Aaliyah ""J.A."" Johnstone* erect an impressive horde of straw-man lefties to stand against our heroic loner as he defends a college full of delicate snowflakes from some bad guys. By the end, though the straw lies thick across the campus, Jake Rivers, the good guy - who is big - manages to save most of their misguided lives - which are small, but spared. (No spoiler. If you're surprised, you're trying to read too far above your grade.) Lots of action, thrills, romance, political commentary, and blood-soaked clothes smearing down walls. Some brains too: not for thinking, for splattering. It's all quite educational, if you don't normally consume conservative media.

Five stars, then, for the publisher's genius in using Jasmine* and zombie author Uncle Bill to expose and ridicule the puerile worldview of American conservative populism.

Sadly, the five stars can't stand. Points are adjusted as follows.











Final score: three stars. Worth a read if you're in a funny mood, but don't spend any money on it.

EDIT to add: 1.99 stars restored for the publisher stealing Gaiman's title. Cool move.

A former military man named Jake Rivers returns to college to get his graduate degree, but what he hasn’t counted on is the change in the college atmosphere. Being a bright young man and usually knowing who the enemy he is fighting against, he enters the college scene where political correctness is the only acceptable means of any type of speech or behavior. Those who showed a different opinion like Jake alerted the college professors and other students that he wasn’t going to adhere to their ridiculous rules. They try several forms of intimidation. However, the “powers that be” must be careful of their treatment of Jake as they don’t want his grandfather pulling his monetary support of the college. What begins to happen is so out of left field that Jake feels as though he must soon decide whether to finish his degree, leave, or pursue something different elsewhere.
Readers of thrillers, suspense, military or political themes will really enjoy the action in this engaging book! Johnstone has out done herself with this story. People will want to remember that while it is fiction I could easily see it being real on college campuses today. Those who love America and the fans of Johnstone books won’t want to miss the latest and best coming from the pen of a Johnstone!"
Trigger Warning,Sean,"July 16, 2020",5.0,"TRIGGER WARNING tells the story of Jake Rivers, a former Army Ranger who enrolls at fictional Kelton College in search of a good education. What he finds instead is an endless parade of left-wing propaganda and an undisguised loathing for anything that deviates from the prevailing liberal ideology. Soon Rivers discovers a terrorist cell has infiltrated the College community, stoking the fires of partisan hatred to violent levels while setting the table for a ruthless attack that could literally wipe Kelton off the map. Can Rivers figure out what the terrorists are really after and stop their unhinged leader before it's too late? Read the book to find out!

As not only a former student but an employee of a private college not altogether unlike Kelton, this reviewer can readily attest to the reality of the leftist bias which dominates today's academy. Johnstone does a good job capturing the essence of the modern collegiate mindset and then amping it up exponentially thanks to the machinations of the terrorists who have chosen Kelton as their target. Rivers is an extremely likable protagonist and his Ranger background gives him the tools to fight back when the terrorists make their move. Johnstone keeps the action moving and there's never a dull moment as Rivers fights to keep himself and the rest of Kelton College alive. TRIGGER WARNING is great fun and shines a much needed spotlight on the sad state of contemporary higher education. A thrilling read for all fans of action and adventure."

I’m going to keep talking about that for most of this review so if that bothers you don’t read.

Yeah, I’m not exaggerating, Onision decided to write a book with an eleven-year-old protagonist who has sex with his fifteen-year-old girlfriend. While that could maybe work in a story about abuse, that’s not how it’s portrayed here. Onision writes sex scenes with graphic detail and in a manner clearly intended for titillation, not to mention that their romance is treated as some sort of great love story rather than a literal pedophile sexually abusing a child under her care.

In December 2020, the owners of Pornhub removed the bulk of the videos on their site since a lot of them were child pornography, content that people didn’t want shared, or just straight up rape. (Don’t praise them, they’ve sat on that shit for years and only got rid of it due to mounting financial pressure.) can’t be removed from the internet, nor can I sue Onion Cyan for emotional distress, nor were any actual children were harmed when he wrote it, so nothing like that will happen here. Yet I’m filled with an unceasing urge to punch him in the balls until my hand breaks. Onision is like Nobuhiro Watsuki, only with none of the talent needed to distract from the fact that he’s an actual fucking pedophile.

I was unsurprised by all of this, I knew what I was getting into before I started reading. Nonetheless, I hated it. No, I won’t go into detail about the plot that resembles a cobweb, the main character who just has the powers of God for no reason, or the part where Greg’s self-insert murders his girlfriend’s father, go to someone else’s review for that.

After reading this I can never have sex again."
Reaper's Creek,Phaedre,"July 14, 2019",1.0,"Allot of these reviews seen personal to the author. I don't know who he is, but he still deserves the 1* ratings.

I have never in my life read a book so awful as this. Whomever left it in the charity shop must have hated people and wanted to share their suffering.

The main character is completely undeveloped and entirely uncompelling. I wanted him to lose or die (and stay dead). He is irritating and manipulative using his unexplained 'abilities' (where there is no power system in place at all, just ""aND tHeN He kIlLeD hIM"") to have sex with an underaged girl whilst he himself is (extremely) underaged. It was unpleasant to read and made me so uncomfortable I put down the book for nearly a month. I was disturbed to find the author was a 30+ year old man and not a 13 year old boy.

I honestly finished the book out of pure fascination as to how anything could be so awful. I am also not remotely Christian, but at some point it stops being a social commentary on religion and becomes someone smashing ""GOD BAD"" over your head like a brick over and over again.

The grammar and spelling is another matter entirely, but as I am dyslexic I cannot talk. However, I would seriously suggest getting an editor if you ever decide to write again.

The author had so many unexplained plot points and glaring plot holes that the book is near nonsensical.

In short, this book should have never been created. It is the most abissmal piece of writing I have ever read. It was not worth the £2 I spent on it, but atleast it went to charity."

Reaper's Creek,Diabolical Duckling AKA Duck God,"May 19, 2020",1.0,"Sweet merciful Christ. I've read books that I didn't like before, but this is on another fucking level. Sure, I may rate a book one star because I personally didn't like it, but usually someone else does. I hated War Storm and Fate of the Tearling but ask around and I'm sure there's a bitch or two on Goodreads who enjoyed those two books. I seriously cannot even contemplate how ANYBODY would enjoy reading this drivel. This story is stupid as shit, boring as shit, and weird as shit. Usually I like weird shit but this creepy, over-sexualized, whiny emo crap is too goddamn much. Even if you were to pick up this book knowing nothing about the author and his child groomer tendencies, you would still think that it was written by 1) A nonce, 2) a sex freak, or 3) BOTH. There's nothing good about this book so I'll just tear it to shreds and be done with it. Much thanks to the dude who provided an audiobook, as well as the lovely Youtuber Gines who did some hilarious dramatic readings of this shite. It's the only thing that kept me sane.

1) The Senseless Story

This book's fucking plot is stupid and pointless. A whiny boy whines about shit. An alien starts bothering whiny boy and makes him do edgy things. Whiny boy freaks out. People die senselessly. Whiny boy is horny. Whiny boy has sex. Whiny boy whines. Whiny boy battles alien. The end. Seriously what the fuck is this? I think Onision shitted out this story simply to pass the time while waiting to see which teenage girl in his DMs would respond to his weiner pics first. Because this story is pointless and it has no reason to exist.

2) The Writing

I've never seen a more un-compelling, awkward, and clunky style of writing than what's in this book. This book reads like a twelve year old hastily crapped it out for a middle school creative writing project. Hell, saying that is an insult to twelve year olds. There are 12 year olds out there who can right better than pedo Onion diaper man. I truly believe the author is a sociopath, because his way of writing is the most clinical, chilling, and bland ass thing in the six dimensions. Seriously. This preteen narrator who is Onion man's self-insert is an emotionless, selfish piece of shit. People die and are hurt in front of him and he's just like ""oh, wow, a death."" He shows no fucking capacity for empathy or normal human emotions. He's an evil little shit. He's a slimy amoeba in a human flesh suit trying to act normal. But he's not normal. He's fucked. He has no emotions or care for anything other than his weiner. Which brings me to our next point.

3) SEX

Seriously wtf. This book is so goddamned horny and it has no right to be. When we meet a new female character in this crapfest the first thing the narrator describes is her tits. He fucks a girl who is way older and preying on him and acts like he's Sylvester Stallone or some shit. No, Gurg. You were preyed upon. It's not funny and it doesn't make you a player or a stud or whatever the fuck you think you are. Plenty of authors know how to write about hormonal preteens without making their books into creepy nonce fapfests. Onision is not one of them. Hell, I bet hundreds of pedophiles jerk it to this book. Gross. Get me some Jesus water.

4) THE AUTHOR IS A LITERAL PEDOPHILE

In case you were out of the loop, Onision is a literal pedophile. He has a long history of grooming young girls and being up their asses the minute they turn 18. He is a sadistic abuser who forces girls to shave their heads, berates them verbally, and forces them to help him hunt for new hot teen vag when they get too old for his tastes. He's gross and awful and is the reason why the phrase ""men are trash"" exists. Recently Chris Hansen looked into Onion Boy for his grooming of a teenage girl and him using his wife to lure in queer girls. He sends his wife to go out and present herself as single, so lesbian and bi girls hit her up. When they fly out to see the wife Onision pulls a SURPRISE PENIS! move and forces the girl to date him as well. Do you know what's another term for ""surprise penis"" moves? Rape. Yes. This fucker has screwed women under all sorts of dubious circumstances. He's a sociopathic predator who bulldozes through young girls' lives without a care for anything in the world except his peen. And you thought this was all he could do? HA. Onion Son gets fucking worse.

He neglects his children. Yes, this mistake of a human reproduced with his crummy unicorn hunter wife. He totally neglects his toddler aged children, refuses to SPEAK with them so their language development is severely stunted, and he let his daughter crawl out of a second story window so she fell and got skull fractures. He also has the IRS going for his jugular because he doesn't pay taxes. And he destroyed a protected wetland habitat for a youtube video. Seriously, can this twat get any worse? He's a real life cartoon villain at this point. He has all the ingredients for the shit sandwich. Pedophilia. Abuse. Child Neglect. Habitat Destruction. At this point all we need to do is throw in some animal cruelty as the cherry on top of the vomit sundae. Wait! I forgot! Onision also abused his dogs and gave them away to other people because he no longer gave a shit about them. He would then buy new dogs and when he got bored of them he would shuffle them off too, and buy the next, new, hot, dog model. Onision goes through his dogs like he goes through his women. He abuses them, and when they age out of being teenagers he kicks them to the curb to find the newest hot model. Rinse and repeat. He big nasty. Also, he cooked his pet turtle alive for no reason and then ate this so-called ""beloved pet."" That's what Onichan does to the things he loves. He boils them alive and eats them. I'm not even trying to be deep. That is literally what this nasty fucker does.

Final Verdict

This is a nonce book written by a nonce for nonces. I hated it and you will too. Don't give this fucker any of your hard-earned money. If you want to experience the horror look online for bootleg copies or find Gines' dramatic readings on youtube. This shit is gross and Onision is a predator. Never Forget. Duckling Out!"

That said a lot about this book bothered me. That starts by what seems to be absolutly no editing and seemingly at least one typo and/or a grammatical mistake in each sentence to the fact that the protagonist slept with a 15 year old and apparently kept that up through mental coercion into adulthood which absolutly disgusted me and only morbid fascination let me power through to the end.

I can not recommend enough to this book."
Reaper's Creek,Sonder,"April 5, 2022",1.0,"I hate the fact I undertook Krimson Rogue's challenge to read all of this man's garbage. I have yet to write my review for This Is Why I Hate You, and I recently read the available chapters for his new erotic novel... it isn't hyperbolic to say that I wanted to die reading the opening chapter.

Nevertheless, I pondered long and hard for a good way to summarize this book, and constantly fell short. Thus, I have settled on informing you that there are multiple sex scenes in this novel.

Between an 11-year-old and a 15-year-old.

There is a time skip to where Daniel-Greg is now 14, and Julia is 18. They are actively still having sex.

Let us discuss the book beyond the fucked up, legally and morally wrong romance between the two main characters. In short, it is trivial, poorly written and riddled with plot holes. I call our main man Daniel-Greg because the author literally messes up at least twice in the book, and calls him Greg when he's supposed to be Daniel. If you weren't convinced that these protagonists were self-inserts, you've got some hard proof now.

As with all of Onision's books, it features an edgy kid with severe daddy issues that waxes philosophically to the reader. Daniel, even at 11, maintains this air of arrogance and narcissism that made me want to punt this motherfucker into the . I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief and convince myself it was a kid speaking, and it only worsens as the novel goes on.

Another aspect that gets boring very quickly is Greg's hero complex that shines through in every piece of tripe he shits out. In Reaper's Creek, it's pushed to the extreme where he solves the world's issues and fights God in one of the most boring action sequences I have ever read. Ah, yes, more hatred is directed at religion in this novel too, sorry Christians.

The supporting cast of characters exist to only suck Daniel's dick. Greg literally forgets about one of Daniel's sisters that's how expendable the secondary cast are. For someone who takes note of seemingly benign details (thank you Leigh Bardugo and Sarah J. Maas, V.E. Schwab too), it was a rather jarring experience to have plot points introduced, then immediately dropped again. Similarly, characters would be introduced, then completely forgotten about. It got exhausting mentally taking notes only to realise none of it would amount to anything.

I think that was my main problem with this book besides the horrific syntax, grammatical errors and typos, you get no satisfaction from reading this novel. There's no satisfying conclusion because it's all sunshine and rainbows despite not clearing up anything, leaving the reader with only more questions that will never be answered because there is no explanation.

Another issue that really got under my skin was Onision's use of sexual and domestic abuse. Julia's father rapes women (appropriate considering what his daughter turned out like. And the author of this dumpster fire), and this is discovered by Daniel, using his god-like abilities that developed because of a stone in his head, changing the 'coding of the world' and implanting teeth in women's vaginas. I wish I was joking.

Greg then assassinates the step-dad's character from being a seemingly decent person into a drug user who beats their mother. We aren't shown this at any point during the first half of the book, when the step-dad is actually relevant. We are told this in the second half when he has been written out using divorce. Why is that a thing?

He also calls him Papa, which is strange for me, but that was probably because the only thing I could think of was Papa Emeritus from Ghost (sorry Christians). So, even with the character description given, as poor and vague as it was, I imagined the step-dad as Papa Emeritus, and I'm not going to lie, it made reading this slightly more bearable.

God, I still have so much to say, and I don't want to do what I did with Stones to Abbigale and pick this apart bit by bit because I'll be here all night. I can confirm that I hated this far more than the previous ones. My vehement hatred for Reaper's Creek could also be blamed on the fact Onision is trampling on my turf; I write fantasy, all manners of fantasy, and I greatly enjoy sci-fi. The boredom I experienced reading the other two novels could be disregarded due to the fact contemporary style novels aren't my thing. This Is Why I Hate You was unbearable due to the glamorous way Onision presented rape and violence. Arguably, Reaper's Creek does the same thing, yet on a whole other scale.

He introduces a magic system that is entirely plot convenient and develops whenever he needs it to. It's not like Daniel gets a hold of his powers and begins training them to be acute, they simply are. There's also aspects of these abilities that are randomly dropped. By the time I had finished this book, I recalled at least four occasions where I put the book down and muttered my grievances aloud. Now, admittedly, I talk to myself a lot, however it is uncommon for me to even move when I'm reading due to being immersed in the story. Frankly, this book tossed me everywhere but into the setting. While I may have been suffering a nervous breakdown, my sister, with whom I share a room, found my agony amusing. I truly suffer for my art.

In all honesty though, I don't think I could take this book cover to cover and tell you everything that's wrong with it, because this would get so long and tedious. I'll wrap it up with that this is just another of Greg's fantasies pushed to the extreme, and it is genuinely repulsive to read. I felt ill during the explicit parts, and suicidal during the rest. He grossly misuses abuse to 'add flavour' to his work, and this is not suitable for his younger audience (the only audience he has. I don't know who is going to read his new erotica apart from the youtube reviewers and little old me, because we all know the rest of his audience aren't old enough. Apparently he's writing BDSM into this new novel :) I am going to have a blast with that. Spoiler alert, Greg is not a dominant, he's an abuser)."

Okay, look. I know. I know. Why do I keep doing this? Well, guess what. This isn't a referendum on my self-destructive streak. You're here to see me shit on Greg, and that's what we're gonna do.

First things first. When you make your main character eleven, you make certain sacrifices. General knowledge, sophistication of language, etc. Greg definitely broke the language rule, but that's not the most important part. He fucking put a sex scene in. I don't even know anymore, you guys. He had a scene where a preteen finger-banged another preteen. He had a scene where a fourteen year old fucked an adult. I honestly feel like I should be on some kind of government watchlist. You just don't do that shit. And if you ABSOLUTELY MUST, you can't glamorize it. You can't. ""Lolita"" is a book about a pedophile, but it's also a book about how absolutely deranged Humbert Humber's rationalizations and thought processes are, and how disastrous the effects are for Dolores. Greg's book is about statutory rape that is depicted as completely harmless and normal. If that's something that happened to him, I'm genuinely sorry, but he burns away much of my sympathy by continuing the cycle and grooming young girls.

So the book ends with Greg-I mean Daniel-killing God. Sure. Seems a little narcissistic, but so was Milton's Satan. If you know anything about me, you know I love me some His Dark Materials, so that sort of prog-rock, overblown ending isn't immediately disqualifying. Neither are aliens. I'm a lit grad student, but I dig mass-market sci fi and fantasy paperbacks, so aliens? Sign me up. I had high hopes for this book, because it actually had an interesting title, and I thought that after shitting the bed twice, he might have hired a ghostwriter.

Nope.

This was actually worse.

I even handed this off to my mom because of how freaked it made me. She was very confused, but after I bugged her for a month, she agreed to read it.

She's a psychiatrist. She does risk assessments for prisons and some medium/high security psychiatric facilities. I will quote her directly: ""This is like...you don't even understand. I could spend my whole career dissecting different aspects of this. I'm not a fucking...Freudian, but...Jesus. This is like, Personality Disorder City. I want that thing out of my house.""

She was joking about the last part, but I ditched it anyways. I didn't want the cops finding it if they came looking for me for pirating Chernobyl. I felt like I was listening to a story told by a five year old. ""An' then I hit the aliens, an' they all 'sploded! An' then I made out with my girlfriend, an' blew up some bad guys, and-""

I know this is petty, but I HATED how Greg treaded the character of ""the special ed boy."" I would use his name, but he doesn't have one, which is a sign of the contempt and laziness with which Greg treats him. This kid is vilified as an evil alien because of his tics, and is eventually fucking brutally murdered by Greg-I-mean-Daniel with a fork. Later, with one sentence, we learn that the kid was trying to help Greg-I-mean-Daniel all along. I might be sensitive because I'm autistic, and I got nieces on the spectrum, but I thought it was fucking disgusting that Greg used a disabled child's disability to make him ""scary"" and justify killing him, without even showing enough respect to give him a name or have his death affect the Mary Sue main character in the slightest. Greg doesn't care about disabled people. He doesn't see them as human. That's made painfully obvious by that character, as well as Greg-I-mean-Daniel's brilliant idea of curing all mental illness and genetic conditions to alleviate human suffering. Don't get me wrong: treat my depression all you want, but don't you fucking touch my autism, or my niece Evadne's autism, or my cousin's Down Syndrome. It's part of what makes us all so awesome.

So. We've already accrued:
1) Child pornography
2) Eugenics / Misc. Nazi shit

We're ready for the third cardinal sin. What is it?

3) Fucking boring as hell!

There's a reason why we like superheroes. Because they're powerful, sure, and because they get shit done. But there's a reason why Superman is boring, and Batman is awesome. If your character is too overpowered, there's no tension. Were you scared when Superman faced off against a bald industrialist? I mean, maybe, because just mentioning Kryptonite is enough to get him to leave, but that's beside the point. Batman is amazing because he's just a guy in a suit, and he has to use his brain to come up with ways to beat the odds. His adventures are tense because there's so much at stake, and he's the underdog. We cheer for Rocky and Rudy for the same reason: there's more tension when the stakes are high and the odds are against the protagonist. Can omnipotent characters be interesting? Sure. See Elizabeth Comstock. But if you're as bad at writing as Greg? No way. It'll come across as wish fulfillment, and it's pathetic. It's like an incel making a fake profile on Reddit to agree with his own points. It's like Jacob Wohl making up tweets about how ""coffee shop liberals"" secretly love Trump. It's like buying a bunch of Candy-grams to send to yourself so that people will think you have friends. Of all of Greg's books, this brought me the least pleasure. There was no laughter. Only disgust, confusion, and sadness. Sadness for the trees that gave their lives. Sadness for Greg, who is trying so hard and failing so miserably. Sadness for his fans, who have read few enough books to be able to think this is good, and who will be embarrassed later. But mostly sadness for me, for killing my brain cells on this instead of reading a good book or working on my thesis, or jamming rusty screws under my fingernails, or any number of activities more rewarding and enjoyable than reading anything written by Greg."

Is the main character Daniel is just so boring, even after he gets his op powers. Yeah that's one thing you can say about a boy where he curb-stomps a bunch of aliens, Death, and God (respectively) with little effort or tension and it is so very boring. Period. Oh and there are other characters but they are so one note I can’t remember one from another they are that superfluous and unmemorable.

It's reads just that terribly. I know this is me a bit charitable but it might (and that an incredibly big “might”) be an okay first-draft, in need of editing by a mask waring slasher villain with a chain-saw. I know Greggy-Poo likes to say that he does not need an editor. Uh, yeah Greg you do, badly! And apparently your spouse shouldn’t be editing too. You both suck at editing! Hire a professional!

Oh didn’t buy the the book I listened to the Audiobook for free. It isn’t worth any money at all. Do not buy!

And Greggy-Poo I saw the video that compared your self with Steven King. Here’s the difference, Onion. Steven King is actually a damn good writer, even at his lowest can still write circles around someone as incompetent as you! Take a writing class before you try writing a story again.

And don't get me started on the glorification of a statutory rape. I wasted 3 hours and 36 minutes listening to a poor Youtuber narrate it.

Har du noen gang lurt på hva som hadde skjedd om du blandet en dinosaur og et menneske? Det var et av de viktige temaene denne boken tar opp, men uten at svaret på NOEN SOM HELST MÅTE har noe å si.

Dette er den første boken jeg har lest hvor protagonisten banker opp bøllen uten at bøllen har gjort annet enn å se litt surt på helten vår.

Også heltens første møte med sine nye krefter var noe kreativ. Protaganistens første sukesshistorie var når han klarte å disse mye høyere enn alle de andre barnene - åpenbart fordi han tenkte på at den alkoholiserte onkelen hans prøvde å tvinge ham til å drikke (duh).

Jeg fikk også oppleve drapet på gud, men her var det ikke vi, men kun en person som drepte ham (sorry nietzsche).

Det er rett og slett litt vanskelig å si om denne boken er skrevet seriøst eller ikke, den var rett og slett så sinnsykt dårlig skrevet. Jeg tror til og med at min Harry Potter fanfiction fra 4. klasse som er skrevet fra Voldemorts perspektiv i tiden før han blir gjennfødt var bedre, og det er IKKE fin lesning.

I have so many questions about all of the inconsistencies in this book. First, you will notice throughout the book that Greg has called his lead protagonist Daniel by the name ""Greg"" multiple times. He also has an older sister who never speaks or interacts with the family. He doesn't speak of her at all beside today she exists. He has countless misspellings and he cannot grasp grammar. I also felt immensely uncomfortable with the 18 year old girl having sex with a 14 year old boy and the...graphic nature of it. Apparently Gre-I mean-DANIEL has graduated from a sex god to an...actual God? I am NOT joking. He made this character who represents him...more powerful than God who he refers to as ""The Body"".

Reaper's Creek,Bailey Crawly,"November 30, 2019",1.0,"This book is a good example of narcissism.
Firstly, it DESPERATELY needs an editor. This book is riddled with typos, grammatical errors, paragraphing problems and everything else you can think of, to the point of making this book difficult (nearing impossible) to read from start to finish.
Too much of Greg’s personal narrative and beliefs come forward in this book. It just sounds like a series of lectures from Greg (in some cases, the main character is CALLED Greg, almost as though he used his own name in the first draft and, when he went to change it, he missed a few instances). The entire purpose of picking up a work of fiction is to escape the real world, and this is just a direct extension of Greg as a person, which is bitterly unappealing. Perhaps if he had written an autobiography it would still be unbearably horrible in the writing department, but it would be a little more genuine.
The book goes all over the place in such a way that it’s distracting. It’s fine to write a book flying by the seat of your pants, but the story needs to be rooted somewhat in logic. The book wasn’t set up as a fantasy novel that would allow a writer to get away with the unrealistic “plot twists” in this book; it’s set up as a book partially about Greg’s personal life. Therefore it’s somewhat rooted in reality, a rule that this book disregards fairly early on.
It’s clearly a Young Adult book, distributed primarily on his Patreon which was supposed to be 18+.
Honestly, as a young adult book, this isn’t good. We don’t go into a young adult novel expecting ground-breaking worldbuilding and carefully constructed prose, but at the same time this is a new low for young adult fiction. It’s just a mess.
Everybody has a natural gift; something they’re good at and can use to help improve the world around them. This is a prime example of why you shouldn’t force something creatively if it doesn’t fall under one of your gifts. As a small-run publication for his close friends and family as a way to prove to himself that he could write a book (or 3), it’s good enough, but this is not publishable material. It’s certainly not something I would ever want to read again, and that’s something I very rarely ever say.
I know he’s writing another book as we speak. And I’m just praying I don’t get possession of it, because from the little bit that I’ve seen, it’s a mess. Greg, you just aren’t gifted as a writer, accept that and move on."

THE SECRET MESSAGES FROM GOD

I read this, back then, in 1999, and I found out that there are several sequel books of this, but I haven't read those (so far), but I can assure you that, at least, this first book, is totally amazing to read.

The ""Bible Code"" idea is a theory that God put secret messages in the used words in the Bible, in its original Hebrew format, specially on the Pentateuch, the first 5 books of the Old Testament and it's understood that they were written by the very hand of God, so from all the books in the Bible, those are the most likely books to be applied to this theory.

Also, more than ""secret messages"", ths idea is that the Pentateuch is actually like the ""program"" used by God to do the whole creation, all that was, all that is, all that will be, so...

...using modern computers, it has been transcribed the Pentateuch in a spherical way, making interconections with all the words of those 5 books, that it would be impossible to accomplish in any other way to make it, and you can ""ask questions"" to the Pentateuch and you get ""answers""...

...and technically you can ask not only about past events, but also the future...

...of course, verify or more like it, find a meaning, when it's about something that already happened, it's kinda ""easy""...

...but when you tried to ask something about the future, well, without a context, it's not so easy to understand the ""answer""...

I found this reading quite astonishing and overwhelming, obviously I can't say if it's true beyond any doubt, but honestly, what I read about here, and the ""answers"" that they were obtained from the test done to the ""Bible Code"", certainly gave me a lot to think and feeling that...

...indeed the hand of God is there."
The Bible Code,bup,"March 5, 2010",1.0,"A lot of the dazzle of this book is gone once you realize that, if you can read Hebrew, the horizontal text is just plain text. So he's just playing find-a-word vertically (without vowels, so, for instance, DALLAS would be DLS), and then looks for words 'crossing' it - of course words cross it! It's plain text!

Look! 'Die' crosses 'Dallas'! That 'proves' my text magically knew about the Kennedy assasination!

He does the same thing - he's very impressed that he found ""Kennedy"" crossing ""president."" What he found was ""KND"" crossing the Hebrew word for ""chieftain"" which he loosely translated as ""president."" And again, of course ""chieftain"" is in the text - it's plain text.

Add in to that that he rearranges these things constantly (look at every 20th letter. Nothing? Look at every 21st letter. Nothing? Look at every 22nd letter. .) Then he goes even farther than that, accepting diagonal words (and words at various slopes).

It's garbage, garbage, garbage, and has never predicted anything before the fact (which is, in fairness, included in the definition of predict)."
The Bible Code,Lee Harmon,"April 6, 2011",1.0,"You knew I’d get to this book eventually, right? Well, I’m here to tell you it’s absolutely brilliant. Drosnin is my idol. With a savvy grasp of human nature, a little computer programming, and a mathematician’s insight into probabilities, he put together a best seller.

The book’s premise is that the Bible contains a secret code, and that he has cracked the code to reveal its hidden messages. Simply start at any letter in the Bible, skip ahead a fixed number of letters to the next, and continue until it spells out … well, whatever you like. Start with the first T in Genesis, skip 49 letters to an O, skip 49 more to an R, 49 more to H. Lo and behold, you’ve spelled TORH, the Hebrew word for the first five books of the Bible. Miraculous, isn’t it?

No, it’s neither miraculous nor unexpected. As Keith Devlin demonstrated about a year after The Bible Code hit the bookstores, the word TORH appears 56,768 more times in the software, searching just the book of Genesis alone. TORH appeared in an issue of the Wall Street Journal 15,000 times. But might there be more impressive words than TORH? Yes, several! The first encoded phrase the book mentions is “Yitzhak Rabin,” which he uncovers in Deuteronomy. Drosnin carefully lays out his analysis in matrix form so that it looks like a word find puzzle, and crossing Yitzhak Rabin is the phrase “Assassin that will assassinate.” Need more evidence? The phrase “Rabin assassination” crosses “Tel Aviv” in the book of Exodus. Yep, that’s where Amir assassinated Rabin. Oh, the name “Amir” appears in the book of Numbers.

A code of equidistant letters buried within the Bible is not a new idea. See Wikipedia for a full discussion. But with a little computer programming, Drosnin pushes it to the limit. He uncovers prophecies about Watergate, Hitler, Shakespeare’s writings, Edison’s inventions, the holocaust, Roosevelt, Kennedy, communism, Armageddon, and, amazingly, the promise of a future book named “Bible Code.”

It all sounds convincing, until a little experimentation verifies the same probabilistic expectations in other works of literature. Moby Dick revealed much of the same prophecies and many more. So, mathematicians turned back to the Bible to see what else they could learn by the using the software. Several more startling prophecies surfaced: “Code is bunk.” “Drosnin Fraud.” “Darwin was right.” Sigh.

Please don’t read the book, but do gain inspiration from the genius of Drosnin. Millions of dollars are waiting for the next great sham."

At the beginning I was intrigued by the idea that everything was somehow coded in the bible, that everything that happened and what is going to happen was already written 3.000 years ago.

The author is one of many who claim that there is a hidden code in the Bible that predicts all the major events of the future. The only redeeming quality is that it has dozens of pages that are mostly or entirely taken up with examples of this code, like a crossword puzzle. So there's that much less to read. It's also super repetitive, and some of the ""prophecies"" seem super vague.

The Bible Code,Amy,"September 14, 2009",3.0,"I bought this book awhile ago, and have the follow-up somewhere on a bookshelf as well. What I've found interesting about this book - and the topic in general - is that it sounds logical and almost believable. That is, until you see the same folks on television, on History Channel or NatGeo, etc., and they seem like utter quacks. Much like saving history from disaster is oftentimes 20/20 when seen through the review mirror, books of this ilk frequently show that they would've been able to 'predict' or 'prevent' catastrophe if only they had known what to look for within the scriptures. I would imagine our own intelligence services could claim the same, and indeed they have, when history has challenged what we knew and when.

The thing about these books - whether we want to believe biblical predictions or not - is that they challenge the limits of our imagination and our faith, and not every book that ever hits bookstores can claim that feat."

If it's the former the code would mean nothing more than the happenstance. if it is the latter then understanding the text itself would be quite enough.

Since the text of the Bible in the original is in 3 laguages (Old Test. in what we call Hebrew, New Test. In Aromaic and Greek) which manuscripts are the ones we should use for counting the code etc.

The Bible Code,C.A. Gray,"September 27, 2021",4.0,"Very interesting concepts. Drosnin did not discover the Bible Codes he describes here; he's a reporter (and an atheist one at that) who stumbled upon the discovery via a computer program discovered by a Jewish rabbi. He then cross-referenced it with numerous mathematicians who could not disprove it. (Incidentally, Isaac Newton was convinced such a code existed, and spent more of his time searching for it than he did on any of his scientific theories. But as Drosnin points out, perhaps it was time-locked; Newton could not have found it because computers had yet to be invented.) Through the code, which used some of the same code-breaking techniques employed during WWII (and probably far beyond) such as very complex skip sequences and such, he found prophecies of major world events which did indeed occur. Still he was skeptical, until he encountered the prediction of the then-Israeli prime minister's assassination. He happened to have a connection to the PM (Rabin), and warned him of the potential danger. Rabin ignored the warning, and he was assassinated right on schedule. After the fact, Drosnin saw that the name of Rabin's assassin was in the code too--they just hadn't known to look for it beforehand.

This made a believer (in the code, not in God, strangely enough) out of Drosnin, but it sent him into the tailspin question later posed by the Oracle to Neo in the Matrix: ""What's really going to bake your noodle is, would you still have broken it (the vase) if I hadn't said anything?"" In other words, now that we know about potential dangers, can we do anything to change it? Thus enters physics concepts of determinism vs quantum physics. As Drosnin and those who knew the code and had the program did more and more searches, they encountered a number of predictions that had yet to occur. Some were very specific, and did not happen... but those predictions also included phrases near them like, ""delayed"" or ""will you change it?"" or multiple potential years for said event to come about. Most notably, he discovered years of threatened nuclear war in the Middle East which might lead to Armageddon -- but those years were 1996, 2000, and 2006. Were there other potential years as well? Was crisis effectively averted by choices made by those in power (as a result of knowledge about the code or otherwise)? I was most struck by one such prediction from 1996, when Israel's Netanyahu was to go and visit a neighboring world leader on Tisha B'Av, or the 9th day of the Hebrew month of Av. (Incidentally this date twice marked the destruction of the Jewish temple: once by the Babylonians in 423 BC, and once by the Romans in 70 AD. Traditionally it's also the date that the 12 spies returned from the Promised Land with an evil report, leading to 40 more years of wandering in the wilderness.) The date is considered cursed by the Jews, and they observe it with fasting and prayer -- so it seemed strange to me that Netanyahu would have chosen an important meeting on that date. According to the code, there was a threat that Netanyahu would be assassinated that day, an event which would lead directly to nuclear conflict and the End of Days. But, by happenstance, the other world leader was ill, Netanyahu delayed his trip 10 days, and later those with access to the program saw the word ""delayed"" across the date of the visit. Nothing happened, of course. Could such a small occurrence have changed world events? As Drosnin pointed out, WWI began with an assassination, which almost didn't occur--Archduke Ferdinand's driver turned down the wrong street, they encountered their assassin who had missed his opportunity earlier that day and was otherwise on the point of giving up, and the rest is history.

I'm intrigued by the concept, bottom line. I hold the Bible as the inerrant word of God, and believe every word is there for a reason. There are no extraneous details. But if that goes for the text as written, could it also go for the structure of the text, too? If it did, though, what would be the reason for it--unless it were possible for those of us with access to its future warnings (after the invention of the computer, and the discovery of the code) to use that information to our advantage?"
The Bible Code,M.M. Hudson,"March 22, 2019",1.0,"It is not too often that I come across a book that I really don't care for. This happens to be one of those books. I got through chapter 7 and quit reading. Frankly it is just too much. I had high hope for this book based on the fact the author is coming from a journalistic perspective and not one from religion (as he claims to be atheist). Here is why I could not continue.

First of all, I hate the repetitiveness of the author. It seemed to me he repeated himself so much that he was trying to convince even himself of what he is trying to prove.

Secondly, It seems that if it was a truly workable ""code"" that predictions would be seen/available before events happen. Everything that I have read with one exception has been after the fact.What use is a predictive code if you cannot prevent things from happening? Even if the ""code"" is true, truthfully what good is it because most people are not going to base their life on what it says.

Finally, and frankly, unless you know Hebrew, the code is useless for the common person, the whole code is being interpreted (?) by people who know Hebrew and taken for their word.The author said that you cannot find the ""code"" in any other language. Honestly, the Hebrew they say are the ""code"" could be anything. I speak English and a bit of Spanish. How am I to know?

Bottom line, I think this book (and apparently the next two books the author wrote) are a bunch of hooey. This gets a one star from me.

It is easy to have doubts in this world-especially if a person has no real knowledge of G-d's plan or of His blueprint for humanity.

So remembering that the odds of these codes appearing on the exact parsha in the Torah to which the words relate- on even one single page- are astronomical enough to be considered ""impossible"" by human standards brings enormous comfort during times when faith is tested.

Only a person who is determined to scoff at G-d so he or she can continue to engage in idol worship or behave as they wish would ""debunk"" these discoveries. The world renowned code-cracker Elyahu Rips who discovered the codes was an atheist, but became deeply religious after these discoveries."
The Bible Code,Sammy Tiranno,"September 22, 2018",2.0,"Grabbed this at a book sale. It’s one of those books that you’ve seen or heard about but never got around to reading. I was surprised to find that it’s already 20 years old.

The claim is that major historical events, both past and future, have been encoded within the Hebrew Bible. The author discovers/demonstrates this through equidistant letter sequences that reveal related words in both the plain text and hidden text, arranged in proximity to each other horizontally, vertically, and/or diagonally. The appendix contains the scientific article that was published to explain the mathematics behind the code.

At first glance, the idea may be intriguing, but after learning a little bit more about the supposed coding, and how related words/names/dates are being drawn from the text, I’m not confident that there’s some intentional meaning, and it appears much less sensational."

It's a fictionalized and highly exaggerated version of her rise to fame, but it's a great summer read. Pamela, along with her ghost writer, did an excellent job with the book as it's full of everything a summer book should have: love, romance, drama, action, suspense, money and fame. This is not the next great American novel, and it knows that; it doesn't take itself seriously and therefore no one else should. If you like Pamela Anderson, and want a fun summer read, pick this.

I knew from the first chapter that it was going to be awful, but I stuck it out until the end anyways. I'm not sure why. When it comes to recommending this book, I recommend you stay as far away from it as possible."
Star,Gretchen,"August 13, 2007",2.0,"I read this book primarily because my cousin was the ghost writer. Given this knowledge, some of the more graphic sex scenes gave me pause,(especially an orgy near the end) if only because I pictured my elderly great-aunt reading them. That being said, it was an amusing tale of a young girl who comes to the Hollywood scene riding on her good looks. At times it is hard to believe how naive this character is, especially the scene when she flies to LA and is completely ignorant of airport policies. It becomes obvious that this is an autobiographical tale when Pam describes the ingenue's role on a television series about the lifegaurds called Lifeguards, Inc. While this book is certainly not at the top of any of my lists, nor did it cause me to rethink the problems of the world..I was amused on my way to and from work, and I suppose that is all that matters."
Star,Madelyn Rose,"June 7, 2016",1.0,"Okay, what even is this book? It was just awful! The only reason I picked this up was because I wanted to try reading one of the ""worst rated books on Goodreads"", and clearly this book was on the list for a reason.

I thought that this would be a light read and just be a quick and simple read. Just a book without deep meaning... However, this book was terribly written with such a ridiculous plot. This book was supposed to vaguely resemble Pamela Anderson's life. But, this book was awful. Just awful. I cannot even express how much I hated this book.

Even if I were to enjoy this book, this book was very hard to get in to. The story line was just so all over the place. Also, in this book the phrases are too repetitive. The ""transition"" words are too repetitive.

This book was just a bit odd, and if someone WANTED to read this book, it is not for a younger reader. There were just some scenes that were a bit iffy. The book was basically about young Pam going to Hollywood, relying on her looks.

All in all, terrible book, wouldn't recommend. Happy Reading!

that's what i learned to this book.
when me and my friend bought this book, i thought it was a teenage adult book... but were wrong.. this book is not for our age by that time, and it's not for teenagers, its for adults!
for the first time, in my life, this book made me see things that is way beyond my knowing. this is the book who introduce me in such things.. (well, for those who read it, you know what i'm talking about)
well, i don't know any good things that i've read inside this book.
i just learned some things about sex. that's all."

I only gave this enjoyable read one star because Pamela's boobs are bigger than mine, she's rich and I'm not and she was helped by a ghost. I hate that shit. No ghosts help me write MY books! Boo fucking hoo. Also. She was chased down and caught by Tommy Lee. I hear he's an idiot and I believe it but I've never been chased down and caught by a big dick rock star before.

This was a quick, easy, typical chick lit summer read. Pamela Anderson gets her story across under the masked label of ""fiction"", though anyone who is a fan of hers can pick out the comparisons.(Fictional busty blonde Star Leigh gets a job as tool girl on ""Hammer Time""). It's not a complete waste of time, but it's clear that she should stick to acting/modeling/defending animals. It's an interesting read, but overall I found it to be completely average.

Fans of Gossip Girl and girly books of that sort might enjoy this far more than I did."

And the plot is so unbelievable, this should be catagorized as a ""fantasy"" novel...oh, and there's a spelling error on page 71!! ""THERE going to fly me out to Los Angeles..."" What?! Also, what is with every character star meets shortening their name?! So repetitive & stupid!"
Star,Racheal,"September 16, 2007",1.0,"This is pretty much the type of book you'd expect Pam Anderson to write. Except, she didn't write it. She had someone else ghost-write it.

Star,Sher,"October 7, 2013",1.0,"I like Pamela Anderson and I wanted to like this book; however, its faults weigh heavily on the reader. Thoughts appear sporadically from random characters throughout the story, careening the point of view off course. The lazy writing is especially noticed when the same key phrasing is used to end or gloss over scenes just when they have the potential to get interesting. The final third of the novel is worse than the rest, as even the redeeming sparkle in the main character's voice falls flat. The book begins to lack so much cohesion, it feels as though there are five writers instead of two. On page 270, they can't even keep the names ""Star"" and ""Stan"" straight. The ending neither feels like a conclusion, nor a segue to a sequel. It just stops rambling, which is at least something, I suppose. Again, I like Pamela. I think she's funny and genuine. I wish she'd written an autobiography instead of this mess."
Star,Sara Thompson,"April 23, 2008",3.0,"This is a horribly bad yet fun story of Pam's life turned into fiction. The obvious use of ""big words"" screamed to me, ""I am too smart!"" All said and done though, I really enjoyed the story. It was a guilty read just like any Harlequin which this novel really is. If I didn't know this was Pam's life I would have just assumed that Fabio would be on the cover. Since it is based on truth though, I wonder if she really did sleep with so many people to get where she is! Although the lead, Star, is a little skanky she's extremely likable and you find yourself relating to her just like any friend whose behavior you don't approve of. This was a great break from all the seriously depressing books I have been in contact with. It's a great beach or pool-side read. I will guiltily be picking up Starstruck, the sequel, soon :o)"
Star,Henri Moreaux,"January 29, 2013",2.0,"It's hard to work out exactly what the point of this book was. It's loosely based around Ms Anderson's life, but why not just have the ghost writer write her bio? If the reason is because it lacked pizazz then why not write a fiction novel that is total fiction? Instead we have a mix of the two which sort of works, but naturally you find yourself comparing names in the book to real people which takes away from the story, such as it is.

This book sat on my shelf for over 5 years as I'd heard it was really terrible and not worth the effort, however as writing goes I would say it's not badly written, it is just the contents of the story itself that is resoundingly average."

Star,chynna,"July 30, 2008",2.0,"When I started reading the first page, it was very promising. Then BAM, the softcore Lesbian sex scene at the beach. There were a number of sex scenes and three of them freaked me out. It really wasn't tooo bad of a book. The main character, Star is one of those people who you can't help but like. If the story had less sex, more content and maybe a different story line (haha) it could have been good chick-lit."
Star,Alannah,"February 6, 2008",2.0,"This was a bargain book that I paid $5 or something for, and I thought it'd be good, light, trashy reading. It was definitely light and trashy but good... well, maybe. I am not sure how I could be disappointed by a book I had such low expectations for in the first place, but it was pretty bad! The dialogue was especially horrible--it was written at about a 2nd grade level (except with sex scenes). I'm not sure that there's much else to say about it, but I got what I paid for."
Star,Brandi Celestino,"February 22, 2009",3.0,"What I realized with this book is that Pam actually wrote this novel. This is not an autobiography. Surprisingly, she didn't do such a bad job. What she did was write the book with fictional characters that mimic her life. So you can tell it is her story of how she got through the business through somebody else. Not my fave autobiography but still okay. Also doesn't hold a candle to the Jenna Jameson autobio."
Star,Kristina Thornton,"December 23, 2008",3.0,"This is nothing more than a thinly disguised autobiography of Pamela Anderson's life. But it is a fun read. She is not shy about herself, her past, her faults, her various sexual conquests, etc. And she has a good sense of humor, much of it aimed at herself. There are several times during the book where she makes fun of herself and her very small town upbringing (her first plane trip is a hoot!). Worth the time to read, very fun!"
Star,Chrissy,"February 15, 2011",1.0,"If you ever wondered what would happen if Pamela Anderson wrote a book, lemme tell you... it really is THAT bad. This thinly veiled excuse for an autobiography is just painful.

No, not only is it ridiculous, STAR just isn't fun either."
Star,Amy,"January 31, 2008",3.0,"This wasn't bad, sometimes it cracked me up. I wanted a little more insight into Pamela's life so I wish it were an autobiography instead of fiction. Obviously, it was based on her life but to what extent I'll never know. Overall, it was a light book to read and pretty fun with some memorable scenes. She can make a sex scene both sexy & funny at the same time."
Star,Amy,"September 5, 2008",1.0,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Poorly written, not interesting at all. I tried reading it and I really tried finishing it but only got about half way through. I thought I would like it and end up loving Pam but OMG it sucks. I just don't care what a trashy skank Pam is. It makes me think less of her now because you know Star is based on Pam. It's not even good chic lit. Totally not worth reading."
Star,Angela,"June 18, 2010",3.0,"It is a novel based on Pam Anderson's life. It was also (supposedly) written by her. Is this the Great American Novel? Absolutely not! But we all know that going in. So as long as you aren't looking for a great work of literature, it is a fun read. Some slutty scenes--so if you really don't like sex scenes in books, stay away."
Star,Niki,"July 1, 2012",2.0,Terribly written and terribly entertaining (if you like stories about beautiful people and their sordid sex lives). This is Pamela Anderson's thinly veiled life story of the billions of people she had sex with - names changed to protect the innocent. (Though it wasn't hard to guess who was was who... Allen Timmesh? Really?) It would have been better as a movie.
Star,Janna,"July 1, 2014",1.0,"One of the few books I picked up and never got to the end of. Was borrowing it from my cousin and even at 15 I knew it was terrible.

Star,Kellie,"October 29, 2007",1.0,"I read this one a while ago, and laughed hysterically throughout, not because it was a funny book, but because it was so very bad. I think Pam Anderson is alright as a model, maybe an actress, but she is a terrible author, horrible in fact."
Star,Amy Adams,"January 19, 2008",4.0,"Pretty good for a celebrity-trash novel. Pamela Anderson says she's writing about a fictional character, but it seems more like a (barely) fictionalized account of her own life. It is kind of a fun peek inside the life of a starlet."
Star,Flora,"February 22, 2008",1.0,"This is as close to a Pamela Anderson memoir as we're likely to get, and it's mind-numbingly boring. I didn't expect ""Anna Karenina,"" but a little ""Happy Hooker"" and a little less ""Hollywood Wives"" would have gone a long way."

Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,Sarah,"February 24, 2014",4.0,"Well, who hasn't wanted to beat Mr. Collins with a riding crop?"
Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,Kristina,"May 24, 2019",2.0,"Once again, misguided curiosity has taken me to a mediocre book. Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen by Arielle Eckstut and Dennis Ashton wants to be funny (or maybe even scandalous?) but is not. It fails completely in execution. My only genuine snort of amusement came at the very end in “Persuasion: the Prequel.” A character is thinking how great his large, full-length mirrors will look in his library once he’s removed all the books. That’s rather amusing. As for all the other “lost” sex scenes, mostly I rolled my eyes at the groan-worthy (and obvious) double entendres. The sex scenes are not sexy or funny; the puns and juvenile humor are so tasteless and idiotic as to make the reader feel embarrassed for the authors. Ironically, these supposed lurid sex scenes are mostly innuendo and vague descriptions. I’ve read Judy Blume young adult novels that were more explicit (and better written).

The premise of is that two American tourists retracing the steps of Jane Austen just happen to find lost scenes from Jane Austen’s novels. They are sex scenes that Austen had to excise from her novels in order to publish them. This gag is carried throughout with an introduction by a fake Jane Austen scholar and scholarly footnotes to articles that (probably) don’t exist. Each sex scene is presented within the context of its surrounding story. Eckstut and Ashton often quote preceding text from the novel (the actual novel) in italics, then insert the discovered sex scene where fictitious Austen scholars decided it was cut. Sometimes this works, but often it does not.

The premise of this joke does not work. These sex scenes (if they truly existed) would have changed the course of the novels and how the characters behaved towards each other. If Austen had written a lesbian threesome between Jane Bennet, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley (), the rest of the novel would have been entirely different. Scenes such as these could not be simply cut from the novel. Also, the set-up for the sex scene is usually wrong. The authors/fake editors/Austen scholars (?) introduce the scenes by saying, well, scholars have always wondered about this or that event in the novel because it’s never explained—oh, but now that we have these scenes, the confusion is gone. This scholarly confusion is completely fictitious and the characters’ actions are fully explained by the events of the story. No fake sex scenes are required. I know I’m being pedantic about this, but c’mon. If you’re going to do a (fake) scholarly interpretation of the novels, do it better than this. I’m not a scholar, but I’ve read most of these novels a few times and I cried foul on the reasoning immediately. Also, the sex scenes often do not match Austen’s voice and (even more clumsily) tell the story from a POV not seen again in the novel, such as the excised scene from . It’s told from Jane’s POV, however the rest of the novel is never from her POV. So Austen did that just to write a ridiculous sex scene?

I wouldn’t be surprised if the authors made a list of various sex acts then matched them to characters from each book, checking them off as they wrote. There’s lesbian threesome sex, masturbation, fantasy, incest, spanking, sex toys, cross-dressing, more serious BDSM, and “buggery” (gay sex). All of the scenes are ridiculous and void of humor. I found the implied bestiality between Edward and his horse () the most tasteless. This scene, which is actually an Elinor and Marianne Dashwood sister chat about their sexual experiences, is also the most inane. The sisters’ dialogue resembles two dipshit teenagers from a modern YA novel (“Did you touch ? Yes, I touched !) and is eye-rolling stupid. The authors went to great lengths to keep finding objects or words that imply “penis”: swords, billiard cues, etc. There’s also suggestive phrases: a male character’s “hard nature,” and “premature ecstasy.” More eye-rolling. The incest scene between Henry and Mary Crawford of is just…yuck. The two characters (who are horrible people) are made even worse by mocking Fanny and Edmund for being overly straitlaced and religious. This pissed me off for some reason because the accusations are false and this nastiness is clumsy and indicative of the juvenile sense of humor that the authors of this book possess.

I know some reviewers found the spanking scene between Charlotte and Mr. Collins to be funny, but I didn’t. It’s too over the top stupid for me. It requires (as do all the scenes) the characters to behave in ways that are outside of their personalities. It’s not that you cannot create sex scenes for all of these people (well, the married ones), it’s just the scenes need to correspond with their personalities. Realistically, would Jane Austen have any clue about this kind of sexual variety? You’re talking about a woman who never married, whose father was a reverend. She didn’t even move about in the kind of society that would have known about or engaged in these kinds of activities. Another reason the premise of doesn’t work for: Austen didn’t have the experience to have the imagination to create these scenes. And if you think, well, no one did at that time—au contraire! I have before me a book called . It is a collection of Victorian England stories published in an underground magazine of erotica. A retired professor who collected Victorian erotica donated his whole collection to the university library I was employed at and I, out of curiosity, snapped up this book. It’s explicit and devoid of any kind of romance or other adventures. Just lots of vivid descriptions of throbbing cocks and all that. That’s not really my thing so I’m going to donate it to my local library, but it really puts the fictitious lost Jane Austen sex scenes to shame. They’re children’s bedtime stories compared with this stuff.

I don’t recommend . The premise is shaky and doesn’t hold up and worst of all, it’s just not funny. The authors could have done this better by writing an entirely original novel in the style of Austen and hailing it as a lost Jane Austen novel—but radically different in that it includes sex scenes. I don’t think that would have successful either based on their inability to write humor, but at least they wouldn’t have put their grimy paws all over beloved Austen classics."
Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,Lauren,"July 11, 2010",1.0,"A friend loaned this to me because he thought it was hilarious. I was skeptical, but decided to give it a read. I made it through about a third of the book before I put it down, and I have no intention of picking it up again.

There are so many things that are very terribly wrong with this book. First, although the authors claim that they're familiar with Austen's voice and have preserved it perfectly, I beg to disagree. It's off, so very off, and painfully obvious. It reads more like fan fic written by a moderately skilled teenager. Second, although I have no problem with admitting that people in the Regency era were sexual beings, and even (gasp) engaged in such scandalous behavior as premarital sex and extramarital affairs, the situations envisioned by Eckstut and Ashton are so very modern and contrived that they don't fit the characters at all. Third, the book (perhaps jokingly) claims that these scenes fill in some missing holes in the novels, but if anything, they would have made the stories seem even more confusing.

I understand this is supposed to be a parody, but it's not very well done. It's just bizarre."

Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,Girl with her Head in a Book,"August 21, 2019",2.0,"For my full review: https://girlwithherheadinabook.co.uk/...

For me, the strangest thing about this book is that it was published in 2003. Discovering it by accident in a charity shop, I assumed that it was part of the post-Fifty Shades bonanza for stuffing sex scenes into classic fiction. But then I remembered that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Lack of overt passion in Austen's novels has been a sticking point since her books first hit the shelves. Even Charlotte Brontë found Austen's writing hard to connect with on these grounds. So instead, remedies are sought and the main solution is fan fiction. Strange to say, but this is actually not the first piece of Austen-inspired erotica that I have ever read however it is by far the silliest.

The premise is that two Austen scholars were staying at an English estate in 1999 and they uncovered a cache of letters by Austen which had been hidden after her death by her sister Cassandra. The letters detail Austen's battles with her publisher who express their horror at the scandalous content of her novels and demand that the offending scenes be cut out. She was forced to comply but with Pride and Promiscuity, we are finally reading her books as she really wanted them to be read. Ahem.

What makes me laugh about the other reviews is how so many of them seem to have completely missed the joke. 'Some' of the scenarios weren't realistic, bleated one. Another complained that Eckstut hadn't 'quite' captured Austen's voice. Yes, the scenes are ludicrous and far-fetched. Of course they are. This is a book about sex scenes in Jane Austen. Get a grip! Jane Bennet's illness at Netherfield is revealed as being due to the trauma at having to fend off the lesbian advances of both of Mr Bingley's sisters. Elinor and Marianne Dashwood discuss their sexual exploits which include Elinor pleasuring both Edward Ferrars and his horse. Henry and Mary Crawford's relationship appears to have shades of the Lannisters about it. This book is a pastiche. We are not being asked to take it seriously. To be frank, I found the earnest efforts within Scenes Jane Austen Never Wrote infinitely more irksomene since their authors clearly believed them to be credible.

Radio 4's sitcom Old Harry's Game has a recurring joke where Jane Austen is revealed to be a foul-mouthed Cockney who is quick with her fists. I could snigger at Pride and Promiscuity in a similar vein. It's not actually particularly explicit. If you want tasteful imaginings of intimacy between the new Mr and Mrs Darcy, I think you'd be better with Scenes Jane Austen Never Wrote. Here they just bonk on the grass while making awkward chit-chat. But even that is a clear play on the sexual tension which is so obvious when they have their unexpected encounter at Pemberley. Yes, it's sending up the novel rather than something to be taken seriously, but that doesn't mean that Eckstut hasn't picked up on something.

There are definite moments which raised a laugh. I had to admire how Eckstut had pieced together so many of the most memorable phrases from Austen's personal correspondence and jigsawed it together to produce letters explaining the book's existence. The imagined scene where Charlotte Collins (nee Lucas) dresses up as Lady Catherine in dominatrix mode and orders her husband around was probably the most successful of the novel. We all knew that there was something very weird in Mr Collins' servility towards his beloved patroness. The idea of Emma pleasuring herself out of sheer delight at her own wonderfulness also has a ring of truth. The imagined scene of Mr Palmer utterly ignoring his wife's attempts to dream up fantasy scenarios made me giggle given that a university lecturer once commented in class that it was a real mystery how the two of them ever conceived a child. I also loved the idea that The Watsons had had to be abandoned entirely because it was just pure filth. However. These were isolated moments among a lot of other scenes which were less successful. Ultimately it was not as entertaining a read as I might have hoped.

Despite presenting us with this anarchic re-imagining of the sex lives of Austen's characters, Eckstut's writing never feels particularly creative. ITV's Lost in Austen introduced a version of Wickham who was a true gentleman and who had taken the blame for Georgiana Darcy's attempt to seduce him to avoid her getting into trouble with her brother. We thought we knew the story, they flipped it on its head - it was hilarious. There are no equivalent moments here. Eckstut has tried to be outlandish here but aside from the Collins episode, her inventions fail to really bite into the text. More pertinently, in her desire to shock, she missed out some of the more obvious pairings. What kind of a relationship were Edward Ferrars and Lucy Steele having? How did Lucy end up switching brothers? Then there's Willoughby who was an accomplished and shameless seducer. Did Isabella Thorpe actually have sex with Frederick Tilney? Weirdest of them all, how did Henry Crawford end up sleeping with Maria Bertram when he was supposedly in love with Fanny Price? What Eckstut - and indeed many Austen readers - seem to have missed is that there are no 'lost sex scenes'. The sex in Austen has always been there. You just have to pay attention.

I have probably mentioned before about when I first read His Dark Materials at the age of fourteen, how I was startled to hear two of my male friends discussing the sex scene between Will and Lyra. I was certain that no such thing existed. When I reread the book a few years ago, I spotted it straight away. So it is with Jane Austen. In John Mullan's spectacular What Matters in Jane Austen, he analyses the presence of sex in the novels and the important role of sexual desire across Austen's works. Helena Kelly's The Secret Radical takes the topic further, theorising that a key passage in Northanger Abbey represents masturbation, that Harriet Smith in Emma is Miss Bates' illegitimate child and that Edward Ferrars may be sexually deviant. She also traces out some of the disturbing implications around the sad history of Colonel Brandon's childhood love Eliza. Through her anti-heroine Mary Crawford, Jane Austen showed that she understood a rude joke about 'rears and vices'. Her side character Tom Bertram observed that Mrs Grant must lead a 'dull life' with the doctor and be in need of a lover. The assumed Prim Jane Austen does not exist.

We know that sex is not overt in Austen but much of the action of the novels depends upon it. If it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a large fortune must be in want of a wife, why is that? Because of male sexual desire; if a man has enough money to support a wife, it is assumed that he will want one. Mr Darcy is drawn to Elizabeth Bennet so strongly that all of his attempts to restrain himself are futile. He proposes even though he believes her to be an entirely unsuitable wife because he desires her. Mr Collins and Mr Elton are both characters described as being ready for marriage - this seems to be an Austen euphemism. Then there are the various husbands across all the books who seem to have blundered into wedlock with wives who they cannot respect because they were fooled by a fair face. Mr Bennet, Mr Palmer, John Knightley, Charles Musgrove - the list goes on. They may bicker, squabble or even ignore each other in public but plentiful offspring appear nonetheless. Even Charlotte Lucas, who manages her household so that she can spend as little time as possible with her husband, is pregnant by the end of Pride and Prejudice.

Pride and Promiscuity bases its humour on the assumption that Jane Austen definitely knew nothing about sex, therefore it is comedic to write a book with a version of her being depraved. Since we know that the first point is not true, the joke doesn't quite work. Rather than ignoring sex, Austen's novels are often poking fun at the extent to which human behaviour is driven by it. So if Pride and Promiscuity is not entirely successful as a parody, does it work as effective pornography? Well. Here, I have to admit that I am not really the right person to judge. But I think probably not. A fun read but not one I am ever likely to revisit."

Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,Ellie Pauline,"March 1, 2021",2.0,"This book is an odd read, and not for the reasons it would lead you to believe. Based on the title and premise (a rather flimsy premise of 2 Americans stumbling upon Austen's lost work) I would have expected this book to be either half decent erotica or a tongue and cheek humorous retelling of Austen's works. It somehow manages to be neither, and so while the stories were charming in their own way and an easy read I'm not convinced the authors achieved what they set out to with this novel."

Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,Milliebot,"November 4, 2014",3.0,"This review and others posted over at my blog .

From the back of the book: In 2002, an amateur Jane Austen scholar, while staying at Hertfordshire estate, stumbled upon a hidden cache of manuscript pages and made an extraordinary literary discovery - lost scenes from Jane Austen's novels that reveal an altogether different dimension of her oeuvre.

This book, much like The Princess Bride, would have you believe that it's contents are legitimate; except that William Goldman really tricked me into thinking his story was real :| . Eckstut proves that her findings of Auten's lost manuscripts are legitimate by including a letter of approval from English professor, Elfrida Drummond, authoress of splendid works, such as Pride in Punctuation and Proof and Prejudice. Alas, dear readers, Jane Austen didn't hide away sex scenes that her publisher refused to allow into all six of her novels, but this book was still a quick, quirky little read.

There's nothing erotic (in my opinion) about this novel, so if you're looking for detailed intimate moments between Elizabeth and Darcy, per say, you should probably look elsewhere. The best thing about this book is that Eckstut did her best to stick to the language of Austen's time and the scenes felt almost authentic. I say almost for two reasons: the writing doesn't really have Austen's voice, and some of the scenarios are too ridiculous to be believed. Re: Miss Bingley and Hurst involved in a threesome with Jane Bennett to test her marital suitability to Bingley. Again, there's nothing vulgar or overly explicit in the details, but the themes are intended for adult readers.

Some scenes made me roll my eyes - primarily the one mentioned above, but others did make me chuckle. Re: Emma pleasuring herself to the thought of how useful she is to everyone in her life and ""how essential she was to the flawless running of the household."" At 145 pages I didn't feel like I wasted my time, and I actually wished it were a little longer. Eckstut had some very clever moments and I would have loved to see them further developed, especially the comedic aspects. This book didn't blow me away, but if you're open-minded and in the mood for a chuckle or two, check it out! If you're looking for hot and heavy Regency-era action, I'd say look elsewhere."
Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,Sophia,"September 9, 2012",2.0,"Pride and Promiscuity was recommended as a funny read by a member of a Goodreads group I’m in, so I thought I’d give it a try. I wish I’d never bothered.

The book assumes that the author has discovered a hidden cache of explicit scenes which were cut from all Jane Austen’s famous novels. Austen, we are told, was not the typical 19th century prudish spinster; on the contrary, she had a very active imagination and invented all sorts of sexual shenanigans for her characters, which only the horrified consternation of her publishers forced her to cut. My suspension of disbelief was struggling before I’d even got to the scenes themselves, but it’s meant to be a funny book so I did at least try to get into the spirit of things!

Each of the novels has a couple of “lost” scenes, so you will need a pretty good knowledge of Austen’s work to remember who’s who. Some of these were extremely cringe-making, such as Jane Bennett being inspected for fitness to marry Mr Bingley by his sisters (eewwww!) and an incestuous scene between Henry and Mary Crawford from Mansfield Park. Wrong, just wrong. The idea that Jane Austen could have ever even thought of such things is a leap too far for my imagination, and there was a big part of me that thought this was little more than an insult to her memory. The style of writing was also decidedly off, and didn’t come anywhere close to matching Jane Austen’s own mastery of the English language.

You might ask what I expected when I ordered a book like this. I had hoped for a slightly risqué pastiche that would make me laugh, but this wasn’t it. There was just one scene that raised a small smile, in which Charlotte Lucas dresses up as Lady Catherine de Bourgh and takes a riding crop to Mr Collins! All the rest were pretty horrible."

It's not a long book, so I have already read it this evening. It's a bit silly, but quite entertaining. You do need to know the Jane Austen stories, otherwise the characters and how these imagined sex scenes fit into the originals won't mean so much. To be fair, although this is humour, she's done a pretty good job with the language and style and picking up on what kind of perverse little traits some of the characters might have had, were Jane Austen's books more explicit."

The idea is funny. I'm all for fan fiction, I'm all for erotic fan fiction. But this is just bad and really, really boring, surprisingly. I've seen a review saying that these ""found"" scenes don't fit in where they're supposed to be, and I've got to agree. A couple of the stories are also super uncomfortable to read. I'm usually a ""don't like don't read""-kind of fan fic reader, and I'm not a fan of the purity culture that's been really purvasive in fan culture for some time now. But I really don't like reading incest, and I doubt Austen would write a brother/sister couple... cousins? Yeah, that was a bit more normal from what a gather, but not brother and sister. And then there's the first story, which is probably the worst way to start a book ever. This story reads like a sexual assualt in my opinion. Jane does a lot of mental gymnastics to participate in what's happening, and I'm not here for it. Now that I think about it... the two strictly (there's a threesome, also with questionable consent) same-sex stories have consent issues. I find it kind of insulting that the lgbtq+ stories/interactions are painted in a predatory gross light.

I also think the author comes across as super arrogant. Part of it is just how the preface and introduction is written. She keeps writing in this old school style, even for the parts that's supposed to describes what happened whenever she ""found"" the lost chapters. It comes across as confused and annoying, and overall it doesn't work as a literary device.

I thought this was going to be funny but it really, really wasn't!"
Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,Christina,"May 24, 2020",,"Though a short book, I didn’t get very far into this before giving up on it. It’s fiction, of course, but written to seem like a scholarly work. There’s a fair amount of time devoted to a story about how the authors found the lost sex scenes Jane Austen’s editor forced her to cut, asserting their expertise in Austen. This is followed by an equally long faux introduction by an Austen scholar. After all the assurances of what experts the authors are in Austen and her voice, I expected more than what I found.

The “lost scenes” read like poorly written fan fiction. The book is sold with the premise that these scenes will sound like Austen, but instead it’s just bad purple prose. And not even good bad purple prose—there are people who love and understand the romance genre well enough to write hilariously intentionally bad sex scenes, and annual awards for the worst sex scenes of the year, probably unintentionally so, and equally hilarious (Google and enjoy.) Granted, I only tried two of these brief scenes and couldn’t bring myself to finish reading either, so maybe it gets better, but I’m not willing to invest the time to find out."
Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,S.J.,"June 30, 2018",3.0,"There are already very mixed reviews on this book. Although I have only read Sense and Sensibility (which I enjoyed) by Jane Austen I was quite intrigued when I saw this paperback version in a second hand store. I actually feel that this book has completed what it set out to do, and this is, to unearth 'the lost sex scenes of Jane Austen' - Although this is totally fabricated I felt that the 'lost scenes' were rather funny. I do feel that whether you are a Jane Austen fan or not, you do have to have a sense humour, adventure and an imagination to read this book. I think Arielle Eckstut gave herself a rather large task in trying to write these lost sex scenes, and I feel she has succeeded - So well done Arielle. As this book may be considered 'a little racy' I would recommend this be read by over 18's. I also feel that this book would be good on holiday or on long travels. And yes, even by the bedside!"
Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,amber,"March 9, 2022",3.0,"★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆

Do I believe this to be the actual work of Jane Austen? No. But did I overall enjoy it? Sure. The Introduction at the beginning of the book feels like them saying “This is a genuine lost work of Austen, just trust us.”

But I put that thought aside and just enjoyed the hilarity of the scenes that were included. If the introduction didn’t convince me of it’s authenticity, the outlandish snippets included didn’t help at all.

I will take one of the tamer scenes of Elizabeth and Darcy to show you what I mean:

I don’t really agree with the title so much because while some snippets are racy, others are pretty docile. But if the author is telling the truth that these are in fact unpublished pieces but Austen that were found and later revealed, I’m sure at that time these would be considered the “Fifty Shades” of that time period. It was interesting to read but not one of my favorites."
Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,Erin,"October 17, 2022",2.0,"…a lot of it seemed out of character. I know it’s not supposed to be realistic with attitudes about sex in the 19th century but there was maybe a little too much artistic freedom. The most enjoyable one would probably be between Elizabeth and Darcy; it was also the most in character so perhaps boring too. Emma’s was also in character, and the discussion between Marianne and Elinor Dashwood.

Uninvited,Courtney,"October 26, 2014",1.0,"I don't have a lot of any, really nice things to say about Uninvited, but I'd like to say upfront that I didn't expect to - and at the time I read this book, I was an easy reader to please. Books I cannot force myself to read now, are books I used to love...books that I dislike now, but can still see far outweigh Uninvited in quality. So while I didn't have any expectations for this book, I was still intrigued by the premise; boyfriend kills himself, returns as a member of the undead, haunts protagonist. Maybe it’s not the most inventive start, but I was still interested enough in the potential of the relationship dynamics to come. Alas.

According to summary, Jordan's life sucks. After (the summary claims it’s the other way around, but it’s not) dumps summer boyfriend Michael, he becomes a walking one-night-stand, and supposedly takes his own life a few weeks later. If that were not enough, Michael, Jordan's dearly departed ex, begins appearing at her window every night – no explanations, begging to be invited in. As Jordan feels her resistance slipping in every aspect of her life, she drifts closer and closer to letting him in.

The little blurb on the inside the book told me that Michael could only come in with Jordan's permission, and what I wanted to know was he wanted in. Why was that so important to him? Why, after his clear disinterest in her, did he choose her window to haunt? What was so particular about Jordan? While I can forgive my initial interest in finding these answers, I can't quite forgive this book or even myself for my inability to put down and just say, . It would have saved me some time and the hot mess that is this book.

was so absurdly plotted that I had to repeatedly stop and make sure that I hadn’t drifted off into a daydream or accidentally skipped ahead. Sometimes it was cliché in all the wrong places and all the wrong ways, and other times I just flat wondered how even managed to get published. It was, at times, nothing short of painful.

Another of my problems with was, among so many things, the lack of explanation. Michael, back from the dead, haunts Jordan’s window – it was the whys of this that hooked me, but the blatant ignorance of answering them that was the greatest pinch on my nerves. Jordan never seemed coherent or present, never seemed to get anywhere with her questions. I get that she lives in a state of depression and self-medication, but not even those issues were ever paid any attention to. Marrone failed, on every level, to draw any conclusions about Michael or Jordan as individuals.

This is really what irked me most about , the fact that the reader never learns anything about Michael or Jordan; nothing real, period. Michael in particular perplexed me. Marrone gave us two sides to him, which never converge in any way – Jordan’s sociable summer love and the self-absorbed jagweed. Ah, which reminds me!



Okay, back to Michael. So we see him sweetly dating her in the summer but then carelessly hooking up with the next girl to come his way after their breakup. Who Michael really is remains Marrone's greatest unanswered question, and she just didn't seem to care all that much. Meh.

Jordan was also definitely a problem. I was pretty certain that I was indifferent to whatever was going to happen to her, and that’s a shame. I understand grief and sadness and despair, but Jordan felt all of these things while being top of her class at TSTL University. Jordan is the girl of horror movie fame. Yes, girl. Her sense of self-preservation? Nonexistent. Her common sense? Down for the count, leave a message at the beep. It’s almost seems like she to meet a grisly end, for all her barefaced stupidity. And you know this, . But you still scream at her, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT GO INTO THE BATHROOM. NO. STAY PUT. CALL THE POLICE. .



While the more interesting aspects of Jordan and Michael’s post-mortem relationship are pointedly ignored, Jordan almost does .

“Don’t do the thing, Jordan!” the reader pleads."
Uninvited,Karen,"January 10, 2009",1.0,"I didn't enjoy this book, as my amazon review will state. I thought it was written like mediocore fanfiction with an overuse of exclamation points and under developed characters. Jordan seemed like she was supposed to be everything all rolled into one. Instead of her being complex, it came off as just a pile of issues...terrible mother, frienemies, drinking, smoking, drugs, highly sexual, drama club, track and field, and anxiety disorder. It's too much for a 200 page book especially when you add in that she's being stalked/haunted by her undead ex. Marrone tried to give this character layers but it just made me roll my eyes. I would have bought into some of the issues, the drinking, smoking, drugs, even the hyper sex if it was a result of the issue with the ex coming back from the ""dead"" like she was lashing out against it, or even if we were given another reason for it, but we weren't, not anything that really explained it. I just didn't like this book, it wasn't written well and the plot was weak."
Uninvited,Jennifer Wardrip,"November 16, 2012",4.0,"Reviewed by Lynn Crow for TeensReadToo.com

These days, Jordan's got a lot on her mind. Her social phobias are getting the better of her, she thinks she messed things up with a guy she really connected with... and her ex-boyfriend, popular jock Michael, has been appearing at her bedroom window since the night after his funeral. It seems the rumors that Michael killed himself aren't true -- he was attacked by a vampire, and became one himself. Now he wants Jordan to join him. Every night, he pleads and cajoles and turns on his charm, trying to get her to invite him in, and Jordan's arguments are starting to crumble.

UNINVITED is a tense, scary book that manages to throw in a little humor on the side. Marrone does a superb job of building the suspense about Michael's true intentions and how Jordan will deal with them. Nothing works out quite the way the reader will expect, and Jordan's struggles will have them on the edge of their seats, unable to put the book down. The climax is thrilling and dark, and the ending is hopeful without leaving its heroine unscarred.

It may take readers a little while to warm up to Jordan, whose binge-drinking and pessimistic ways may seem too depressing. But it quickly becomes clear that she has every reason to want to drown out the rest of the world. Her growth as she fights her fears and destructive tendencies is both believable and inspiring. The supporting characters are well-developed as well, from Michael's twisted personality to Jordan's quirky friend, Rachael.

Readers who enjoy books a little out of the ordinary, especially the dark and suspenseful, should run out and grab this one as soon as possible. It takes one of the most familiar creatures of the supernatural genre and manages to tell a story unlike any you've read before."
Uninvited,Kelly,"June 18, 2009",1.0,"Ok, someone passed this book along to me and I read it thinking it would be just another of the current 'vampire craze' books. Huh - NOT. The premise is good: a high school girl is trapped in her house from sundown to sun up every night because her first love (now dead... no, UNdead) sits in the tree beside her window begging her to let him in - he needs an invitation. I did like that the vampire in this story was actually an evil horrible being, not the current romanticized version that's everywhere. But the story was extremely bogged down in the explanation about how bad the main character's life is right now, complete with very graphic descriptions of all the drugs she's taking, all the alcohol she's liberating from her parents' stash, and how many guys she's 'hooked up' with out of apathy or self-loathing. Billed as a young adult novel, I found it completely inappropriate for young adults. Whatever was good in the story was lost for me because of that. So my suggestion is to skip this book. No, seriously. Don't bother."
Uninvited,Emiilia HelloBookLovers,"September 8, 2010",1.0,"The book was boring =(. I honestly tried to find something good about this book. It was a waste of time, and a waste of money. If you really want to read this book well, buy a USED books from Amazon.com there are about 1.72 for the used book. Sorry, people but it's the worst book I've ever read.

Its all about the girl going high school getting drunk doing drugs, and doing guys. Although this book sounds intresting to read when I read the reviews and the books description, NOTHING GOOD REALLY HAPPENDS.

At the end of the book, after I fell asleep time and time again, it started to get a little better, 50 pages before the books ended. If you really want to read this book, you should start reading it almost at the END OF THE BOOK, because all the beginning of the book is nonsense. Well, Don't Say I Didn't Warn You.

Uninvited,Nic,"January 29, 2010",4.0,"This is the story of Jordan and her dead ex boyfriend who comes back to her window every night wanting her to let him in and the choices she has to make.

I really enjoyed this book. I got pulled into the story within first few pages and finished the books in a few hours (it is only 204 pages so its a quick read). There wasnt any twists or suspense in this story like most parnormal stories but I liked the main character Jordan and her struggles to deal with her situation. Actually I would say there very little parnormal in this story.

This book is meant for teenagers but I would recommend it for ages 16 up as has references to drugs and sex.

I am definetly interested in reading more from Amanda Marrone."
Uninvited,Shannon Reid,"June 22, 2015",1.0,I read this book when I was twelve and hated it so much that I started a fire in the woods and burned it.
Uninvited,Ozen,"June 19, 2010",2.0,"The world is ending. I know it. If the world is infested with sex crazed, pot smoking, beer drinking teenagers such as the ones in this book then I know for sure this world is doomed.

It simply amazes me that such people exist. Or is the author trying too hard? Does she really think teenagers are like that these days? Because I know for sure I wont sleep with a new guy every week just because I dumped my old asshole of a boyfriend.

Gosh there are just so many things wrong with this book. But mainly the drugs and drinking. I mean I it..teenagers got problems and sometimes they drown their sorrows in less than appropriate ways.. but I dont need to spend 200 pages reading about that!!

Anyways..getting back on track.
So, there's also Michael, Jordan's dead vampire ex-boyfriend who comes to her window every night asking her to let him in. Problem is... she knows she wants to but luckily what little common sense she has is telling her not to. And we spend maybe 3/4 of the book reading about Jordan's less than intelligent conversations with Michael every night. Unfortunately for us poor readers, that's just about all that happens.

I bet some of us out there were hoping that Michael was really going to steal Jordan away from all her troubles and be her knight in shining armor. That was about the only thing that kept me reading throughout the entire book; the hope that Jordan would find salvation somehow from her hell. But too bad that thought was blasted to hell when it turned out Michael was just a psycho dead guy who really doesnt want the best for Jordan."
Uninvited,Emma,"May 13, 2010",1.0,"I regret spending money on this because A) after about 70 pages nothing happened and B) I am having a hard time liking the main character.

For such a badass pot smoking, drinking, partying girl, Jordan's personality is completely the opposite of all that. Who she is and what she does just doesn't seem to match.

Also I felt like I was thrown in the middle of a book because nothing was explained right, people were mentioned without us being told who they were, and it was just terribly written.

Also there were alot of words in there that made me think, hang on, is she making up words? Or even if they are real words, they're stupid words that aren't used in proper context. This sounds like it was written by a teenager who has nothing better to do than write about her boring life and every little boring detail about boring school without actually explaining why its important to talk about it, or explaining it in the first place. Not to mention the use of seemingly big and important words that just don't fit and make her sound so stupid.

I've never been more frustrated reading a book. Seriously. I didn't finish it, I just skimmed it and honestly I just saw more characters being mentioned that had nothing to do with anything, and no actual plot.

Faaail!"
Uninvited,Nan,"October 28, 2009",4.0,"This is an incredibly good book, one that doesn't flinch from portraying the reality of teen's lives and mixing it with a good dose of fantasy.

I did find Jordan annoying several times, but that was part of the point of the book.

I'll try to come back later and write a longer (and hopefully better) review, but I'll settle right now for saying that this was good story told by a solid storyteller."
Uninvited,Jasmyn,"February 18, 2022",1.0,This was a ridiculous.
Uninvited,Alison,"February 24, 2010",1.0,"Uninvited is 100% completely and utterly a ‘young adult’ book. Don’t be mislead into thinking that because you’re an adult who enjoyed Twilight you will enjoy this!

I count myself very lucky that my introduction to Amanda Marrone’s work was through Devoured, which I thought to be an original story with some quite thrilling moments. If I’d started with Uninvited I would never have touched another one of her books.

I’m guessing that if you’re a teenager in the 14-19yr old bracket (which is the target market) you’ll enjoy it. Covers the world of teen age binge drinking, excessive sex, school, peer issues, all the sorts of things you can relate to. Not to mention the group of friends who really are only friends because they all snort coke and wallow in self pity because their parents suck. Yes, yes, I’m sure I was just as bad when I was that age, but you know what – I now understand my mother’s eye-roll when I ‘told’ her that she just didn’t understand.

The basic story is Rose dated a guy over the summer break over a year ago. Turns out he was popular, so she had a panic attack and dumped him. Many months later he is killed, becomes a vampire and starts stalking her. Interesting concept right? Sadly, it took most of the book to be told that she’d dumped him. We weren’t actually told he was a vampire for ages (although not hard to work out). What we got was lots of ‘what about me’.

One thing I didn’t like about Devoured was the very, very ,first person way of writing, unfortunately it’s even worse in this. Until we get near the end of the book and there is a bit of action we’re pretty much in Roses head. “I think, I said, I thought... I ,I, I”.

I would dearly like to see a review of this written from a younger perspective as other than my issue with the overuse of first person dialogue, the story is actually well written. It really is the subject matter and delivery of said subject matter that is causing me to rate this story so low. I still have Revealers, Amanda Marrones 2nd book sitting on my bookcase waiting to be read, so I am looking forward to seeing how that goes, whether there is a gradual growth, or if Devoured is just an exception.

I do have to point out – these are not part of a series. Amanda Marrone has (to date) published three books: Uninvited, Revealers and Devoured. These are all individual, stand alone books."
Uninvited,kfactorreads,"June 11, 2011",1.0,"To start off, honestly, this book was awful. Characters, plot line, mood, all of it. It is about a girl named Jordan who doesn't exactly do the right things. She drinks, partys, and does drugs. Her best friend Rachael is a lot worse. For the past 3 months Jordan is stalked by her ex boyfriend, who has just died and has come back as a vampire. He is at her window everynight and is just creepy.

All of the characters are one dimensional and are not written well. Jordan just complains and drinks all the time and Micheal, the ex boyfriend, doesn't make a good vampire at all. Most of the time I just want to yell at both Micheal and Jordan. They are both annoying, especially Micheal. Micheal is just plain creepy.

Plus I don't think that this book had a good plot line in the first place. It is very slow and boring for most of the book. There isn't a main focus either. It sort of goes all over the place.

The only kinda good thing about this book is that the last 50 pages are ok. It has a good ending, but that's about it.

Sorry this was sort of a rant about the book, but I have to be honest!

Uninvited,Britt,"January 6, 2019",2.0,"2.5 Stars.

Meh. The plot wasn’t terrible, but it was very thin-veiled and I feel like not a whole lot happened in a long amount of time. There were a few things that didn’t add up, and Michael made a poor vampire character. Not, like, Edward Cullen bad, but just... not very interesting. A lot of the vampire lore stayed true to classic vampire tales (I didn’t know vampires were repelled to water until reading this book), but, as with the rest of the plot, it was very thinly veiled.

Also, I’m not usually a snob when it comes to sex and drugs in books, but it seemed to be all the main character talked about (when she wasn’t worrying over being stalked by a vampire, that is).

You do drugs. We get it. You do alcohol. We get it. You have sex. We get it. That doesn’t make you any more of an interesting character — it just makes you a cringey, underage developing alcoholic who happens to like dick."
Uninvited,Carmaletta Hilton,"April 11, 2009",1.0,"This was a conglomeration of almost every vampire myth from the old school vampire stories. With so many books around that romanticize vampires and makes them sexy, this had the opportunity to be a really good book about an evil, no-good vampire. That said, it failed miserably. The characters were bland and unlikable, save for maybe Lisa at the end, and Michael was comical. Our main character is supposed to have social anxiety disorder so bad that she can befriends people she doesn't even like so she can walk through the halls of her high school, and yet she has no problem going to parties full of drunk people? She whines a lot, the world is against her, ""oh woe is me"" seems to be her regular state of being. I didn't care enough about her to care one way or another what happened to her.

Good idea, poorly executed."
Uninvited,Heather G Gentle,"September 18, 2008",1.0,"One of the worst books I've read. I got this from a ""bargain book"" shelf for $3 and I feel I paid too much.
This book is written in a prose for a 12 year old-- but the main character-- and all of her friends-- are promiscuous, drug taking drunks who have conversations about wanting to ""nail"" teachers, where they'll get their next weed stash and how their boyfriends ""fluids"" taste. Not exactly what I'd want my 12 year old to be reading. But-- it's not written for an adult either-- I can't determine who this would be written for.
For even more fun--the girl has pet cockroaches.

Good IDEA for a story-- but honestly-- what a waste.
The good part-- if you are over 12-- it would probably suck only an hour out of your life."
Uninvited,✦BookishlyRichie✦,"November 27, 2010",1.0,"So one day at the Library I picked up the novel ""Uninvited"" By Amanda Marrone & thought HEY! this seems interesting since I LOVE vampires & all. But after the first few chapters I got super bored & skimmed through most of it just to save myself from chucking the book across the room (Though I hate damaging books!). The characters were decent but the plot had huge holes and the story was too quick and the subject of teen drinking was overdone and super un-needed and could have survived from my eyes with a stronger storyline. Since this was Amanda's debut I will not hold anything against her because my debut happens to come out soon but it could have been way better."
Uninvited,Videoclimber(AKA)MTsLilSis,"October 6, 2014",1.0,"SIGH! I so wanted to find something, anything, good about this book. The only part of the book I could stand to read was the last section with the ""encounter"". The book was just so boring. It was a short read but seemed like it took forever to finish. The writing was not very well done and seemed to be bogged down with teen speak. This would have been better as a short story with just the last section and the beginning all condensed. The action scene was easy to read. The rest was just repeat after repeat. The days were all the same and just boring. I wouldn't waste your time with this one, there are much better vampire books out there!"
Uninvited,Janine Keyes,"July 20, 2022",3.0,"Funny, easy read. Just had to break up the long, engrossing books I’ve been reading and it did the job. It was odd with her thoughts and how it played into the timeline but overall not bad! Reminded me of 2012 vampire books a bit."
Uninvited,Reading Sarah,"September 20, 2009",4.0,"Jordan is a smart kid, she makes good grades even though her school attendance is sporadic at best. Her attendance problems and social anxiety were bad and are now terrible, because her ex-boyfriend, Michael, is a vampire whose haunting her every night. The vampire in this book follows very Dracula/folkloric traditional rules. Crosses and holy water, stakes through the heart are all going to hurt, he can turn into mist and bats. And he has to be invited in order to enter a building. Gorgeous Michael, despite telling Jordan that he still loves her and begging her to let him come in, is no Edward Cullen. He's a monster, and Jordan determines that quite likely he always was. The day she broke up with him because of her social anxiety he hooked up with a cheerleader later that day. He hung out with jerks, he thought he was th This book, as much as it seems like it might about paranormal love paradoxes is really and truly about issues. Jordan has social anxiety, a completely unstructured life with parents so laid-back it is hard to tell if they even care, and to top it off she self-medicates with any substance she can get ahold of...booze, coke, etc. Her friends Jordan's life has gotten so bad that she's starting to wonder if maybe she shouldn't just let Michael in. One of her three friends in the world is actually someone she truly likes, but they all feed her dysfunctions. I like the way Jordan goes from letting her issues get the best of her to getting the best of them, and her blood-sucking ex-boyfriend. I love the way that the creepy manipulations of Michael and his overuse of the word ""Love"" actually comes off as creepy and horrible, instead of Twilight-esque sparkly vampire love manipulations. Really I was a little pleased and surprised by the directions this book took, and even though it was slow in parts (how many examples of vomiting from excessive substance abuse do you really need?), I'm glad I stuck it through."
Uninvited,An Abundance of Books,"July 14, 2010",4.0,"You know Michael is a vampire and Jordan knows Michael is a vampire, but that's pretty much the end of my expectations. Uninvited doesn't dwell on Michael's death and how it affects Jordan - Michael's harassment/stalking actually forces her to reflect on her life. Jordan is basically a shy girl with some odd anxieties, but it all relates to the fact that her shyness has limited her social skills. She started dating Michael the summer he moved to town, and their relationship went faster than she wanted it to, but she was too happy to have Michael in her life, so she let it go. She actually breaks up with him because she so afraid of the attention the relationship brings her once school starts.
Her mother basically ignores her, when she isn't unknowingly implying that Jordan isn't pretty or good enough. Jordan feels she has no one to turn to when Michal starts showing up outside her window. He alternately tells her he loves her and threatens her in order to gain access to her room. Jordan's life starts to unravel and she sinks further into unhealthy behaviors. She goes to parties, drinks too much, smokes pot, and has started having sex with the occasional stranger. When an old childhood friend finds out about Michael, she forces Jordan into accepting her help and actually doing something about the vampire, as opposed to remaining a victim.

Oh my goodness, I totally loved this book. It was so very unexpected! I got so frustrated with Jordan, who seemed to accept this inevitable road to self destruction and eventual death or eternal life with Michael. When Lisa, the old friend, forces Jordan to accept her help, Jordan starts to understand that there is more to people than gossip or social expectation. when she starts to edge away from her current group of friends, who aren't a good influence, she finds that one of them really is a strong and good friend. And the reason for Michael visits... loved it! I definitely recommend this books - such a fun read."
Uninvited,Steen,"April 23, 2009",4.0,"Too much drug abuse and alcoholism, but the characters were likable--except for Michael, of course...
It was nice to see shy little Jordan go from a wasted alcoholic druggie to a clean and sober, strong young woman. Who totally killed a vampire.
Which, oops, makes this review a spoiler. Darn. Well, in that case, I can go more into detail.
Gabby and Janine sound like typical B-class losers who think they're all that and a slice of cheese (I have no clue if that's a real saying. But I like it. So deal.) They seem to care about Jordan, but are completely tactless, dramatic, and just a bit on the slow side. Blah.
Rachael gets offended to easily, but is someone who everyone loves to hate--so of course they love her. (I mean, come on. If her hair's not a mohawk, it's purple. Which rocks.) She seems to be the one friend Jordan can count on at the end, after her oldest friend, Lisa, bails out on her.
But Lisa was desperate, so you can't even hate her. Poor girl.
I liked it except for the frequent partying...and I love Danny. Super sweet. The end."
Uninvited,Kathy (Kindle-aholic),"January 16, 2011",2.0,"This one is between 2 and 3 stars for me. It's a bit of a tough one. On the one hand, the parents are horrific - they are even more absent and self-absorbed than you usually find in these books (for how else can their child be numbing themselves with drugs, alcohol and random sex with near strangers without some kind of intervention). The main character has a lot of problems (see previous sentence), but also a dead ex-boyfriend who has become a vampire and stalks her every night. It was hard to read about and to root for a teenage character that was so self-destructive. I felt sorry for her, and you saw moments where she was thinking of her friends, but those were few, although I can imagine that being stalked by your vampire ex-boyfriend would make you fairly self-absorbed.

I have to say that I did like that the vampire was not a nice, sparkly one. I also like that the nice guy isn't given the shaft. It's unique in teen romance, where the nice boy is usually relegated to just being the friend, the one who is a constant source of support, while the bad boy gets the girl."
Uninvited,Sue,"November 20, 2016",1.0,"I thought the plot sounded interesting, but the book turned out to be very disappointing. I almost gave up in the early stages but managed to push through to the end. I don’t think it was very well written and the opening was weird, making me feel like I had missed something important to the story. And nothing interesting really seemed to happen throughout the whole book. I didn’t like the main character at all, in fact, none of the characters were likeable. A couple of the characters supposedly had mental health issues, but this was glossed over and treated, I felt, inappropriately. The whole book was full of high school teens taking part in constant underage drinking, drug use, promiscuous behaviour, and didn’t seem to have any genuine friends and all came from dysfunctional families. This book was a terrible read and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone."
Uninvited,Taylor,"September 12, 2018",2.0,"I was in Middle School when I read this book and at the time I was obsessed with anything paranormal ghost,vampires, and witches you name it I liked it.

Like many of those in my youth we made mistakes we decide to read books that we thought we're good even amazing and we come back now and realize they were stupid.

When I first read this book I did really enjoy it but now as I look back I don't know why. The main character just annoyed me I understand she was going through a traumatic experience in her life but it just made her look week she seem to not be healing in anyway. By the end of this book you really don't find out all or any of the answers you want. This book fails in all ways and makes me feel ashamed for reading this.

No I would not recommend this book to anybody else.
No I would not read more books by this author."
Uninvited,Gokce G,"February 14, 2010",2.0,"I read someone's review about this one saying it felt like a long fanfiction, I agree. While reading it I had a fanfiction vibe from it, it was as if the author had the intention to write a story about vampires and then decided to extend it to a book.

It wasn't a bad read, it was a bit dark at times since it also included some teen angst, sex and use of drugs and alcohol, but still it was ok. The dialogues, especially coming from teens, seemed a bit long to be true at times, although I can't really remember how I talked when I was a teenager, and the story unfolded a bit too quickly. The reactions to the realisation of the existence of a vampire seemed a bit too rushed too, hence not very believable, so overall, it was an ok book. 2, maybe even 1.5 stars, but I went with 2."
Uninvited,Alex,"August 20, 2010",1.0,"When I bought this book at the store I thought, ""Gee, this looks interesting."" I was wrong. I still cry a little inside when I think about the money that I spent on Uninvited.
This book was a waste of time, money, and space on my bookshelf. At the end of the book, I still didn't feel a connection with any of the characters. The vampire still felt as foreign as a minor character, the novel moved way too slow., and fifty pages into the book nothing happened. The only thing that kept me reading this book were my friends (and at points I was pretty sure they weren't going to be able to convince me to finish it).Overall the story had an interesting concept (over used but still interesting) but was executed in a poor manner."
Uninvited,Eileen,"March 15, 2009",2.0,"If you want a YA book in the vampire fiction line, this one is clearly superior. The vampire-human relationship is an abusive one; this stalker hates and would kill Jordan, the protagonist, and is certainly affecting her psyche and behavior the way an actual stalker would. There's no Bella thinking Edward is so adorable when she discovers he's been watching her sleep for months. No. This relationship is dangerous and destructive, and can only be resolved by Jordan taking action. Melodramatic and not well-written, but a far healthier read than Twilight."

Jordans family and few friends can't ever know about her biggest of her problems: That ever since Michael Greenwood died, night life has lost its appeal.

A wonderfully bloodcurdling tale will keep you fliping through page numbers until the astonishing end."
Uninvited,Saymon,"December 16, 2009",4.0,I really liked the thrill in the book. Everyone likes books that make you jump when something happens and that is exactly what this book will make you do.

It was like a TV in your head. I strongly recommend this book to everyone.

Uninvited,Nikki,"June 28, 2009",5.0,Uninvited is a wonderful story. It a new twist on the idea of vampires and how life is.

The logic behind this authors arguments is flawed. In Phase 1 of the diet he stresses over and over about illuminating hormones and such by eating only organic food.

"The Weight Loss Cure """"They"""" Don't Want You to Know About",Iona Stewart,"August 3, 2011",2.0,"I'll begin by saying I admire Kevin Trudeau tremendously for his immense work in educating us, the masses, as to how to protect ourselves from environmental toxins, cleanse these from our bodies and eat optimally in order not to repollute ourselves. I admire him also for his tremendous courage in doing so in the face of threats to his life and well-being.

The present book deals with the only genuine weight solution known to Kevin Trudeau, one he himself has used with total success. This is Simeons' weight loss cure protocol whose most important element is the injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin, or hCG, a hormone-like substance created in the bodies of pregnant women, every day for a minimum of three weeks. This treatment resets the hypothalamus and bodyweight setpoint and releases, fantastically, the fat stored in the ""abnormal problem area secure fat reserves"". Thus fat is now lost in areas where it never previously could be lost due to a damaged hypothalamus.

The above-mentioned injections constitute the essential phase 2 of the treatment, but all phases (1-4) require specific dietary adjustments plus dozens of other measures.

I am in absolutely no doubt that this cure works for practically every-one - every overweight person who strictly follows the various requirements of the protocol will lose weight in the problem areas, and will be enabled to maintain the weight loss with proper adherence to the stated requirements.

My problems with the cure or with Kevin's book, are as follows:

1) Kevin does not mention the cost, approximate or otherwise, of the protocol.

2) It is required to find a doctor or health care practitioner to administer the protocol, and only one is mentioned, who has a clinic in Europe (doctors in the USA are apparently forbidden to prescribe hCG).

3) I get the impression that Kevin assumes that all readers are, if not millionaires like himself, at least absolutely wealthy. I know that wealth is a matter of consciousness and it is theoretically possible for us all to attract wealth, but we're not all there YET.

Even without taking the cost of the treatment into consideration, travelling to the doctor administering it, when and if you manage to find one, in addition to carrying out the multifarious requirements (taking various organ cleanses, doing colonics, purchasing various herb teas, a rebounder, a Q-link, shower filter, stress reducing CDs, getting massages, doing resistance training, etc. etc. etc.) would immensely exceed the buying power of my income.

Moreover, Kevin's grammar, spelling, and first and foremost sentence structure are atrocious. The content of the book and all his books is absolutely of massive importance, but why doesn't he find some literate person to ""repair"" his writing?

To sum up, this book can be a life-saver for those prosperous, overweight persons who are sufficiently strong-minded and focused to get hold of the hCG and a willing doctor or health-care practitioner to administer the procedure, but is immensely frustrating for those of lesser means."
"The Weight Loss Cure """"They"""" Don't Want You to Know About",Elisheva Creve,"July 16, 2007",3.0,"I took this book of of the library after a bout with insomia and his infomerical appeared. As someone who has been struggling with a weight problem for 2/3 of my life, I am getting desparate to lose weight. Even though I eat reasonably healthy and exercise (does chasing after two kids count?), my weight does not budge.

My favorite part of the book, aside from the entertainment I received when he described the conspiracy that the food companies and the US government are in to make people fat (and be treated by the health care industry), was when he pointed out that most diet books are either written by someone who has never been fat or someone who is still fat (but if advice actually worked, then they would no longer be fat).

According to the book, chemicals are being added to our food to make us addicted to it and therefore, get fat. In order to ""cure"" yourself of obesity, you have to take yourself completely off of processed foods, eat only organic, do a bunch of detox cleanses, and finally, spend six weeks getting injections of an illegal (in US) hormone that burns off the fat.

He uses the standard techniques of telling people not to believe commericals or celebrity endorsements (because he knows what they are really about) and showing how he is being persecuted for telling people the truth. He is a self-annointed ""whistle blower"" on the FDA and FTC.

He divides this cure into four phases. The first one, aside from the suggestions of 15 colonics in 30 days (HOLY CRAP!) and detox cleansing are reasonable. No processed foods, drink 1 gallon a day of water, a lot of different teas (green tea, yerba mate), walk 1 hour daily, and eat six times a day. The second phase involves a six week protocol of daily hCG injections and getting by on a 500 calorie diet. The third part involves working to reset your hypothalamus (the reason why we are fat is because our hypothalamus is out of wack and we have no control over our hunger, something that I learned in college psychology class...there are really people who get fat ""just by looking"" at a piece of cheesecake), and finally if all this works to your satisfaction, you will be ""cured"" of obesity.

Like his preceding two books about Natural Cures, the most pertinent information is available (for a fee, of course) at his website []."
"The Weight Loss Cure """"They"""" Don't Want You to Know About",John,"September 18, 2008",5.0,"WOW!! What an amazing book! I approached this book with an open mind due to the fact that i have had a weight issue my whole life
(16 years)and have tried everything out their (Slim fast, Weight Watchers, Nutrisystem, Vegan diet, Eat Right For Your type,etc...)
I even did two seasons of wrestling in jr. high, nothing helped. so i went through my Freshman year of high school in a basic state of dpression beacause of my weight. I thought that there was no way out.

Then I my grandmother (who is also overweight) recommended this book to me and I thought ""why not? i've tried everything else."" but first i wanted to make sure that this guy was legitament, so I did my homework for months before i took my first injection of HCG.

Yes, the authore is a fruad and a convicted felon, but who better to tell us about Government lies than a lier? When i talked to a docter about this ""diet."" he immedeatly told my that it was dangourus and not to do it, but thats what i expected. So after Months of reaserch i finally found where to buy some HCG () and me and my brother did the diet together. Its completly changed our lives up untill now.

The first time i did it i lost 45 pounds!! I went from 285 to 240 in 6 weeks (I have done it once so far, but need to do it agian). My bro has done it twice and has so far lost 80 pounds!! he looks incredible!! anyway anyone who needs to lose weight, Please do not shy away from the plan outlined in this book, It is a pathway to freedom that people like us (fat people) cannot experiance normaly.

Is alarmist and with a conspiracy theory tone that I found almost insulting. I would rather it had been more science based. Currently no definitive proof that HCG is more than just a placebo. The protocol is extreme and controversial with many conflicting testimonials. There is some valid information in the book on the current state of our food supply and the overall toxicity in our environment. And I would probably try the protocol under medical supervision if I had a need for it and nothing else had worked.

Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Michelle,"November 3, 2021",1.0,"2021 Update: I got to page 368 and finally decided that I'd allowed it enough space in my brain and on my shelf. This is a literary ransom note made of snipped-up Bible phrases and fortune cookie messages, but what do you expect from a literal child? It should have stayed snug in a drawer or on a computer, to be looked over years later out of a sense of nostalgia. Instead it's the inciting event of yet another story of internet humiliation. Just go read some of the blogs reviewing Maradonia, they're shorter, wittier, and they have no delusions of grandeur.

2018 Update: This book's biggest flaw in terms of readability is definitely the pacing. Whether it's awkwardly placed descriptions, rambling conversations or even the quirk of using two descriptors for each thing (i.e., ""They were interested in building a control station and outpost""), this book just drags.

Yes, I've added a star to this review. This book has caused much laughter throughout my household, and since the purpose of fiction is to entertain, it qualifies. Maradonia and the Seven Bridges is the worst fantasy book I've ever read--if one can even honestly call it a book. It is one of those rare, magical moments where everything goes wrong--characters, plot, pacing, mythology, description, dialogue, continuity, grammar, spelling, punctuation, even the FONT inspires giggles.

If anyone is confused, I have read through a very detailed sporking of this book, and have recently begun reading the original--hence the review for a book I have technically not finished.

The plot is hackneyed, unoriginal and disjointed, and my spell-checker would have a heart attack at the sight of one page. Random ""words"" get ""quotation marks,"" italics or ""both."" I've seen better formatted fanfiction. The ""characters,"" Maya and Joey, are paper-thin idiots treated as intelligent heroes. Joey is especially unbearable, constantly spouting ""wisdom"" that anyone with a teaspoonful of brains could deflate and outdoing all of the villains put together in selfishness and pointless cruelty. The most unique element of this story is the outright plagiarism from the Bible. Some passages are nearly word-for-word--and yet, Miss Tesch completely misses the point of the passages she inserts.

Here is one shining example of all of my greatest problems with this book: Joey decides to test their troops by declaring that nobody can eat or drink for three days. Maya doesn't like the plan at first, but after seeing the results she calls it splendid and brilliant. On the third they cull the army with a ""who drinks straight from the river vs using their hands"" test.

One: a healthy human cannot live for three days without water. I know this through Google. A large portion of the army are teens and children, explicitly stated to be younger than the 14-year-old Joey, not healthy adult men. They should all be dead.

Two: this is a mashup of two Biblical stories, 1st Samuel 14:24-46 and Judges 7:4-7. The first was when King Saul made a (rash) vow that nobody should eat or drink until he'd avenged himself on an enemy--and then went and fought a battle. Guess what, everyone including his own son said it was a stupid decision, and it didn't even last an entire day. The second is part of the story of Gideon, where God trims down Gideon's army to the point of absurdity, so that when they win there's no doubt that He was the reason they had the victory. There is no good reason for the ""Encouragers"" to do this to their army.

Three: On the third day, Joey proceeds to wander through the camp eating and drinking. I assume the only reason he wasn't immediately lynched was because his ""men"" (again: mostly teenagers and kids) were too weak to move, which is a pity.

Miss Tesch, if you stumble across this while Googling yourself, please don't take this personally. I'm a homeschooled girl who likes to write, like you, and I'm not jealous of you. I know how painful it can be to have some story you've worked hard on criticized. I don't hate you--though if you paid the ""editor"" of your book, you were ripped off. I even ""saved"" it from being removed from this site. Please, stop embarrassing yourself with deceptive, self-aggrandizing advertisement, and go back and read the Book you've plagiarized so very often with a willingness to be taught, absorbing the meaning, not just the style."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Honorius Black,"September 12, 2014",1.0,"The impression you'd get from the reviewer ""Sam"" is that this is the best thing since sliced bread and that you should TOTALLY buy this BRILLIANT work of ART.

The book is a mess. Not even drinking games will make this a worthwhile read unless you have a penchant for seeking out and mocking horrific writing. In which case, proceed at your leisure.

If you want to learn how not to write something, this series is that collection of textbooks you've been looking for. Feel free to get out the highlighter, as each page has some choice piece of malignant prose to offer.

There are redundancies, paradoxisms, half-baked philosophies, an overflow of fridge logic, and even simple spelling errors. It's everything you'd expect if the book was written by a child with little-to-no concept of story writing.

Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Janine,"July 12, 2011",1.0,"This is basically the Rebecca Black of self-published books.... without the ironic rise to fame, of course. It's always amazing when something is so bad in just the right way that it becomes more successful as a meme than as its intended purpose, and this is exactly one of those rare gems. I've only been able to read parts of this mess online, but I've heard from many reviewers that the actual books themselves are just as physically shoddy and poorly held-together as the writing and story, how appropriate. I wasn't sure whether this deserved a 5 for its unintended entertainment value, but in the end I'll have to be honest.....it's 1 star or less, in every real sense."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,EA Solinas,"April 30, 2011",1.0,"If you've heard of Gloria Tesch, you've probably heard that she promotes herself as the youngest novelist in the world. Well, she's not.

And even if she were, her debut novel ""Maradonia and the Seven Bridges"" wouldn't exactly be a rousing advertisement for teenage authors. This self-published disaster is a meandering plotless mess, making its way through a sludgy mixture of cutesy fantasy, horrible Christian symbolism, and writing bad enough to make your eyeballs burn.

Maya and Joey are a pair of Mary-Sueish teenagers who meander onto a mysterious beach that transports them into a world of talking animals, house-sized sunflowers, and an army conveniently waiting for them to show up. They are soon informed that they are the Encouragers of Maradonia... which means they... have to encourage people. Yeah, it's stupid.

So they are immediately recruited by the kindly King Astrodolous to defeat the evil King Abbadon, which seems to involve a lot of rescuing mermaids and unicorns while blurting out ridiculous pseudo-philosophy (""Every living creature in this world has a soul and everything what lives has eyes and ears and a voice!"").

Obviously ""Maradonia and the Seven Bridges"" is a blatant ripoff of C.S. Lewis' Narnia stories, but that doesn't really do justice to the mind-blowing horror of this book. There is not one chapter, one page, one SENTENCE that does not drip ineptitude from every word, to the point where a parody could not rival its ridiculousness.

Part of this is because Tesch is just a horrible writer -- her book really has no plot, and she tries to distract us from that by cramming in simplistic Christian symbolism, nonsensical perils (oh no, a random puddle of toxic waste!), and storylines that go absolutely nowhere. Even worse, her dialogue. It's full if bizarre non sequiturs, run-on sentences, random quotation marks and italicization. And it makes absolutely no sense.

Here's a small sampling of her writing style... and keep in mind, it is like this on every PAGE:

""The `Land of Maradonia' is a land between lands or let me explain it with these words `a space between spaces' and you came bodily into this land.""
""Mountains cannot be conquered! You conquer yourself! You conquer your fears and can conquer your own future but you will never conquer a mountain!""

And Tesch doesn't make up for this with likable characters -- Maya is pretty much useless, and Joey is absolutely vile. There are seemingly thousands of other characters who are never fleshed out at all, and Tesch manages to completely forget about one of them for about half the book.

""Maradonia and the Seven Bridges"" is far, far worse than you would expect a teenage girl's book to be -- there are books by preteens that are superior in quality. The best thing I can say about it is... nothing."

Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Vicious Ink,"July 10, 2012",1.0,"So, I made a review on Drew Markus's revew, and while it shows up on his account, it doesn't seem to be showing up on the actual page. So, in order to not run the risk of it being deleted or lost, I'm putting it as a stand alone review in response his post:


A couple of ""average kids"" go through a ""secret portal"" and find an ""alternate world"" where they become ""instant royalty"" and fulfill an ""ancient prophesy."" That doesn't sound familiar to you? You've never heard of C.S. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia?
Grammar isn't a guideline, it's a rule; an inflexible law of the literary universe. It's the gravity of the written word. A teen author is not exempt from that; if anything being a teenager makes it twice as important that the writing be above par. When I was ten, I wrote a story about a group of kids who go back in time onto the Titanic. The writing reflected that I was ten and I never gave any thought to publishing it. Gloria’s writing also reflects that she was ten, and it was a bad decision on her parents to send it to publishing when it was the clearly novice work of a very young girl.
Maya and Joey weren’t relatable at all. First of all, Gloria’s character started out as a pair of high school students when Gloria was still in elementary school. She had no idea what the social structure of a high school is like, and that was glaringly obvious. Maya was also an unrelenting Mary-Sue. She’s a beautiful, brilliant, talented, artistic, strong etc. ad nauseum, and the character of Joey is even worse.
Really? You’re going to compare the work of a self-published adolescent girl to one of the most prolific and talented modern fairytale writers of our time? Are you joking? Neil Gaiman, the author of Coraline, Graveyard Book, Sandman, and co-author of Good Omens isn’t as good as Gloria Tesch? The two aren’t even comparable. That’d be like comparing a garage band made up entirely of seven-year-old boys to Aerosmith.
I’ll agree that authors like Tolkien or Goodkind go way too far overboard with world building, but Gloria has almost none at all. She drops in a sentence or two about this magnificent world she’s supposed to have created, but you never see the world. She knows nothing about the concept of show-don’t-tell and there is no such thing as unimportant grammar. Once again, it’s a literary law.
The world has lost fairy tales? Really? Are Libba Bray, Jim Butcher, Terry Pratchett, Holly Black, Rob Thurman and Simon R. Green figments of my imagination? People who write fairy tales don’t edit them out of their stories; that would be counterproductive.
What you don’t understand is that there is more to building a story than “and then they did this, this, and this and they all loved happily ever after.” It’s a process of creating a believable and enticing world that is rich and complicated and insights emotions. Scary moments in a story should scare the reader, not say “and they were scared.” Again, it’s the rule of show-don’t-tell. If grammar is gravity, show-don’t-tell is the also unbreakable rule of exponents.
I personally hope that Gloria Tesch puts the Maradonia books away and tries writing a new story with a worthy manuscript that she sends to editors and publishes legitimately. She’s obviously got drive and determination, but if the Maradonia books are all she has to offer, then she clearly lacks the talent to be a successful writer, and the way she conducts herself is already ruining her chances of ever accomplishing anything lasting and worthwhile."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,M.M. Strawberry Library & Reviews,"August 3, 2020",1.0,"(update as of August 2020) Gloria is now writing under a new author's name, Sofia Nova and doing the same shit of self-aggrandization with sockpuppets and pretentious AF videos.

The fact that this book is so terrible has nothing whatsoever with the author's age. The plot sounds fairly exciting and since you know it is someone's first novel, you know it might not be the best. No big deal, right?

This book is an example of how NOT to write. The most obvious mistake here is the atrocious grammar. Commas and ellipses are misused and abused, names are placed in quotations for no apparent reason, and it appears as if a thesaurus has been hastily used - but the words used often do not match the tone or the word they are supposed to describe.

The antagonist(s) here is the 'Evil Empire'. No, really. I'm not kidding you. Actions contradict one another so the story does not have coherent flow. Many problems are apparent just from the first chapter. There is an inordinate amount of rulers for the Evil Empire (70) all sitting at one table, though before the author had stated that Apollyon was King of the Evil Empire, but apparently he has seventy rulers. Huh? There's a lot of other lords of other realms like air and the underworld, and the story gets lost in all sorts of useless trivia like dwarves magically materializing out of thin air just to open doors.

The dialogue is very wooden, and the text is poorly formatted. I mean, we all have to start somewhere - but this is definitely not it. Nothing personal towards the author - but she really would be better off going to college and getting a degree in anything besides English."

Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,MintyRose,"January 10, 2010",1.0,"It seemed like a rebranding of c.s lewis's narnia series... Except that he has far better writing skills and more imagination with naming things, people, and plot in general. Boring."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Suzanna Tempesta,"April 10, 2013",1.0,"I found out about this book from the WriterfromNowhere on YouTube, and he reviewed it as horrible, so of course, I had to check it out for myself.
Let me first off say that I feel bad for Gloria about as much as you feel bad for an orphan...divided by ten trillion million thousand.
I understand she wanted to write a book. She just did a crap job at it. The story, just from reading about it sounds reminiscent of Narnia and Harry Potter and is littered with cheap Christian symbolism. This book sounded like something an 8 year old wrote in her spare time.
Did she even edit? Probably not? Maya and Joey are just...boring. They make Mary Sues look good. Which is saying something.

Plot

Oh God. With a capital 'G'. Gloria steals from the Bible, The Chronicles of Narnia and well, her own strange mind. It's just confusing, stereotypical, and sounds like the brain-child of a dreaming 6 year old who wants to go to Narnia. It sounds like a fanfiction, to be honest.

Characters

I swear Gloria first made Joey and Maya love interests, but then thought that would be too Sue-ish. Well, yeah, but making them siblings and in love is just weird. Sues, again and just boring.
Also, it seems every single character is mentioned when they are present.
""...Abbadon, Plouton, Aruses, Gertrude, Lorris, Ceara, Andromeda and Cassandra, Persiano and Pegany and seven other powerful fairies,"".

Grammar and Other Mechanics

Usually this doesn't have to be included, but it does here. Armed assault against ellipses, strange italics, other strange stuff...

Style

Boring. I think when she was learning to write, she took 'show don't tell' and changed it into 'tell don't show'. For God's sake, you don't have to tell every single breath one of the characters takes.

Pro's - Rivals My Immortal fanfic, hysterical to read and poke fun at.

Con's - Everything listed above, plus Gloria shamelessly self-promotes using 'psychological doctors' with names like 'Earl J.' as sock puppets who say 'with my astute knowledge, I say that ____ is right and _____ is amazing. Bull. Don't bother reading this or buying this unless you want to poke fun."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Java Joe,"April 14, 2014",1.0,"You know what's worse than a bad novel? A bad novel with a whole marketing machine behind it. No, I'm not talking about the latest from Shlockmeister Stephanie Meyer, I'm talking about Gloria Tesch and her ""Maradonia"" books.

You might have never heard of her and consider yourself lucky if you have. You have been spared the pain of knowing such a self-centered, vapid excuse for a person actually exists. If you search, especially on this site, you'll notice one thing really quickly. All the 5 star ratings she gets are from certain people or these same people have only written one review which is co-incidentally for her book(s).

The whole Maradonia series is a mishmash of poorly thought out situations, obvious setups, anachronistic technology and some of the worst dialogue you can imagine.

The story itself is rather bland not to mention cliche in the extreme. Two ordinary kids find a portal to a magical land. Here they find they're important and fulfilling a prophecy. Personally I much preferred it when C.S. Lewis wrote about Narnia. He at least was able to put some rather obvious Christian allegory into his story without being hamhanded about it.

Gloria writes with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. A few times I could almost imagine her giggling in the background shrieking ""ask me what it means!"" over and over again when some obvious symbolism crept in.

It's a shame to say that I picked this up from a box of old books by the side of the road and I still feel I was overcharged for it. That's right. I got this book for free and still feel somebody should have paid me to take it off their hands.

There is nothing redeeming about this book or the author. Avoid it at all costs."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Samuel Proulx,"January 6, 2015",2.0,"The internet hype machine indicates that this is some of the worst writing ever printed in book form. Now that it's available as an ebook, I decided to pick it up, ready to be amused. My reaction was...blah. I've come across much, much worse writing. Yes, it's silly and unoriginal. But I can name you dozens of fantasy series that are silly, badly plotted, and unoriginal. Same goes for characterization: lots of books get this wrong, and Gloria Tesch is no worse than some other self-published authors that have crossed my path. Sure, the writing is stilted, but it isn't stilted enough to be particularly amusing. In short, Gloria Tesch's awful promotional techniques, internet drama, movie and theme park delusions, and Youtube clips are all much more amusing in their badness than are her actual books."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Jay Jay,"July 12, 2012",5.0,"I've waited for this book all summer and it was definitely worth the wait. This book was so fun to read and engaging that I finished it in one day. I just could not put it down. This book was written for children but it will also appeal to older readers as well. I should know, I'm 18 years old. The descriptions of the magic world were so fun and imaginative.

This book will probably make a great movie but it will be hard to put all the enchanting descriptions into words. I loved it so much that I had to order the sequel Maradonia and the Gold of Ophir. I can't wait to read it and I hope the author continues the adventures of Maya and Joey for years to come. A fantastic book!"
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Navi,"November 25, 2011",1.0,"This book is BAD.

I mean it. BAD.

But it's one of those hilariously horrible books that, if you can get your hands on it, is worth reading. Just don't pay the price to get it, okay?

The only reason I got a chance to read it is because a friend's mother had it for bookclub or something.

Just... if you get a chance, read it. If not, read a sporking of it. It's too funny to miss out on."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Maya Zauberman,"December 31, 2012",1.0,"The only way I could retain my sanity while reading this was by reading it out loud with a friend of mine. This POS takes itself way too seriously. It thinks it is the next moral guide to help the youth of the world. It is not. Not by a mile. The characters, if one could call them that, were so one dimensional and unlikable Mary Sues. It is, to quote another reviewer for a different book, ""as if the writer took the Mary Sue test and checked all the boxes."" everything they do is presented as wise or perfect. If they have flaws, they are completely irrelevant and unhelpful to the plot. The plot was a complete rip-off of the Bible- according to various reviewers, there are some scenes completely plagiarized from The Bible.
The writing was awkward and clunky at best, downright terrible at worst. The dialogue was too theatrical to be beliavable, and the logic made no sense.
The only good thing this book offered was unintentional comedy, and fantastic sporking material."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Mikayla MacIntyre,"February 29, 2016",2.0,"I bought this book for a penny, and it was a signed copy no less. Unfortunately, it seems to not be worth even as much as that, and here's why: While I will give Ms. Tesch credit, this book made me laugh and I had a fun time reading it, it wasn't for the reasons that she was probably hoping for. This book is generally awful, with poor formatting and writing that was clearly unedited from the first draft. I would be willing to forgive that if the story was interesting, but it's not. The story itself, without giving away anything, is boring, generic, and easily predictable. And as for the main characters, Maya and Joey, they are, without a doubt, the most sociopathic, awful main characters I've ever seen that were not supposed to behave in that sense.

However, for what's it worth, it's good for a laugh or a gag gift, or even to explore the mind of a young girl with an incredibly large ego, so I'll give it two stars. I also recommend it if you're a writer, that way you can remind yourself you can always do better than this."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Adam,"February 26, 2017",5.0,The book isn't as bad as the reviews say. I really enjoyed the story even though it was made for twelve-year-olds. It's nice to relax your mind with something new and see things from another perspective. Give her a chance. 5 stars for effort.
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Dr. Gerhard,"August 8, 2012",5.0,"The new E-Book version of Maradonia and the Seven Bridges hit my brain and burned a big hole into my soul. I am pretty sure that several people might not agree with me, but I really believe the edited version with its brand new prologue of this book is World Literature. The stories of this teenager author and novelist Gloria Tesch are just overwhelming because of the simplicity and they show from their psychological proportions in the life of the siblings, Maya and Joey, and in their fight between good versus evil a far deeper substance – basically a story behind the story - and this is one of the reasons why I believe that the Maradonia Saga will certainly have a longer life line in the future than the Twilight or the Harry Potter series. But as a doctor with solid psychological background I see also other reasons: The Maradonia Saga is not just entertainment! Maradonia is a life style because it meets our longings to experience the truth of life, love and death. However, this Maradonia Life-Style is in my opinion able to help the reader better to understand life itself and his role in his own family, the nation and in the universe.
I read all six books of the Maradonia Saga and forgive me, but I believe this series can play sooner or later an important role for fans, middle readers and young adults. Again, this series is a must-read for parents, teachers, and librarians that will serve as a bridge to growth in knowledge, faith and in the understanding that there is also tremendous power in positive thinking."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Courtney Mcardle,"July 18, 2012",5.0,"Maradonia and the Seven Bridges is a very well-written book, portraying an epic battle of good vs evil between a brother and sister and many mythical, dangerous creatures. It is a story that gives good morals as well as philosophical morals, and you read on in the book, you see the brother and sister really mature in the story, which makes Maya and Joey relatable characters for children of all ages! It starts out as just a pair of outgoing, adventurous teenagers who soon encounter a conquest depicitating the powers of darkness. They must go over several tests and temptations. I give the Maradonia Saga my recommendation for anyone who wants to lose themselves in a grant sweeping epic fantasy that can stand up against the finest of the genre!"
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Morgan Corsetti,"July 12, 2012",5.0,"This is a magical story of two young teenagers who learns bravery, positive thinking, magic and friendship withheld in the land of Maradonia.
I was looking for a non-sports book for my ten year old to enjoy. Much to my delight Maradonia became the read out loud bedtime story for the past two weeks.
I must admit that I read ahead when I was going to be out of town for the night, so that I could share the story with them over the phone. I intend to purchase many for Christmas gifts.
I'm actually on the internet looking to see if there's a sequel. Beautifully written."

Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Christie Greenwood,"October 20, 2017",1.0,"It's interesting that the only positive reviews that don't delight in the 'so bad it's atrocious' hilarity of this thing come from accounts that have reviewed nada apart from Gloria Tesch's magnum opus. The book itself is very, very funny in all kinds of unintended ways: horrible grammar, weird formatting, Unnecessarily Capitalised Words, a humongous font, and so much plagiarism (Narnia and the Bible, mostly), it'll make your head spin. The worst aspects are the author's arrogance, though, and well as her (and her parents', I suppose) dishonest promotional tactics: sockpuppetry, highjacking Yahoo Answers, and blatant lies (no, she was never the youngest novelist in the world). It's fun to mock all this, but the book itself reads like (as Swankivy put it) a child's literary potty training. Now it's out there, though, and worthy of ridicule. I would be more forgiving if Tesch didn't compare herself to Stephen King and J.K. Rowling, but she does, so there."

For those of you who have read it, I encourage you (pun intended) to try to speak like the characters in this book for a day--because we all know how natural the dialogue in this book sounds. If you succeed, you get a virtual cookie...as well as a trip to the esteemed /Pool of Blood/ (cue the italics) that is just a sorry excuse to make the Mary Sue protagonists practically invincible."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,N,"April 13, 2012",,"Because I don't want to believe there could possibly be an 'published' author who is actually far worst than the likes of Alexandra Adornetto or the author of the My Immortal fanfic (okay I'm making wild exaggerations here but who cares, really?).

This I have got to see. I'm gonna read this as constant inspiration for my own works and prime example of how NOT to write a novel."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Alys Marchand,"April 27, 2014",1.0,"I've had to think for over a month about what to write about the first four books. I can't even continue reading anymore. I realize it was ostensibly written by a ten-year-old, and that some people think anything written by a kid should get a good rating by default. However, if this was aimed at an audience of kids, it would be confusing and boring. If aimed at an adult audience, it's snark-fodder and still confusing and boring. Even if you're ten, you need an audience in mind. Who would read this book and enjoy it? The very rare person, that's who.

Since the author is now an adult and refuses to put out a revised edition, we can assume that she stands by this book as written, so I will review it with the mindset that the author is an adult, not a child.

Some major problems include an extreme lack of editing, aside from the story. Punctuation, grammar, spelling, etc., could have been cleaned up by an adult, if not the author herself, to some degree. I can give a pass to an occasional error. However these mistakes shouldn't be so often that it's not far off to say they occur in every sentence.

The reliable on purple prose goes into urple. Prose properly used is poetic. Purple prose is overly flowery. Urple is just plain distracting. The entire saga opens with an over-the-top description of a sunset that is so far out there that it's easy to not realize for a beat what she's talking about. It's jarring in a way that removes you from the pages, and that's not a good way to open any book.

On the other side, when urple wasn't used, overly-cliched descriptions were. The one that made me laugh the most was mentioned by another reviewer. ""Tall and evil"" for the villain! Stephenie Meyer was snarked for describing the Volturi in a similar manner, and others have joked about how the bad guys might be standing there twirling their comical mustaches. An imposing man with a hard face that seemed to have never known more than a sneer, with a cruel glint in his eyes, gets the idea across without relying on ""tall and evil.""

As far as the story goes, it does read like bad Narnia fanfiction. A couple kids, siblings, of course, go through a portal, and the fate of that world relies on those kids. Lewis weaved a complex story with many characters we wanted to know about. Maya and Joey were whiny, and I wished Tolkien's Nazgul would swoop in, grab them, and drop them into Mt. Doom. More or less, they meandered from one disaster to the next, saved by deus ex machina. It dragged, and to be completely honest, I started reading these books in bed when I was having a hard time sleeping. Classical music relaxes me, but these books bored me to sleep.

I don't think much of this is Gloria's fault. Her parents have clearly been pushing this since she was a child. They're the ones who funded print runs, paid their friends to be editors, laid out large sums of money hiring Hollywood filming crews (most who have quit) to make a movie and film trailers. It seems that, from early childhood, the girl's parents have told her everything she does is perfect, and that she mastered the art of story-telling when she was still a child. Gloria might be shielded from any real criticism. She's been pushed into modeling and writing, and has clearly only heard praise from the very people who should have encouraged her to learn the craft instead of telling the world how they parented the world's youngest published author (she's far from the youngest) and forcing her into their mold. The Tesches are a train wreck, and unfortunately their daughter is a casualty of their delusions. If they had encouraged her education instead of living vicariously through Gloria, she would have written better books, if she herself even decided writing is what she genuinely wants to do.

Gloria, if you ever happen to read this, go back to school. Finish your basic education, and figure out what YOU want to do, not what your parents have forced you to do. It doesn't matter if they get disappointed if you don't want sexy pictures taken on beaches or if you don't want to sit at yet another book-signing signing books for the same crowd your parents hire each time, the same people who appear in all the videos. You're the one who has to live your life. If your parents will only be proud of you for turning out books that their friends/editors won't actually edit lest it make you sad to see a dot of red ink, then they're not worth it. What does Gloria enjoy doing for Gloria? As these books go in, it starts to come through that you're forcing out words instead of putting your heard into this."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,✨Emily✨(Marauders version)&#x1f4dc;&#x1fab6;,"June 2, 2021",1.0,"Just a fun thing, if u look at all of the ppl who rated this book five stars, u will see that they only have this book series on their site, no friends, and they are not following anyone. Wow. Ps. This review was better edited then this book, just an FYI"
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Laura,"July 23, 2015",1.0,"I can see how Gloria Tesch might have shown this to her parents, and how they might have been impressed that their daughter was beginning to write.
“So many pages our daughter has written, and she has only 10 years! Brimming adventure! A ‘beginning, middle, and end’!”

I can even see how the Tesches wouldn’t have wanted to immediately tell Gloria, “Hey, kid, you ripped these concepts directly off of the Bible, traditional fantasy, and. . . strangely enough, what would appear to be some kind of book of inspirational quotes about leadership. Get back to us when you’ve got something original!” Gloria Tesch would be far from the only child who wrote what is essentially fanfiction at a young age. . . her very “different” approach to “” would perhaps be something for her home-schooling parents to guide her in along the way, and some books and classes about original world-building would be a wonderful and enriching gift for a child who wrote a work like Maradonia. It could have been a “world between worlds” in the sense of bridging young Gloria from reader to writer!

However, the Margaret Fuller quote Gloria uses [unattributed] in this book is not, “Today a reader, tomorrow a writer.” . . . No, the quote is, “Today a reader, tomorrow a *leader*.” A leader of a brand, it would appear. . . because she skipped the step of improving upon her large volume of derivative moonings about unicorns and mermaids, had it self-published, and continued to single-mindedly promote it like it was a best-seller and movie-worthy, even now that she is quite old enough to know better. To be fair, I’m not sure she has a face-saving way out of the center of the pseudo-fame machine at this point, and that’s where I think that the adults in her life failed her.

On the surface, Maradonia and the Seven Bridges is a fantasy novel with a standard plot and an extremely strange way of handling wording and details. Under the surface, there’s a 21-year-old woman still cycling through a tween’s training prose. Whether this is comedy or tragedy is up to you.
As for me, I just can't believe I read the whole thing."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Linda Stover,"October 6, 2017",1.0,"Hey kids! Want to read a self-published book written by a person claiming to be the world's youngest novelist? Want to read something that sounds like it was written by a person with only a passing understanding of English? How about a book with huge plot holes, unrealistic situations, dialogue that nobody in their right mind would ever say and some of the lamest villains ever? If so then Maradonia and the Seven Bridges is for you.

It's bad. It's really bad. The basic plot is, two kids find out they're the fulfillment of a prophecy in a magical land called Maradonia and travel there to find their destiny. Pretty standard stuff. But what happens during this is something you'd expect out of bad fanfiction.

The main character of Gloria... sorry I meant Maya is such a Mary Sue that even the trope creators are telling her to tone it down. People are always telling her how beautiful and smart she is when at no time does any of that matter. And her brother Joey is the master of the sage advice that sounds really good until you think about it. When he says stuff like that I'm always reminded of the scene in ""Mystery Men"" when the Sphinx in trying to muster the team says to Mr Furious, ""until you learn to master your rage..."" to which Mr Furious responds, ""your rage will be your master? That is what you wanted to say right?"" It's like that.

There's no tension. There's no excitement. It's something happens, the kids get saved, the danger has passed. People tell Maya she's so beautiful and smart and Joey makes a quip. Rinse and repeat.

There was a movie that was made out of this and although it was never released commercially, a copy did make it's way onto the internet before Team Tesch took it down. I highly recommend anybody who's a fan of bad movies to seek it out. It's beyond terrible.

But yeah. Unless you happen to find it lying by the side of the road, give this book a pass. And even then unless you need to see how bad it is or just feel like torturing yourself, don't read it."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Kack,"April 7, 2015",1.0,"To review Maradonia and the Seven Bridges is similar to reviewing Birdemic: Shock and Terror- it has been done so compulsively and so veraciously that there is little more to be said.

That being said, we shall still dive in! Let me say that getting through this book took much longer than it should and that I gave it more attention than it deserves. With such large font, such simplistic wording and such generous spacing, this should be a short step away from a children's book that a Mama Bear uses to lull her younglings to sleep. Alas, this was not the case. Due to the inhuman sentence structure, improper use of grammar and horrific spelling, I found myself pausing compulsively to retread the content to attempt to understand it.

Let me say, that Team Tesch has committed child abuse. Gloria as a 13 year-old was bright enough and showed potential... but potential does not mean an artist has arrived. Gloria Tesch was a decent writer for being 13 years-old, but because of her parents' unwavering and unfair promotion, the POTENTIAL diamond in the rough was never given the incentive to learn and hone like every artist should. Every great artist, from Leonardo da Vinci to William Shakespeare, had to apply themselves, regardless of how fast they learned or how much talent God handed to them. We may never know what potential Gloria had."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Erik,"April 27, 2017",1.0,"This should actually be 0 Stars since Gloria Tesch's peace of crap is really that terrible.

This laughable ""book"" is one of many examples of horrible self-published books. These books are 800 pages, yet they are only 60,000 words apiece - they're written in gigantic text. The plot is unoriginal, with blatant plagiarism from various sources (including the Bible), and the writing is incredibly childish. To name just one example, the book's villainous organization is called ""The Evil Empire"" (I'm not kidding) and they have their own water park and sing Mother Earth songs. The heroes are unlikable ***holes.

What overshadows the book's ridiculous content is the behavior of Gloria Tesch herself. She has an ego even bigger than Kanye West's. She silences all criticism of her books via sock puppet accounts and lawyers - she even had YouTube videos criticizing her books taken down. She claimed there would be a movie and even a theme park her book. She also steals copyrighted fantasy art to promote her books. Worse still, she pretends that her books are popular and perpetually sold out when in fact hardly anyone's heard of her book except for her critics. Seriously, this girl has problems.

With every horribly-worded sentence, a bit of my soul burned away. This is clearly the work of a (to put it kindly) teenage idiot whose overdoting parents fed her ego by publishing this bilge. And listen, I get that ""oh but she's only 13, everyone writes terribly at that age"" but listen: there's a reason 13 year olds don't get published. And now this one was tricked into thinking she's good.

The most disturbing part: no, not the complete lack of editing, not the Christian brainwashing or the terrible grammar or the flagrant misuse of quotation marks and italics, but the fact that every single 5-star review on this damn book is by an account made for the sole purpose of leaving flattering reviews on Tesch's books. Her parents actually went and made numerous fake Goodreads accounts just so their precious empty-headed daughter could continue to delude herself into thinking she can write.

And now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go throw up."
Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Liam,"April 10, 2014",1.0,"If I would like to be entirely honest, and I will be, as I greatly enjoy tearing shitty books to pieces, The Maradonia 'Saga' is a creative writing essay taken waaaaaaaaaaaay to far. Gloria Tesch's parents had their heads so far up their asses that when they discovered their daughter could write english with a keyboard, they pooled every cent they owned into advertising and self-promoting way over the line, an amusement park? fake TV shows with people who aren't even cited probably being paid to revere the Seven bridges like a god, well I'll just go ahead and say how much of a piece of trash it is. Not to mention of course the sock-puppet accounts made to promote the book(s), every review and rating being made a glowing five star review by Gloria Tesch (seriously, read the rest of the reviews) and the low quality of the book speaks for itself, it really is impossible to put how terrible a book like this into context, just think 'definitely not the next J.K.

Maradonia and the Seven Bridges,Isabel T.,"September 17, 2017",1.0,"Ummm... wow. You'll notice that this is marked ""currently reading"". That's because I could barely make it through 20 pages without throwing it down in disgust, and this is from someone who finishes almost every book she starts. I tried to make a game of it, highlighting every typo or error made. I soon realized that that was an exhaustive process due to the sheer number of errors. It isn't just the mistakes that makes it awful. It is also extremely boring. I'm going to attempt to make it through the first 100 pages.

Pygmy,Chris,"October 12, 2009",1.0,"Begins here paragraph the first of reviewer me, goodreader Chris, upon completion great American subversive novel. ISBN: 978-0-385-52634-0. Title: Pygmy. Author: Esteemed sodomite Chuck Palahniuk. For official record, expose novel as shit of iguanadons.

Sales of novel great, fueled by author prior reputation as popculture satirist. For establish goodreader history, this reviewer previously read Choke, disliked as bite in testicle by rabid wombat , however, is willing to give chance the second to esteemed author. sourced from store of unwanted belongings for make resale, this reviewer surprised not this book forsaken shortly after release to fickle American public, along with musical genius of 3 Doors Down and Doctors of Spin. This reviewer see discount price, value equal to one monetary unit feature evil tyrant George Washington, next now, this reviewer make small parade to register, purchase novel.

Story describe efforts of special Operatives from great unnamed nation oppressed by imperialist American war machine, agents embark on righteous counter-attack Operation Havoc: infiltrate Midwest American families under guise as students of exchange, impregnate peers to create anchor babies, acquire supplies and build weapon of mass destruction, last, detonate weapon kill many Americans. Narrator Agent 67, issued name “Pygmy” by host American family, Cedar family. During assimilation process to society typical of American suburb, Agent Pygmy teased as foreigner, retaliates by demonstrating superior combat training, superior spelling prowess, recitation of wise quotations former world leaders, and rape of bully’s young puckered anus.

Now, I understand that Palahniuk was trying something different, to write a book in English, yet using the syntax of an alternate language to more truthfully narrate the story from Pygmy’s point of view, but really, does anyone want to read shit like that for 200 pages? Plus, with Pygmy being such a quick learner you’d think that maybe towards the end there would be some sort of improvement towards , but that doesn’t happen. I don’t know whether I should give Palahniuk a big pat on the back or a kick in the junk for managing to write like a cretin throughout the course of the book. It’s akin to listening to a band with absolutely no cohesiveness, no rhythm, no music sense, and a lead singer with an uncontrollable stutter and wondering if it’s the most god-awful noise on the planet or a new groundbreaking statement. So while Chuck may have gloriously displayed his large sack by gambling with this experiment, it certainly didn’t help endear me to his work, not that I suppose he cares.

So with the book barely managing to remain readable to me, it was really up to the story itself (glowingly described as “The Manchurian Candidate meets South Park – his finest novel since the generation-defining ) to win the day. This, unfortunately, didn’t happen. There were a few elements which really kept me from enjoying the story, the first was a niggling carry-over from which was also utilized in this story: the annoying habit of Pygmy alphabetically reciting the elements in times of duress, much like Victor rattled off medical conditions in the previous book. To me, this comes across as a poor way for Palahniuk to make the narrator appear clever, that may not be his intent, but that’s how I interpret it. The next bother was the deadpan delivery when introducing what I’m guessing was intended to be comedy, but Pygmy’s matter-of-fact observations didn’t work for me. Much less, with many of these referring to pop culture and brand names, it’s hard to imagine that a well-trained mole would confuse Listerine with cologne (even more so when the character is able to discern the chemical composition of most items with a mere whiff). Lastly, most of the events which occur while the agents are being indoctrinated into society were just too over-the-top to suspend my disbelief and allow the story to continue as something I should take even remotely seriously (killing a priest during a baptism in front of the entire congregation, breaking numerous arms and legs in gym class, and don’t even get me started on the school-shooting during the Model United Nations). While I have no doubt that this is just Palahniuk’s style, it doesn’t work for me. I’ve never read , but after I first saw the movie, I had to turn to my fellow-viewer and ask, “Am I really supposed to believe a bunch of thick dudes were inspired to take direction from a guy they witnessed kicking his own ass outside a bar?”

On a positive note, there are some people I actually recommend this book to, or at least I suppose they’d like it, I personally wouldn’t associate with any of the dimwits I’m attempting to describe. Anyone who considers the USA as a global bully deserving of retribution by terrorist factions for foisting its tainted culture upon the world, consuming an inordinate amount of precious resources, and for sticking its nose in foreign affairs will probably enjoy this. Pygmy’s training in his home country, which I am going to call out as Turkmenistan simply because Palahniuk pussies out from pointing the finger at any nation in particular, focuses heavily on anti-materialist rhetoric and the negative aspects of America’s global policing, and Pygmy crams these astute lessons into a filibuster while acting as the United States’ delegate in the United Nations fiasco, demanding the evil empire make reparations for basically everything since their inception, and calls for the execution of their past and present leadership. Using Pygmy’s backasswardly-written thoughts, Palahniuk spends a good deal of time attacking most of the social values and economic practices of the contemporary USA, hell, it’s so anti-American he even takes time to dis “A Horse With No Name” by the band America in passing. That’s just gratuitous. The other group that might enjoy this is anyone who hass ever fantasized about dropping a beat-down on some high school punk in a bathroom, and anally raping him and painting his prostate with your cum afterwards. Or anyone who thinks the idea of a clandestine group of adolescent foreign agents being trained to suck cock by a war-scarred old rebel fighter is pretty hot stuff. If you’re one of those enlightened folks that can sympathize with any of the sentiment expressed in this paragraph, you might want to check out.

Overall, even if the writing style hadn’t been intentionally bad, the lack of a redeeming story really makes it hard to understand why the author is still being published, even with a ‘generation-defining’ work under his belt (I cringe just thinking I’m included in that unfortunate group, even though I probably will get around to checking out at some point). Having read two books by Palahniuk, I’m completely baffled as to why he’s considered a gifted writer. I'm so thoroughly disgusted that I actually own this that I'm probably just going to give my copy to the stinky kid next door when he stops by trick-or-treating, !"
Pygmy,Sara (sarawithoutanH),"March 9, 2018",1.0,"CW: rape, violence, racism, sexism, school shooting

This review is going to have spoilers, so feel free to skip if you don’t like that.

What the literal fuck? I cannot read this for another second. This book is only 256 pages but it felt like eternity. I only have an hour left of the audiobook but I will not subject myself to this any longer. If I could give this zero stars I would.

The story centers around what I assume to be an Asian spy from a communist country. He comes to the US as a foreign exchange student and everyone refers to him as Pygmy. His actual country of origin is not revealed, but racism is present in abundance and gives you insight into how Pygmy might appear. The fact that I had to figure out what the character looks like based on racial slurs is abhorrent. The story is told in broken English, which not only makes the story hard to follow, but also adds to the whole racist atmosphere of the novel. Even the name Pygmy seems racist because the literal definition of the word is “a member of certain peoples of very short stature in equatorial Africa and parts of Southeast Asia.” Also, Pygmy is essentially a terrorist, as his main goal is to go to D.C. and set off a bomb. Harmful stereotype, much?

But don’t worry if you thought it couldn't get any worse. This book isn’t just racist, it’s also sexist. One of Pygmy’s other goals is to impregnate an American woman. Pygmy constantly looks observes women as “receptacles for seed” and there is no shortage of slang terms for women’s breasts. All of the men in the novel regard women with little to no respect. The American girls are characterized as being loose and slutty. After Pygmy saves the students from a school shooting, multiple girls come up to him, offering him sex.

There are many scenes where I think Palahniuk’s only intention was to make the reader uncomfortable. There is an anal rape scene of a bully in chapter two and also a scene where the main character removes a vibrator from his host mother’s vagina while she is unconscious. I’ve never read any other of Palahniuk’s books, but I have seen Fight Club, so it doesn’t surprise me that he is into shock value. I just thought such a revered author would have more substance. I am surprised that this book was written in 2009. This book just feels like a bunch of tired racist and sexist cliches.

After the anal rape scene, the bully comes to Pygmy begging him to love him. Apparently, the bully has been hiding his sexuality and Pygmy awakened his inner desire for gay love. (WTF???) Pygmy turns him down and this leads the bully to later bring a gun to the school and shoot his classmates. This school shooting felt like a big joke and, in 2018, it wasn’t very funny.

This just feels like a book written by a gross nihilist who wants to shock you with how cretinous he can be. I know that some authors use dark topics to prove a point, but this just feels like Palahniuk wrote haplessly with the intent of showing us how Edgy™ and Against the Grain™ he is. I understand this book is meant to be satirical, but, I’m sorry, I’m not impressed with a white cis man writing any of this.

If you’ve ever read a Palahniuk book worth your time, do let me know in the comments. I’ve heard good things about some of his other books, but I’m hesitant to pick another one up."
Pygmy,Lyn,"February 4, 2017",3.0,"""I am Palahnuik damn it!""

He may be the Vonnegut of our age. Scathing satire with all the subtelty of a sledge hammer. And a fun read, too, though the stream of consciousness pigeon English took some getting used to.

Flying panda kick! BAM POW!"
Pygmy,Kemper,"January 14, 2010",4.0,"I got so caught up at reading the mangled English that I forgot I was reading a Chuck Palahniuk book, and I had not properly mentally braced myself when the first horrible thing happens in Chapter 2. After getting that shock, it was easier to remember who I was dealing with.

This has got everything you'd expect from a Palahniuk novel. Dark humor, graphic violence, and a bunch of disturbing characters with an outlandish plot and outrageous twists.

This story of a spy trained since childhood by an unnamed facist government posing as an exchange student allows Palahniuk to engage in his usual bashing of American consumer culture, but flashbacks to Pygmy's upbringing and training are used to illustrate that there are worse things in the world.

What sets this apart from his other books is the abuse of the English language in the hands of Pygmy. It's oddly addictive to read and hilarious. For example, here's Pygmy at Junior Swing Choir:

""For official record, currrent now, ape mimic joyous facial expression fellow student during bellow propaganda lyrics. All lauding agrarian United States deemed Oklahoma, primitive environment employing equine labor for drag wheeled conveyance despoiled with superfluous decrotive fringe.""

If you find that funny, you'll probably like the book."
Pygmy,Christy Stewart,"April 30, 2010",1.0,I'll give it another chance as soon as they translate it into English.
Pygmy,Imogen,"February 19, 2009",2.0,"I'm giving this two stars because it's better than Snuff, but only because it's better than Snuff. Like, in hope that ol' Chuck's on an upswing?

Okay so. Did you see that M Night Shyamalan movie The Village? If you're like me, five minutes into that movie you were like, 'clearly these puritanical folks are modern-day back-to-olden-times people! Otherwise why would a director like Mr Shyamalan, who normally pays so much attention to details and specifics, have them all talking like people in the oughties?' And then in the end you felt very smart for having such brilliant insights when you were proved right.

My point is not that I am a brilliant, insightful genius. My point is that, if you are going to have people talk a specific, idiosyncratic way, there had better be a goddam reason for it, y'know? The whole hook of this book is, oh hey, this is fragmented English because English isn't the narrator's first language! Which is a legitimate conceit, except that when the narrator is someone who's mastered the periodic table of elements by the time he's four, there had better be a goddam reason that he can barely grasp another language's syntax. And also, while we're at it, if the book is told in the form of reports back to his home country, why the fuck is he reporting in this language he sucks at? It just doesn't hold up.

Oh, wait, no it holds up in the context of xenophobia!

Which is complicated, right, because here is what the book is about: America is full of jerks (a thesis I'd agree with) and other countries don't always like it (a thesis I'd agree with) and sometimes people from other countries do something about it via terrorism (true). This is all fine fodder for a novel, for sure. Let's even make it science fiction, and instead of having the terrorist be from a real country America has declared war on, let's have him be from a made-up, futuristic coalition of countries- that might cut down on the potential for real-world political insight or commentary, but hey, it's fiction, Chuck can do what he wants. Plus they were made-up countries in , weren't they? Oceania was, anyway. And Brave New World worked.

That is a good idea for a book! So Chuck, why did you have to waste it on jokes about vibrators and how foreigners can't speak English right? Oh, because you're Chuck Palahniuk and you pander to an audience of manly, bro-ey duders (and me, I guess) who want titillation, not insight. Who want you to play with but ultimately reinforce their prejudices and snappy judgments.

Of course this is old news to everyone except me. Chuck Palahniuk's reputation is: famous dunderhead, churning out stupid bullshit. I think it's more complicated than that, though! Dude has a giant brain, comes up with good ideas- brutal criticism of America from an oppressed outsider's perspective!- he just always then completely blows them with jokes about that murderous vibrator, or fucking your sister or something. (Whereas when he just lets his brain goes and gets less, like, sensationalistic- see or even , although I guess Invisible Monsters was pretty ridiculous- he can be pretty amazing.) When you strip away the vaguely xenophobic conceit, Pygmy is just a bunch of goddam predictably outrageous Chuck Palahniuk hijinx: ""Oh, Pygmy thought that he could bake the cake in half the time if he turned the heat twice as high! Oh, Pygmy ate all the chocolates!"" Whatever.

It's a shame. I want better from you, Chuck! At this point, I almost wish you hadn't written , because Rant was absolutely brilliant and is one of my favorite books and if I'd never read it I certainly wouldn't keep reading this shit."
Pygmy,Sara,"July 19, 2009",5.0,"If your reading level and vocabulary aren't excellent, you don't have a good grasp of 40's-80's Communist history, and your tolerance for extreme sexual weirdness isn't pretty high, don't read this book. All of Palahniuk's books are a little... extreme, but this one has reached a whole new level of weird.
As a quick check of the synopsis should tell you, Pygmy is an exchange student from an unnamed Communist country. His story is told in a series of mangled-English dispatches back to his masters. He and a group of other kid supersoldiers have been sent to the Bible belt to engineer the downfall of America through Project Havoc.
Pygmy's problem is that, though he spouts Communist dogma (including quotes from Mao and Hitler that should curdle your blood), the essential bipolar humanity of the people around him seeps into his psyche. Within his first couple of days in America, he has attacked (this scene is violent and contains unacceptable sexuality) a bully who has been terrorizing Pygmy's exchange brother.
Pygmy regularly performs acts of public bravery, and his views of American cultural traditions are both hilarious and deeply troubling. His visits to WalMart (and his treatment of the elderly female greeter, who sees through him and reacts in kind) are crushingly honest, and also terrifying. Pygmy goes on a trip to WalMart to purchase bomb-making supplies that should make you go and search your kids' closets RIGHT NOW.
I have trouble ""recommending"" Pygmy to anyone. If, like me, you read to give your brain a workout, to feel the pathways in your brain change, to feel and think things to which you do not ordinarily have access, and to take a vacation from yourself, then you might be interested in Pygmy. If you read purely for escape and expect a slight depression in the middle of a story, then a soaring, satisfying finish, choose another book."
Pygmy,Mau,"January 29, 2011",5.0,"Pygmy is focused on the experiences of Agent Number 67, a 13-year old secret agent from an unnamed totalitarian state. Agent Number 67 along with 11 other young men and women take a journey to America disguised as foreign exchange students with the ultimate goal of executing a terrorist attack named Operation Havoc upon the American society.

When I was watching Angelina Jolie's movie, SALT, I couldn't help but think of this vintage Palahniuk novel. It left me wondering if the people who wrote Salt's screenplay have used this novel as a pattern. Although Pygmy and the movie's stories have great disparities, you can not deny that there are obvious common grounds as well.

At first, I was a bit disappointed when I read the first few lines from the book. It was written in ""Broken English"" or as other readers call it ""Pygmy English"". I browsed through the other pages only to have a confirmation that the whole book was indeed written in the same manner... I thought to myself, ""What was Palahniuk thinking?!""...with that and my insatiable curiosity, I pushed to give it a try... a few hours later, I was half way through it.
Every word was intoxicating! There is a common misconception that if a person can not communicate well in English, he is as dumb as a cardboard. But in Pygmy, this way of thinking is greatly challenged and was proven wrong countless of times.

Chuck chose the right writing style for Pygmy. It gives the readers a genuine feel of the narrator's point of view. Not to mention that Agent Number 67 is such an innocently witty and funny character. The novel gives the point of view of the ""other guys""... the ""bad guys"" branded by the society. Because of Agent Number 67's musings, you learn to sympathize with him and his group. The readers will also see how very different sets of people could have so much in common.
(just read the book and find out for yourself. I don't want to spoil anyone with my ranting ;p)

Chuck Palahniuk berated the ridiculous lifestyle most people have through the eyes of this new comer. There is a subtle juxtaposition that speaks so much about the differences between the totalitarian culture where the Agents grew up in and the lifestyle practiced by the majority. Through the eyes of Agent Number 67, Chuck once again attacked consumerism, pop culture, racism, the educational system, religion, sexuality, familial living and much MUCH more. It is so refreshing to read all of it.

I think this novel is a wake up call in disguise care of Mr. Palahniuk's genius mind.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Not only because of its ""entertainment factor"" but mainly because of the messages and moral lessons beyond every ""Dispatch"". You can actually learn morality from a seemingly dark and flawed character just like the ones in Pygmy better than if you read the generic tales of heroes and heroines.

This book is a challenge! Both intellectually and spiritually!
I recommend it to those who are craving on deviating from the ""sometimes annoyingly boring"" norms of the literary world."
Pygmy,La Petite Américaine,"May 20, 2010",,"Honestly, what the FUCK?

I wonder how much money Palahniuk made on sales of this piece of shit from fools like me who wanted to give the author one more chance.

Behold, one sentence (just pages after the ass-rape scene in mangled English in the Wal-Mart bathroom): ""Here worship shrine, all male neck must bind around with knotted banner, silk banner knotted at windpipe so dangle two long strands down chest to waistband trouser."" I get that the main chartacter is supposed to be a Chinese exchange student... Given that I teach ESL students, I'm also pretty sure the main character could just look up ""tie"" in the dictionary instead of having this long-winded, confusing mess of words.

Yeah, I can't take 200 pages of this.

I want my money back."
Pygmy,F,"June 24, 2019",4.0,This was a mission to read. Deciphering every sentence was a bit of a pain but it was such an unusual book and you did get used to it during the better chapters.
Pygmy,David Barbee,"June 1, 2010",5.0,"I really liked Pygmy. It’s Palahnuik’s brand of demented satire, only this time it’s aimed at traditional American ideologies. Here, a group of youngsters from a far off communist state are sent to America as exchange students. It doesn’t matter what country they’re from, just that their native land is the pinnacle of everything America isn’t. The kids are drones that have been conditioned almost since birth to carry out the will of their hyper-socialist state. Basically, they’re everything right-wing America is afraid of.

There’s plenty of humor in pre-pubescent communist killing machines infiltrating Middle America and plotting to destroy it. Scenes of the ultra-left country that Pygmy comes from show the flaws of that system, but so-called “mainstream” America is what’s on stage here. Through Pygmy’s eyes we see everything bad about ourselves. Ultra-consumerism, over-indulgence, religious corruption, greed, corporate culture, social gossip, and dysfunctional family dynamics are all on display. In other words, the traditional American ideal is a sham, and Pygmy provides the perspective to see it.

Iconic American rituals are seen on Pygmy’s journey. We see a school dance, a church baptism, trips to Wal-Mart, and a science fair. There’s even a mock U.N. meeting performed by the students that’s particularly twisted. These scenes along with flashbacks to Pygmy’s homeland show that both right and left-leaning systems are flawed and wrong. One is stern and cruel while the other is hypocritical and corrupt. And when these polar opposite cultures interact, they never seem to fully understand one another. The miscommunication and faux pas are funny, and I thought they served to shed more light on the schism of old politics (and how they’re carried on to this day).

And all that isn’t even taking into consideration Palahnuik’s style in Pygmy. He’s written the entire thing in broken English, the way a boy like Pygmy would say things. Some may find it hard to follow, but I didn’t. Mixed in is the usual wordplay you can expect from Palahnuik. He’s taken careful steps to weave lots of thematic phrases into the language, like references to breasts, martial arts, the periodic table, and quotes from various revolutionaries/madmen from the 20th century. The character of Pygmy always finds interesting ways to talk about his situation and the people around him. That character along with the political imagery made this book very entertaining."
Pygmy,Nicholas Karpuk,"September 23, 2016",1.0,"""Pygmy"" is not a good book. Unlike some of his other works, I'm not even going to praise him for experimentation, because what he did doesn't feel like all that much of a risk.

You will not find a review of this book that does not address the prose. If you haven't already read the book or an excerpt, please do so before continuing this review.... go ahead, I'll wait.......alright, now we're on the same page on the ridiculous way this is written. It's hard to adapt to because it doesn't feel like convincing English as a Second Language writing, it feels like normal Palahniuk prose with random words cut out. It's not a consistent style like ""A Clockwork Orange"" that you can adapt to, it's just clipped Palahniuk.

For a guy who seems to flaunt his research it always amazes me the areas where he tends to get lazy in some books. ""Choke"" didn't understand choking, ""Snuff"" was scoffed at by most journalist working in the porn industry, and ""Haunted"" was almost insultingly cartoonish all around. The lack of realism or even acknowledgement of real Chinese culture makes all the flashbacks look like Cold War leftovers from ""The Manchurian Candidate"".

Most of the characters in ""Pygmy"" come off as the sort of suburban cliches that ran out of cultural relevance sometime in the mid-80's. Housewives addicted to pills, out of control teenagers, Wal-Mart criticism, it's all glib, off-the-rack social commentary and paper-thin characterizations throughout.

It's one thing to have to parse through challenging text, but finding out the story beneath lacks almost any depth is the gravest insult."
Pygmy,Baba,"June 28, 2021",4.0,"This is the sort of book I expected from Chuck Palahniuk after Invisible Monsters and Choke - one that is darkly funny, but also pushing boundaries both in content and language.

Pygmy is the nickname of a 13 year old 'exchange student' who in reality is a secret agent working with other children to land a huge terrorist blow on America. The story is told in dispatches to his superiors in a very literal non-emotive way. The book looks at, and pokes fun at the American way of life, modern spy craft and also at the way we treat children in the West. This is not a book for those that can be triggered, as this is packed with triggering themes and issues, but nevertheless, this is yet another ground breaking piece of work by Chuck! 8 out of 12."
Pygmy,Adam McDonald,"June 13, 2010",4.0,"CLASSIC Chuck! Hard to read (literally, hard to read in the way it was written), gross, yet making great points about consumerism and how it has infected the American Way. Trust me here, you won't like it at first. It takes at LEAST 20 pages to get into the dialect it's written in (if you've read Trainspotting, you'll understand what I'm talking about) and even after that, there were times I had to re-read the same paragraph a few times to get what was going on.

Chuck presents an anti-hero you really do hate at first, until we see why the character is the way he is, and then you feel pity for him, until he does something else fucked up!

Chuck surprised me with the ending, and I won't give it away, other than to say it was different and not nearly as nihilistic as his other books. I would almost dare to say he's gone soft if not for the fact that I read his newer book, Tell-All, before this one.

Short book, but not a 'fast' read, due to the way he wrote it, but highly recommended! You'll never be able to think of cliched martial arts moves again! Punching Panda THRUST!"
Pygmy,Mallory,"May 14, 2009",4.0,"Finally, I got around to reading and reviewing a recent book. Feels good to be with the times. Though I have to admit that I wouldn’t have gone anywhere near the new releases table if I hadn’t been anxiously anticipating this book for the past year. Ol’ Chuck is one of the few authors whose entire bibliography I’ve taken the time to read. He has rarely disappointed me. I was nervous about this novel, because his previous novel Snuff was one of those rare disappointments. Fortunately, Pygmy was mostly satisfying. I’m glad that I picked it up right away.

is told by a boy raised in an unnamed totalitarian state, conditioned to hate capitalism and everything else American, and trained as an elite operative in a secret plot to wreak havoc upon the US. Masquerading as a foreign exchange student, Pygmy and his fellow operatives work together to implement Operation Havoc. What follows is an exaggerated commentary on American culture that is by turns hilarious, sickening, and sobering.

I was initially a little turned off of this book by the language. It reads like it was written by a person who has memorized the English dictionary, but who has had no instruction in English grammar. It took a little while to get used to. Here’s an example:



Yes, the entire book is written like that. There were a lot of paragraphs I had to go back and re-read, and that was a little bit frustrating. But after the first couple chapters, the narrator’s dialect is more familiar, and it’s a little easier to get through.

It’s easy to love our misguided narrator, Pygmy. Despite his anti-American, no-mercy training, he has a soft heart. He also has a rather dark sense of humor. He’s not a robot terrorist. He’s very human.

This novel says a lot about the absurdity of American habits and customs, but it says an equal amount about the absurdity of anti-American factions who believe that we’re the devil. Both sides are comically exaggerated, but there is a biting tang of truth contained within. It’s not an anti-American novel (though it seems like a lot of readers have been disappointed by that). It skirts being actual social commentary, and ends up being…well…just a novel. And I am happy with that. If I want blistering social commentary, I’ll pick up the opinion page of my local paper.

It took me until the very end (like, seriously, the very last page) to figure out if I liked or not. I couldn’t tell how Palahniuk would choose to end things, and it almost seemed like it was a snap decision on his part. I won’t say how it ends, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there was an alternate final page floating around in Chuck’s personal notes. Up until that point, it seemed like things could go either way. I was satisfied with the ending, though, and it swung my Enjoy-O-Meter slightly into the Enjoyment zone.

I do think that falls short of the high bar set by some of Palahniuk’s earlier work. I think he would have a hard time topping or . While the broken English format was amusing, it was unnecessary and took away from the story. That was my main complaint. But wasn’t bad, and I’m not sorry I picked it up. Couldn’t say the same for ."
Pygmy,christa,"May 4, 2009",4.0,"Do I dare say that Chuck Palahniuk is back? I mean, not quite ""Fight Club"" back, or ""Choke"" back. But at least ""Diary"" back, and that was the novel that got me to join Team Palahniuk in the first place, so it's a start. Especially after the grueling, repetitious, obsessive-compulsive, list-of-porn-movie-titles disaster that was ""Snuff"" [which I ranked among the Top 3 worst novels I read in 2008:].

""Pygmy"" is fantastic social sattire: Portrait of suburban Americana, through the lens of a foreign exchange student, sent here with a teen-aged posse of other foreign exchange students to perform the opaque ""Operation Havoc."" Pygmy settles in with a typical American family: chicken-faced mom, Viagra-breath dad, pig dog brother and cat-like sister. They welcome his visit with the gift of a too-large Jesus T'shirt, a promise to fatten him up, and a grand claim:

""We'll make an American out of you, or swear to our Lord almighty God, we're gonna die trying.""

A few minutes later, Pygmy is raping the school bully in the ""spa"" [read: men's bathroom] at Wal-Mart.

The story is told in 36 dispatches that range from the progression of ""Operation Havoc"" within the scope of, say, church, junior swing choir, high school dances, or just hanging out with cat-sister as she solder's her science fair project [actually, a vibrator that has an alarm and the ability to play music:].

Pygmy goes from maligned freak show, to hometown hero when he kills a school shooter at a Model United Nations event in the school gym. He becomes the first-pick for dodgeball in gym class, and a science fair wizard. And when he is attacked by his fellow operatives, who resent his public profile, the high school girls think the attack is an elaborate collection of new dance moves and make a protective circle around him.

Pygmy occasionally includes, for official record, how he came to be this young terrorist. A process that included getting 100 percent on a test, being told his family was dead, learning American slang, and learning combat techniques such as ""flying giant stork death kick."" Some of these maneuvers are illustrated on the back of the book by faceless, red terrorists, in a way that is reminiscent of yoga manuals from the mid-1980s.

The most impressive thing is that this story is told in a language that Palahniuk seemingly invented. Stilted, literal, anti-intuitive collections of nouns and verbs and adjectives. These are sometimes confusing, but always worth the effort of decoding. [The price of decoding is that you may find yourself talking to yourself in this language whenever you set the book aside.:]

""For official record, have not yet violated secure entry host sister vagina. More easy this agent able violate secure American national border.""

I can't think of another writer who could make this novel work, the consistency of the stilted language alone would be exhausting. But I also can't think of another writer who would try."
Pygmy,Samantha,"July 25, 2017",1.0,"I just started this book yesterday, and I can already tell that I'm going to despise it. The broken English is absolutely horrible. I read for pleasure, not to spend ten minutes a page trying to figure out what the hell is being said and trying to follow along.

Further review to come once I've finished it. Providing that actually /do/ finish it.

(Update)

I could not finish this book, and I do NOT just put books down. It annoyed me so badly that I closed it and returned it to the library before it angered me further. SO disappointed in you, Palahniuk."
Pygmy,Zuky the BookBum,"August 30, 2016",,I legit read 50 pages of this and gave up. I'm not wasting my time on this shit. I don't want to have decipher every fucking sentence in the entire fucking book. No.
Pygmy,Jeremy,"May 25, 2009",3.0,"Let my biases ring clear: I typically love Chuck Palahniuk. No single author has influenced my love of reading and writing more than Chuck has over his career.

""Pygmy"", as the book jacket says, is a romance and a comedy (satire would be closer to the truth). It is by far the most obviously humorous of his books (the running joke about Colonel Sanders made me chuckle several times). It's at once a biting send-up of American values (the observations about public education were absolutely priceless) as well as a well-balanced satire of totalitarian socialist states. In the end we find out that Americans are not so much actively evil as just dumb and unaware. It's an interesting conceit to see the world through the eyes of a narrator you initially loathe but then come to understand and even pity. That alone completely reversed my early condemnation of the book as trite, unimaginative drivel. In Chuck's hands this book works and I don't think anyone else could do it so well.

That being said, I saw the ending coming a mile away. But I don't see how I couldn't have.

Pygmy isn't the best thing he's written or the worst. I feel like he made similar points that resonated with me much more in Fight Club and Survivor. And after the early promise of Choke, Lullaby and Diary it seems he's drifted into a strange period (even by Palahniuk standards) and I'm not sure it's totally for the best. For example, I have very little desire to read ""Snuff"", though I probably will just because it's Chuck.

I guess there's a reason you don't review books based on the first thirty pages. Probably not the book to pick up if you've never read Chuck before. It's difficult to build momentum, given the broken English of the narrator. As usual, Chuck puts in an early shock and, as per my early thoughts on the book (below) it comes off as sort of hackish and attention-seeking. If you give up after thirty pages you'll probably feel about the same as I did at first, but press on and you might be surprised at how much the book redeems itself and its narrator.

These are some initial thoughts on the book: So far this resembles something a talented high school student might turn in for a creative writing assignment simply to freak out the instructor.

More initial thoughts: Less than twenty pages in and there's already been blood, crap and semen as well as an anal rape. The gross-outs are starting to wear thin and even become, gasp, predictable in his hands. It's like he's trying oh so hard to offend me, again like a teenager."
Pygmy,Amy Wong,"September 24, 2020",3.0,"TW: rape, sexual assault, racial slurs, violence

Obviously from the trigger warnings this is a highly uncomfortable book. I have not read Palahniuk's other books yet however I knew to expect dark humor and controversial writing. That doesn't mean I was ready or that I won't feel uncomfortable because I very much did. I should and do recognize that Pygmy (the word and everything the character represented) is alot directed at me but I'm still mulling it over because this is satire. That doesn't mean satire can't be racist but it's a tool to send a message and in this message, this whole book, Palahniuk kind of went at everyone in that I think he was portraying an extreme reflection of the world today. Any person alive can find something that is not ok to them in here. Pygmy is a terrorist with an outrageous mission, you can fully see the grooming done to him from his country but everything he observes about America, it's not wrong either. Palahniuk honestly portrayed every side. The family that took in Pygmy? They were hella racist. When they publicly announced adopting Pygmy they called him a filthy orphan. The daughter is the average wholly ignorant teen in America. This isn't to say, the racism to Asians is ok because he was discriminating everyone, if you're offended that's still valid. Pygmy, is probably what Trump and his people view of the Chinese right now. So I'm uncomfortable, but is this terrible as a story or book? I'm not so sure. And I can't imagine this was easy to write either."
Pygmy,Shovelmonkey1,"October 2, 2013",1.0,If you came here looking for the next Fight Club then walk away now.
Pygmy,Sentimental Surrealist,"January 28, 2015",1.0,"The Vapidity Wars: 1,188 Words and Running

This was originally a long rant about not just Palahniuk but also Bret Easton Ellis, Rick Moody, and Jonathan Franzen, who I feel have problems similar to Palahniuk's, although I'd take Moody and Franzen over Palahniuk and Ellis. I saved the whole rant in Word and plan to work it into a much more elaborate and less Palahniuk-focused essay, because while I really wanted to publish the whole thing here, this review is long enough even without the outside authors.

The basic idea of this book: young terrorist crashes into America as a mole, discovers American teenagers are disgustingly vapid, does some other shit, a parade happens, dildos, child rape as an object of hilarious uproariousness, childish cynicism, &c., &c., everybody laughs and learns absolutely nothing (butthat'sthepointyouguys) and comes home and concludes that they were just had. Whaaaaaaat a crock of shit. Now get ready for my signature literary analysis weenieism. Try your best not to beat me up and take my lunch money and break my glasses. My glasses look quite modern, I'll have you know.

I guess the slippery thing about Palahniuk is that what he wants to do looks decently high-concept pre-analysis. Palahniuk's whole routine is built around this famous sense of ""well sure, my books are vapid, my characters are empty spiteful petty people with an absurd sense of entitlement and no sense of proportion, but that's only because your average American is the EXACT SAME WAY. If my books suck, what you should really be concerned about is the fact that you suck."" I mean, surely it's at least a little sophisticated to blast a reader's expectations right back in their face, isn't it? To write in anticipation of receiving a certain reaction, and not just that but to write an argument for the reaction into your text, isn't there some sort of art or whatever in that? I probably would've made that argument two years ago, although I wouldn't have worded it quite that way, but I certainly remember having thoughts along those lines, i.e. ""this bit of stupidity is actually brilliant social commentary, wotta genius, etc., etc."" And so imagine my excitement when I, in full thrall of what I perceived as Palahniuk's powers, picked up his satire on the War on Terror! No way to lose, right? Erm, not exactly. We can run these circles of ""it's vapid because we're vapid"" all the livelong day, but all Pygmy does is reveal just how limited Palahniuk's abilities as a novelist really are, because to my way of seeing things, vapidity with an artistic agenda behind it is still fucking vapidity, and Pygmy fails to really say anything we don't already know about this War.

Which means that Palahniuk just plain isn't as smart as he thinks he is. Yes, he's trying to be smart and has a distinctive artistic agenda; what this man does is, in its own weird way, art, or at least closer to ""art"" than it is ""entertainment,"" but it isn't good art. I can sometimes find the exaggerated grotesqueness of Palahniuk's humor entertaining - I'll admit I still get a few chuckles off of Choke's more absurd sexual gags, because my sense of humor pretty much stopped developing when I hit twelve - and if he was comfortable with being just this dark humorist who just told these fucked-up stories about fucked-up people, I'll admit: a lot of his books would probably sit safely in my three to four star range. BUT, but but but, Palahniuk so frequently references being influenced by writers like DeLillo and Wallace and Hempell, whose work is not only art but fucking good art (I mean, I praise the first two authors to high heaven on a daily basis, so I'll change it up and ask: have you read Hempell? The novella at the heart of is a reminder of why I'm alive) and therefore probably sees himself as an inheritor of their legacy, isn't supposed to be ""just"" a funny author or ""just"" a guy whose books you read and have a good laugh at and forget about until the next one comes out, like that Christopher Moore guy who I see all over the place these days. Except we're supposed to see him as an important prophet of the Vapid Age.

This is all a very long-winded and essayistic that way of saying that Chuck Palahniuk isn't saying anything about the War on Terror that an angry teenager couldn't tell you, i.e. yes okay the Islamic terrorists are regularly doing unacceptable things but I mean look at US idiots! I feel this is in a way true, that both sides of the War on Terror debate are wrong, but here's the deal: the specific wrongdoings that Palahniuk points out within this book just ain't that daring and smack to me of intellectual subterfuge. ""America really is this morally bankrupt nation because our children are running wild in the street with their sex and their drugs and their loud music, a ha ha ha ha I've got you all beat"" just isn't a patch on, for instance, ""America really is this morally bankrupt nation because we've engineered and instigated two centuries of economic exploitation."" And for all he talks about how this stuff is supposed to suck, look how proud he seems of the orgy scenes Pygmy reports on! Look how much sickening writhing detail he goes into with his report on this sex and drugs-type insanity! Which leads me to believe that the ""it sucks because we suck"" thing that people put around Palahniuk is a subterfuge in and of itself, that he might to some degree actually see this ""deliberately inane"" material of his as brilliant and insightful and that the deliberate inanity is an after-the-fact justification tacked on by his more rabid fans which Palahniuk sure isn't doing much to discourage.

But you don't get to do that. That's the bottom line of this review. You don't get to say ""well, you think my commentary on the War on Terror is stupid? Look at the War on Terror itself, it's pretty dumb."" Because then you yourself get stuck in your own ridiculous labyrinth of vapidity, you yourself end up the butt of your own clever-clever jokes, you yourself look just as vapid as the vapid people and mindsets you've set out to criticize, and maybe other readers will give this guy points because it's ambiguous as to whether or not he chose the vapidity for himself, but I for one do not. Yes, setting out to play both sides of an issue and make it unclear as to where you stand, like Pynchon does with irony and paranoia, is interesting in theory, but I have my limits, and when it comes to the Vapidity Wars, you're either vapid and trying to pretend you're not, or you're no better than the ""get-a-load-of-this-guy cam"" from Wayne's World, which means you may be pretty smart but you're also spiteful and petty, so either way you're not in a good position. Either way, you lose."
Pygmy,David,"December 5, 2009",1.0,"One of the good things about reading for pleasure (instead of, say, reading for school or because someone has a gun to your head and says “read it or die!”) is that when I don’t like something, I can put it down without finishing it.
Thus ends my experience with the second Chuck Palahniuk book to disappoint me(the last one being Snuff). I’m sure this book is brilliant on some level, but after 2 chapters of this 1st person perspective story told in some kind of broken Pidgin English, about a terrorist sleeper embedded with an American family in some terrorist plot, I’m just getting a headache. Plus I’m troubled with this thought: why did Palahniuk decide to tell the story this way--why would Pygmy be reporting back to his people in broken English and not his own language? I’m sure it’s all part of the satire of American culture and this is so unlike me to crap on something without even getting through it, but it is this stylistic decision that has turned me off from trying to get through the rest of it.
Chuck, Chuck…you’re killing me! Snuff was the first book of yours I ever put down and said “This book sucks.” (I just didn’t like the premise and tried to stick with it but found that I couldn’t--this is what unlikable characters and unlikable situations do for me.) But I didn’t feel the need to pan it. But now it’s two in a row, and I’m starting to worry that either I’m not cool enough to get it, or maybe you’re just not the writer I thought you were. While I’m sure this is clever and amusing and has the elements that made Fight Club and Choke and Survivor so damn good, I am not going to stick around to find out. I am so sorry, you have no idea."
Pygmy,Kriti,"June 6, 2012",1.0,"I tried really hard to like this book, but I could not bring myself to give more than a half smile every now and then. I have to comment on the prose. It makes the reading incredibly difficult. Usually, when the writing is strange (A Clockwork Orange) it’s consistent and one gets used to it after a while. However, with Pygmy I felt that fluid reading of the book was hindered by the writing and I was struggling to understand passages. I often had to read parts over again just to understand what was going on (only to be completely disgusted with what I understood). Despite the attempt to make the narration broken and mind-on-paper-absence-of-any-proper-grammar, it came across as forced and I have to commend Palahniuk for writing like that for 200 pages but it was really awful for me as a reader. After getting past the crazy writing, I found the plot to be lacking and vapid. It had so much potential-foreign kids brought up to hate America and trained to bring its destruction-but Palahniuk failed to move it along. His attempt to be crude but insightful about the corrupt American middle class was-if I’m being frank- stupid and honestly insulting. Oooo, promiscuous middle school girls and corrupt pastors, wow congrats you’re so revolutionary. Honestly, I expected much better. I’m disappointed in Palahniuk and this falls VERY short from the high expectations I had after reading Fight Club. Don’t waste your time on this book."

So... Ummmm...
Everyone probably knows that I love Chuck Palahniuk. It pains me to give this book such a low rating, but, dammit, it's not good.
has some good elements but overall it just falls apart. It's a satire and an attack on American culture. The writing stile is unique (why I love Palahniuk - he's not afraid to experiment) but it's also pretty unreadable. I tried reading it, then switched to audio book because I had to reread every page.
It's really hard to review this book because my brain has been turned to mush and I just can't make a coherent thought. What I can say - this is by far the worst Chuck Palahniuk book I've read.

Pygmy,Kim,"July 31, 2012",1.0,"I had completely forgotten about this book until I found it while packing up all my books yesterday. A couple years ago I was put on to Palahniuk's books and enjoyed Fight Club, Snuff and Choke. Then I heard he had a new book out and thought I'd give it a try.

What a waste of money. The writing style was horrible, I just couldn't get into it at all. I gave up after a few chapters and will not ever pick it up again. It turned me off Palahniuk to the point that I've never read another of his books."
Pygmy,Ashley Daviau,"December 31, 2017",2.0,"This book was such a huge disappointment for me. I adore Chuck Palahniuk and his wonderfully twisted stories but this one was just not for me. From the very beginning it failed to capture my interest and I really struggled to keep with it until the end.

I think the main reason I struggled with it so much is the way it’s written. It’s done in such a broken English that sometimes I had absolutely no clue what was going on and would have to reread a page multiple times to make sense of it. Not really my idea of an enjoyable read.

The idea of the story was interesting but the execution just fell flat for me. I’m sure it would have been infinitely better if it had just been written normally and didn’t hurt my brain to read."

Pygmy,EpidermaS,"November 11, 2022",2.0,"Bardzo oryginalna książka. Wszystko jest tu nieszablonowe - zaczynając od fabuły, a na stylu narratora kończąc. Czy to dobrze? I tak, i nie.

Próby zrozumienia tego, co chce nam przekazać tytułowy Pigmej, bywały bardzo trudne. Nie da się przyswajać tej historii ""na lajcie"". Język wypowiedzi zindoktrynowanego nastolatka jest niezwykle formalny, niemalże techniczny. Zdecydowanie niekomfortowo czyta się m.in. o scenach gwałtu opisywanych takim stylem. Wprawdzie wówczas szokują jeszcze bardziej, bo są przedstawiane niemal beznamiętnie, ale ja jestem na nie.

Generalnie książka ukazuje Amerykę w sposób niezwykle groteskowy. Konsumpcjonizm, fałszywa poprawność polityczna, rozpasanie seksualne są tu podkręcone na maksa. Z drugiej jednak strony tajni agenci wywiadu również przerażają, więc miałam odczucie, że Palahniuk nie opowiada się za żadną ze stron.

As usual I can't say a thing about symbolism or deeper meanings or social critique, although the latter is all over the place, coming out from the hilarious mouth of pygmy, a socialist spy embedded in a shockingly weird normal American family. For an ultra intelligent, highly trained agent, pygmy is often gullible, also his diary is written in a strange English all his own. I loved this own language, despite having to read things over quite often to make sense of pygmy's narrative, and refrained of trying to make sense of how he couldn't learn correct English despite competing and winning a spelling bee among various other complicated spy skills.
I've always loved made up languages ever since I read A Clockwork Orange,and here it makes the book twice as hilarious.

Pygmy,Jonathan,"May 12, 2021",4.0,"Palahniuk has to be one of the strangest writers around. I don't even know what to say about this book, other than it is profane, violent, X-rated, funny, crazy, indescribable. Told in a fractured English dialog (so well narrated by Paul Michael Garcia!), it tells the story of Agent 67 from an unnamed authoritarian regime, slipped into the Midwest as an exchange student, but indoctrinated against the United States as an evil empire and with his fellow exchange students planning a huge terrorist strike.

Pygmy offers up crazy interpretations of Midwestern evangelical life (well, maybe not so crazy!) and describes his indoctrination into his belief system and how the evil Western empire of the United States needs to be toppled. But he does it in an incredibly naive and open eyed way, where you just have to laugh so many times. He gets himself into strange predicaments and ends up becoming a hero, much to his discomfort.

Much like the other Palahniuk book I read, , it is the product of an unbelievably febrile imagination and you just never know which bizarre situation the narrator will take you to next, one that can either make you gasp or laugh or usually both. I still don't know what to make of it!"
Pygmy,Robyn,"May 27, 2011",1.0,"I never thought that when I was considering ""Worst books I have ever read"", something by Chuck Palahniuk would be on the list, but here we are; One Star.

I'm not even sure I know where to start with this. Listen, I've read books with messed up prose before; Illuminatus and A Clockwork Orange are easily in my top five favorite books of all time. But this is largely because I managed to fall into the rhythm of those books, and after the first few baffling chapters, was able to read them with fluidity. Heck, I was thinking in Nadsat for like, a week after reading ACO.

That sort of flow just never happened here. The entire time I read it I was acutely aware that I was reading a book, and had to stop every few sentences to try to mentally translate what the narrator was saying. Palahniuk is trying for broken english, (I think?) but this borders on unreadable gibberish in places. Other works which make such whimsical use of the language have a purpose and logic behind them but I could never quite figure out what was being conveyed with this tricky writing. The narrator is obviously intelligent, and understands english well enough to hold his own pretty well in a spelling bee, so the idea that he just doesn't speak the language seems off. If it's simply a by-product of the super regimented lifestyle the narrator was brought up in... Well that doesn't fit either.

You see early on the narrator is supposed to be this super proficient spy, but how did his teachers just overlook the entire idea of making him somewhat able to speak the language of the country he's infiltrating? I can understand wanting to play the fish out of water angle for the kid, but seriously how are we supposed to believe that this agency is smart enough to co-ordinate the kind of plan they have in place and completely overlook any and all cultural training?

Sometimes when Palahniuk goes through such great lengths to exaggerate something, it's to a good effect, but this just didn't make any sense. Was there supposed to be some symbolic reason behind all this muddle? I didn't see one, and so I'm firmly saying the execution was sloppily done.

Aside from the prose, there really isn't anything here to hold me like his other works have. There wasn't a question in this book that pulled me through, making me desperate to get to the end. It was like this ""Shocking thing, Shocking thing, Some stuff about capitalism, Shocking thing, broadly drawn side characters, predictable twist, the end.""

C'mon, Chuck. Jeez man, get it together."
Pygmy,Matt,"May 28, 2009",2.0,"It would have been difficult, perhaps impossible, for ol' Chuck to publish a book worse than Snuff, which read like Palahniuk Parody and, honestly, seemed as though the author in question was simply (and as quickly as possible, as it had only been a year since the superb Rant) fulfilling a contract. So, yes, Pygmy is a more satisfying read than Palahniuk's previous outing. But that isn't saying much.

I give Chuck credit for the, uh, unique voice that relates the story: All broken English, euphemism, and metonymy. Unfortunately, it makes for frustrating reading (not necessarily a bad thing if, the reader feels, it is worth the effort) and is inconsistent, forcing me to believe it's more for comical effect than for actually stretching the boundaries of his style. Sure, there are a few laughs, and it does read a bit differently than his previous novels. But it's still pure Palahniuk: The cadence, the rhythm, the references, the crudeness. In fact, the entire story.

Ultimately, I had to force myself to pick up the book and read, as though I were on an assignment, and by the time I did finish (a point in time much further from my start date than I had anticipated), whatever hope and/or appreciation I had for this baby step up from Snuff was washed away.

If Chuck is going to continue putting out one mediocre book a year, essentially becoming a more left-of-center James Patterson, then, eventually, I may just give up on him. Then again, maybe he's just inconsistent (he did come back from the blah Haunted with Rant, one of my personal favorites). Either way, I recommend this only for Palahniuk completists. The story, though told in a ""new""-ish voice, isn't compelling, the ending wraps things up so quickly, neatly, and happily that the reader feels cheated, and, quite frankly, I feel my time may have been better spent rereading his better novels."
Pygmy,Ned Rifle,"November 22, 2012",1.0,"It has been many years since I read a Chuck Palahniuk novel. My memory of the three that I once read is hazy and my ideas of any one are likely my opinions of the others, seeing as they not only explore the same terrain but do it using the same techniques (barely remember anything other than the obligatory listing of facts, the most facile use of research possible? Perhaps it wasn't research and he simply had many useful cleaning tips which he thought it would be cruel not to share with the world).

I often find it largely unnecessary to comment on books, most often when the feelings are positive - I prefer to leave them as feelings. To find a great book which no-one has commented upon is a joy, you are in an infinitely more intimate and subtle conversation. Of course it is inevitable that this is rarely the case and indeed most things have had all that can be said about them said already - but not necessarily in the right combinations. This led me to the idea of reviewing things using only fragments of other peoples review in order to refine what has been said. May be tedious and indeed impossible but i will give it a go.

Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Just a Girl Fighting Censorship,"June 3, 2014",1.0,"Ugh, this was abysmal, truly terrible. I moderately enjoyed Nightlight: A Parody so I thought I'd give this a try. This is not even remotely funny, it's just stupid. Just changing the names of things does not a parody make, especially when the name changes themselves are uninspired and humorless.

You can find a parody on YouTube that will give you more laughs in 1 minute than the hours it will take you to trudge through this crap. Seriously, you want Harry Potter humor? Just visit Google."
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Glenn,"February 17, 2009",1.0,"Did you ever read Bored of the Rings? The Harvard Lampoon’s parody of Tolkien is one of the funniest little books I ever read. Crude, adolescent, and now terribly dated, it was also witty, inventive, and most of all funny. With fond memories of that parody in mind, I was looking forward to Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody. While it has all of the crudity and adolescence of it’s illustrious predecessor, it fall short in one major category. It isn’t all that funny. While the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was a quick read at over 700 pages, Barry Trotter was a slow read at under 180. The book parodies the series, the writer, the business of publishing and moviemaking, marketing, and pop-culture fandom, but has very little to say about any of those things that is either original or funny. I can recall only two occasions when I thought the writer had been genuinely witty, but he so overplayed the joke, as if in fear that his readership would be to stupid to get it, that he bludgeoned all possible humor from it. Note for all future writers of literary parody: just messing around with the names and making the characters a bit shabby does not equal instant humor."
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Winston Jen,"June 21, 2013",5.0,"I simply cannot compliment the author and the narrator enough. Not only is it a-laugh-a-line funny, but the high-level ventriloquism Christopher uses adds a level of shine that outstrips almost any reading experience. Just wait until you hear and imagine Barry Trotter hit the redial button on his uncle's address book. There are also references to the top actors and actresses of the day, but that doesn't really impede this book's withstanding of the test of time.

The book starts off simply, with Barry et al travelling to America to stop the latest Trotter film. Michael Gerber simply doesn't believe in the fourth wall, and this helps add to the comedic effect (case in point: Barry whines about the slow narration, keeping him on the stairs for several pages). I loved his parody of England's Sun newspaper (althought it was a case of TMI at one point).

While this is certainly not for everyone, those who enjoy toilet humour and R-rated comedy will enjoy this book with a 99% probability ratio."
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,K.,"January 17, 2020",2.0,"It was near Thanksgiving, and I was browsing a used bookstore in town when I came across this book. I picked it up on a whim. I thought it looked silly and was wanting to have a good laugh.

I will say the beginning started out strong. There were a few times when I laughed out loud. I told my husband ""Barry got me again."" It was dark, dirty humor. The appeal didn't last long, though. The cynicism became to be borderline nihilism. In fact, it was nihilism if you ask me. Then, towards the end the author takes a million left turns with the storyline. It was like he was drowning in his own self-loathing, and had to reroute the book to distract from his own mania. I'm not even kidding.

Also, the self-references at the end leads me to believe this author is just at complete narcissist. He thinks people are going to hate him for making fun of Harry Potter, when really they should hate him for making such a bad parody. He had the potential for making jokes, but didn't choose that route for whatever reason.

For a book that was supposed to be funny, this really missed the mark. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The only reason I gave it two stars, was for the strong start."
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Amelia,"March 30, 2014",1.0,"I could write a really long review explaining the manifold ways in which Barry Trotter and the Shameless Parody was a) stupid b) really stupid c) really really stupid and d) disgusting but I'm not going to waste my time when I can sum it up in a few words: endless toilet humour and sex jokes. Strangely I don't find the idea of Dumbledore pissing on a model of Harry or Hermione's top being turned invisible absolutely fucking hillarious, I wonder why? Maybe because I'm not a thirteen year old boy?

I shall now be petitioning Gerber for the 50p I wasted on this back. Helpfully, he included a form to do so...

Da bei meiner Ausgabe im letzten Drittel die Seiten falsch zusammengefasst wurden, hab ich mich direkt angesprochen gefühlt. Das Rumblättern und Suchen der Folgeseiten war bei dem Inhalt wahre Folter. Und ich frage mich immer noch: Absicht oder Mängelexemplar?

Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Brandon Wills,"December 1, 2022",5.0,A wonderful parody for any fan of Harry Potter
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Raima Its4eyedgal,"December 13, 2017",1.0,"Let me clear a few things before I start reviewing this satire. I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter series. They were the first ever series I read and it was love at first sight, or should I rather say, love at first read. I immediately fell in love with the writing, the plot, the twists, the places and especially the amazing characters. Each and every single detail mesmerised me and left me in awe. For me, it's still the perfect novel (series) ever written.

Moving ahead, I bought this parody to know what EXACTLY is it written about? Then another thought struck me like thunder, how can anyone even imagine writing a satire on Harry Potter? HOW? I was intrigued. I know, I shouldn't act too bewildered because people tend to ridicule what's famous, which is quite obvious but it still was too shocking for me.



Barry Trotter and the Shameless Parody is high in adult jokes and toilet humour. Every character that has been mentioned in this book from the original series by J.K Rowling has a distorted name, for example, Ron Weasely is Lon Measly, Hermoine Granger is Ermine Cringer, Dumbledore is Bumblemore and most obviously, Harry Potter is Barry Trotter.

I think it was rather a smart move by Michael Gerber not to use the original names because it would have been downright offensive and I guess, he didn't want his book to leave such a deep, negative impression. I still don't think the names were funny, they just sounded childish and ridiculous.

Almost every other character in the novel is a drunk and is stuck in the worst possible situation of their lives. Lon has totally lost his mind and is a complete lunatic due to an accident that occurred during a Quiddit (Quidditch) match, Ermine teaches in a poorly stated school where she has no respect and the students are abominable, Bumblemore is rude, impatient and a pervert, Serious Blech (Sirius Black) is always coming up with non-sensical and bizarre schemes which always require Barry's financial help, in short, Mr. Godfather is broke and also keeps on forgetting Barry's name. Serious Blech addresses Barry with names like Barty, Beany, Billy etc. The main ""hero"", Barry Trotter is a spoilt brat, without any doubt. He has been staying in Hogwash (Hogwarts) for quite a long time, regardless of his age (22 years old) because of his increasing popularity, which got the best of him (I doubt there was any ""good"" in him to begin with). He has no intention of leaving Hogwash, even if he does, his crazy, disgusting Muddle (Muggle) fans won't let him leave the premises because they have all resided right outside the school building on the lawn near Hafwid's (Hagrid) cabin who has every intention of killing the filthy Muddles because they constantly steal his booze and irritate him in every possible way. They literally are filthy because the entire lawn is covered in ankle-deep muck because of the lack of sanitary facilities.

The original story, however, has nothing to do with this parody. It's in no way close to what J.K Rowling wrote, which is such a relief. I believe, it would have been a low blow to detoriate the original story in any possible way.

The book intends to be funny and so it has its funny moments.

Basically, the story is about an adventure of Barry, Lon and Ermine. They travel to different places to find J.G Rollins (J.K Rowling) to stop the production of another book-based movie on Barry Trotter. Bumblemore sends Barry and Lon to the rescue mission. Ermine, on Barry's request (paying off her student loans) joins them because even in the parody she is good with spells. Bumblemore convinces Barry to stop the production because more singing, bleeding, fighting and God-knows what else-ing Muddle fans would encamp infront of the lawn making the situation go completely out of hand. Hogwash can not be moved magically because insurance doesn't permit it to. So yeah, it isn't really that magical. If you want to know the end, you'd have to read the book because there is a twist waiting at the very end.




My advice to all the people who are intending to read this book or accidentally come across it, don't take it seriously. I mean, don't hate the author. I have a feeling he is a fan of J.K Rowling, even if he isn't, I'm sure it's all in good humour. He didn't intend to attack, humiliate or disrespect J.K Rowling in any way. I mean, is it even possible?

So, read it, laugh and just keep it somewhere where you won't find it ever again."
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Johana,"November 14, 2022",4.0,Great comedy book that has references to the Harry Potter universe. I found the beginning and the ending to be really bad but the middle was great. It brought a lot of nostalgia and feeling that I want to read Harry Potter books again. I will probably try to find the next book in the series(it is not that common in here) and read it as it was really easy to pick up and I had fun reading it.
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Lisa,"January 26, 2020",1.0,DNF'd ☹️
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Jacob,"August 19, 2012",1.0,"I rarely rate a book before I finish it... but then, I rarely decide flat-out to not finish a book. I can usually at least CONVINCE myself there is a chance that I'm not wasting my time, that I'll get around to it eventually.

Not in this case.

There is exactly two demographics for Barry Trotter--people who read the first Harry Potter book and didn't care for it (and who have a crude sense of humor), and people who were forced to see the movie and hated it.

Every single character is a cop-out, for example:
Lon (aka, Ron)- someone whose brain has been replaced with a dogbrain and, uh, acts like a dog.
--Seriously? You take the loyal friend with so-so intelligence and turn him into a human dog. Very subtle.

Hafwid (aka, Hagrid)- The dumb, drunk gamekeeper.
--Seriously? You take the guy fond of alcohol and is kind of slow intellectually, and make him dumber and drunker? Hilarious.

And then there are attempted digs at Harry Potter which fail to land, simply due to inaccuracy. For example, there is a Quiddit (aka, Quidditch) scene and the author makes reference to how dumb it is that the person who catches the sneetch (snitch) wins the game, and how it makes for a convenient plot device. Except that's not how the game works. Granted, in the movie version they streamlined the rules that way... but the books clearly state that catching the snitch is worth 150 points. Score differential is more than that, the losing team catching the snitch won't suddenly win. Comments like this are lazy errors on the part of the author, who obviously doesn't care enough to understand the world he's trying to parody.

This could all be forgiven if the book was ever actually funny. And it is. On the title page there is a message from the publisher. Followed by a message from Satan. Followed by a message from some Christian group. And that is hilarious. But after you flip past that page it is a whole lot of boring, crude nothingness."
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,EpidermaS,"February 13, 2016",1.0,"Autor wyśmiewa nie tyle książkę Rowling, co wielką machinę marketingową wiążącą się z ową pozycją. To jedyny plus. Nooo, może jeszcze stylizacja Lorda Vielokonta na Niemca. ;) Reszta to totalne dno. Nie wiem, czemu Internauci uważają tę parodię za błyskotliwą. ""Błyskotliwa"" to ostatnie określenie, jakie do niej pasuje. Książka najzwyczajniej w świecie jest NUDNA. Powiem szczerze, że pierwowzór bywał miejscami śmieszniejszy.

Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Erin,"July 11, 2010",1.0,"I HATED IT. There are very few books that I will not finish and this is one of them. It bills itself as a parody of Harry Potter. It had the potential to be really funny, but I didn't find it funny. The facet that Gerber changed the names (Harry to Barry) wasn't too funny. He thought that being mean-spirited about everything would translate to humor, which it doesn't. I wish I could give it zero stars."
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Sophie,"July 11, 2020",4.0,"Especially with the whole JKR scandal lately, this parody was ... hysterically woke.

Overall it was really therapeutic to consume a HP satire with all the negativity surrounding the universe as of late."
Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,April Helms,"March 22, 2008",4.0,"A hysterical wink and poke parody of the Harry Potter series.

Barry Trotter and the Unauthorized Parody,Alex,"March 24, 2008",4.0,This was a very funny and inappropriate book. It parodies Harry Potter quite well and does so with childish potty humor. A very good read for all those with a warped mind and a desire to make fun of HP.

Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Roxane,"October 29, 2020",5.0,"Lauren Hough’s extraordinary essay collection Leaving Isn’t the Hardest Thing is as powerful as it is poignant. So many moments in this exceptionally crafted essays brought me to tears and before long I would find myself laughing as Hough wielded her razor sharp wit. This is a memoir in essays about so many things—growing up in an abusive cult, coming of age as a lesbian in the military, forced out by homophobia, living on the margins as a working class woman and what it’s like to grow into the person you are meant to be. Hough’s writing will break your heart. The ways she lays herself bare will leave you marveling at the strength it takes to reveal such delicate vulnerabilities. And when you come to the breathtaking end, you will know what it means to be entrusted with the beautifully messy truth of a person’s life. What an overwhelming, unforgettable offering Hough has made. This is one of those rare books that will instantly become part of the literary canon and the world of letters will be better for it."

of “Leaving Isn’t The Hardest Thing”......
I was soooo incredibly engrossed immediately —-
that after reading the first two stories: ‘Solitaire’ and ‘The Slide’....
I went to Twitter and typed Lauren Hough’s name....
wondering....
“Who the hell is this woman?”....
.....SHE SHOULD BE ON TV...SHE HAS A PERSONALITY FOR IT......FOR HER OWN SHOW....
Lauren Hough is INTERESTING AS ALL GET UP!!!
Ha...it was no accident that I notice Rachel Maddow was a big fan and following her too.

Lauren has had life experiences that are shocking, hilarious, incandescent, heartbreaking, brutal, disturbing, cringing, laughable, sultry, and just plain fascinating. .....
Her stories are deeply personal ...edgy... unapologetic....

The language and subject matter is raw, thought-provoking- sometimes excruciating harrowing, rigorous, piercing, extremely gut-wrenching, humorous, down right fascinating.....
.......and sizzling exquisite!

There is a fair amount of profanity and explicit sex — so I wouldn’t suggest reading this to your children....
But for MOST ADULTS....who can tolerate a little walk on the dark side in your in reading diet....
even if not in your own life....readers could easily be blown away by this book.....by Lauren’s life! She sure knows how to tell a story and hold our interest.

We learn a lot about Lauren through her memoir essays....and if you’re like me....you’re left being a huge fan. I’m now a regular follower of Lauren on Twitter. She’s so real - she makes me laugh...and cringe at the same time!

When I look at Lauren’s physical size ( wouldn’t want to piss her off).....lol....
next to my size....I wondered if she might consider being friends with pint size straight married old fart — such as me?

I’ll admit it....sometimes I simply fall in love with authors whose books affect ( not necessarily known as the greatest authors in the world but something about ‘them’ or their work moves me profoundly, > whose exuberance disposition excite me......
thinking:
Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Dave Eggers, Vendela Vida, Claire Fuller, Isabel Allende, Robin Black, David Vann, Stephen King, Mary Roach, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Isabel Wilkerson, Anna Quinlan, Liz Moore, Dani Shapiro, Augusten Burroughs, ....etc...etc...that I simply want to have them over for dinner...hang out with them!!!
Lauren Hough just joined my fantasy dinner list!

Laughing here ....wondering??? What authors are fantasy dinner guests for you? (my reading friends?)....

All I really want to say is....I am so darn glad I didn’t miss reading Lauren Hough’s first book of essays.
I will be following her on Twitter. And if Lauren gets her own TV show, I’m going to try to figure out how to be a guest on.

Extraordinary essays from a kick ass woman who has been a cable gal technician, an airman in the U.S. Air Force, a bartender, a barista, delivery driver, dabbled in drugs, sex with men & women, grew up in a God cult, ....was born in Germany...raised in seven countries and West Texas.
She lives in Austin today.

A little sample writing from Lauren Hough:
“There are levels of privilege. Now that I’ve jumped a level, from blue-collar asshole, possibly crazy veteran with a criminal record, to writer who no one would suspect has a criminal record, or if they do suspect, they don’t care, I do have to talk about it. For nothing will change. Because people still believe, despite all the evidence, that cops don’t lie, that the system is just, that people in jail deserve jail, and, mostly, that it won’t happened to them. I can tell you solitary confinement is torture. I can quote the stats on who’s in jail, how many are serving serious time who haven’t been convicted of anything at all.
But unless you understand it can happen to you, to someone who looks like you, that you can end up in solitary, guilty or not, and lose your goddamn mind, unless I can make you feel it, you won’t fucking care”

You rock, Lauren Hough!

Want to come for dinner?"
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Theresa Alan,"February 17, 2021",5.0,"This is so well-written and so hard to read. Lauren Hough was born into a cult in which it was common for people to swap partners and if you were female, you were taught to sexually please men even if were only 12 years old. The cult was called various names, including The Family of Love, which had famous adherents like Rose McGowan and River and Joaquin Phoenix. The followers had to be completely dependent on David Berg, their alcoholic leader and failed preacher, so that meant abject poverty, and being forced to sell things like posters to passersby to convert them. They were taught that anything was OK if it was done in love, so if you lured a man to bed for money, it wasn’t prostitution if you told him about Jesus.

Add to that Lauren is a lesbian. When your entire upbringing has taught you to please males, being a six-foot-tall lesbian is a challenge. Then she joined the Air Force, and things didn’t get better. Her struggles with poverty and acceptance and making terrible relationship choices because she had no idea what healthy relationships should look like make for a harrowing read. She talks about the inanity of our “justice” system that unequally punishes the poor and black folks. Lauren is white, and her struggles with insomnia and PTSD were all helped by marijuana, which was not legal for a long time and is still not legal everywhere. Thus, she tried all the antidepressants the VA would supply her with, but those didn’t help the problem, they just made her move through life like a zombie.

She did a lot of work as a bartender or bouncer, which paid barely enough to live in squalor, and meant that she and her friends would have to go to work sick because they didn’t get paid otherwise. Her personal experiences with being poor, getting into the prison system, struggling with anger and lack of education and lack of access to healthcare make for an important lens with which to view these issues.

Thanks to NetGalley for the opportunity to review this novel, which RELEASES APRIL 13, 2021."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Lisa of Troy,"January 19, 2023",2.0,"Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing is a collection of non-fiction essays by Lauren Hough. Lauren writes about a variety of topics: growing up in a cult, being a lesbian, her experiences being poor, what her experience was like in the Air Force, PTSD, and more.

First, I want to address something right off the bat. On my Youtube channel, I have zero tolerance for disrespect. The book community is one of the nicest, kindest, most open communities possible. Personally, I really enjoy finding people who read the same book that I read and feel the complete opposite of how I feel (maybe I missed something, maybe the other side has a valid point, maybe I can learn something). However, I am respectful. I still like people's videos that I disagree with. But anyone who is personally attacking another person, I'm out. I ban those folks from my channel. Hate has no home on my channel.

When I was on my GoodReads account, I was super excited because I saw that this book was getting quite a few reviews. What was going on? Lauren Hough, the author, put out a Tweet attacking a GoodReads reviewer for a 4 star rating and stating that no one likes this person. This is not acceptable. We talk about basic universal income. How about we start with basic universal respect? That should be the bare minimum. The book community are my peeps so my heart hurts that the author would do this to one of my own.

As I have never been one to jump on the band wagon or endorse cancel culture, I will now review the book. The book started off strong. Lauren started with a story of her time in the military as a lesbian. It was really quite shocking. This essay reminded me that it wasn't that long ago where people didn't feel safe enough to display rainbow flags, that there are times when the LGBTQ community are not safe and still subject to discrimination. Lauren has a down-to-earth writing style, and she writes to you as if she is your friend. However, I felt that the book went downhill from there. One of the main reasons why I wanted to read this book was because I am fascinated by cults. Lauren mentioned she grew up in one, The Family or The Children of God. She didn't tell the story in a very compelling way. She repeatedly told us it was horrible instead of showing us how horrible it was. Many people grow up extremely poor and move around a lot. That isn't particularly unique.

I was actually very disappointed in this book because Lauren makes a few great points. It sucks to be poor. People can work really hard and still be poor. People can be one misstep away from bankruptcy. The criminal justice system is unfair to the poor. Drugs laws need to be rewritten. When someone has mental health problems, waiting a couple of months for an open appointment is not acceptable. However, her writing was poorly developed. She dropped so many F bombs. I mean a few here and there OK. But after awhile, just give it a break. It was really a shame that the storytelling wasn't better developed because I really do think that many of her ideas are valid.

*Thank you, NetGalley, for a free ecopy of this book in exchange for my fair and honest opinion.

Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Kristen M.,"August 10, 2021",5.0,"I read books for a living. Sometimes, once in a great while, a writer pierces that tough husk of my heart. But not often. Lauren Hough takes spectacular sharpshooter aim and hits the bullseye in 'Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,' a collection of essays about several defining chapters of her life.

My first encounter with Lauren's writing was her 2018 longform essay: 'I Was A Cable Guy'


She is also currently one of my guilty pleasures on Twitter. Lauren is an Air Force veteran in her 40s, 6 feet tall, a lesbian and a childhood survivor of an abusive cult called the Family. She also has a Ted Talk which featured one of her essays, about being jumped outside an Alabama gas station, after a high school girl mistook her for a dude coming out of the women's bathroom.

After she left the Air Force in her early 20s, she spent a few aimless years as a bouncer at gay clubs in DC, among other entry level jobs. She then spent a decade long stint as a cable installer in the Virginia suburbs while she figured a few things out.

Lauren threads her experiences and memories together with a sharp wit and distinct humor. She attempts to make sense of what happened to her. The older I get, the more I realize that this kind of self-propelled journey is a gift bestowed upon the lucky few who choose to lean into the work. Most don't because it's too hard.

Everyone's messy life chapters vary. Lauren emerges plucky enough to find and develop some useful tools in her toolbox over time. She unpacks all of the crummy details AND the beautiful details. She tries to make meaning from the suffering.

I tried to highlight what it was that drew me so much to Lauren's story. It could be all of the hysterical lesbian drama that left me howling and guffawing (apparently you have not lived until you've issued an itemized bill for sexual services to a financially abusive girlfriend).

It could also be my obsession with the exposé of both Scientology and NXIVM, my adoration of Dan Savage, Lauren's uncanny ability to become a chameleon on demand when her safety required it, my preference for reading about the military, me not fitting in either, and maybe mostly - my status as the daughter of a Vietnam Marine combat veteran who could also not be de-escalated. There is some serious nervous system hypervigilance that only folks that have experienced it can comprehend. Lauren ticks off several boxes.

I found kinship in her experiences that struck many chords. Mournful chords, but hopeful ones too. She reminds me that sometimes the most insightful commentary comes from the broken ones who knit themselves back together stitch by stitch. When you're done reading this, you'll want to have a beer with Lauren too - and ask her how she made it after all.

Lastly, I was struck by how much these essays are veritable time capsules. Lauren insists she was awful at pop culture because she was nomadically gypsied around the world by her end-of-times cult. However, her references to music and other minute details deliver me back in time to the 90s.

In more than one chapter, I am verily transported in my mind to a Lilith Fair concert wearing Teva sandals, smoking a roach in a Grateful Dead tie-dye t-shirt with that silver metal jingle ball necklace on a long black cord, undulating with the crowd to 'Building A Mystery'. Sigh.

I was so inspired reading this book, reminiscing on the soundtrack and anthems of my youth that I made my own 90s 'mixtape' on Spotify with all these time-stamped memories of my own. Enjoy my jaunt down memory lane:

Lauren: keep going with this writing thing. The world needs more of you and your perspective. Thanks for your book, I can't wait to see more of what's next for you.

Thank you to Edelweiss for providing me with an advance copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. I can't believe you all have to wait until April 2021 to get a copy of this. It is worth the wait. I also enjoyed it so much, I read it chapter by chapter over 'Election Week' savoring each morsel and passage slowly, because I did not want it to end.

Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Skyler Autumn,"April 19, 2021",5.0,"ALL THE BLOODY STARS

I haven't read this book yet wasn't even on my radar but definitely going to read it now, and I'm gonna throw in 5 star rating to help offset the 1 stars. Even if it's the shittiest book in the world.

If you don't want to support her don't read the book this bombing someone's hard work into oblivion is nasty. She went on twitter and called us childish assholes, then we turn around and prove her right by being childish assholes. Who cares what an author says about us, God knows we say enough shit about their books. If we can dish it out, we should be able to take it.

One of the 1 star reviewers wrote And you know what that can be turned around really easy, cause if you're going to give a 1 star rating to a book you haven't read yet, then you shouldn't be a book reviewer."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Jenna ❤ ❀ ❤,"August 29, 2021",5.0,"I wanted to give this one star because of how the author was hating on reviewers who granted it ""only"" 4 stars (WTF, Lauren?!)...... but I can't. I loved the book. It's witty and I identified with way too much of her story.

No cult childhood for me but the evangelical crazy bullshit upbringing is so similar.

So yeh, I wanted to not like this and give it only one star but I absolutely loved it. It's a terrific memoir, funny and not self-pitying. Entertaining and interesting and I'm glad I forgot I wasn't going to read it because of the author's remarks.... until I was half way through it and remembered and by that time, I was enjoying it too much to stop.

.

Hell yeh! Did I mention how much I identified with this book?

If you enjoy memoirs, don't let the one stars or the author's remarks put you off it."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Bridget,"November 16, 2020",5.0,"Do you ever click with someone at a party or a bar? Not romantically but you're just on the same level at the same time and you're telling stories and sharing confidences and they are the most interesting person in the room, on the block, maybe the whole planet. You leave that night, high on a friend crush but then never manage talk to them again.
That's how reading this book felt, each essay is part of that long conversation, in turns smart, intimate, nihilist, and funny as shit. Hough writes in places like she's sharing a smoke with you (Badlands) and in other places like the single voice of reason in a world that is a cacophony of bullshit (Everything That's Beautiful Breaks My Heart.)

Thanks NetGalley for a chance to read this early and to the author for your words."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,hannah,"April 13, 2021",1.0,this was the worst book ive ever read ://
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Levi Pierpont,"July 14, 2021",5.0,"A fantastic book that people would like if they grew up and read it.

TW: This book may give you some anxiety if you are queer. There are many depictions of hate-based violence and discrimination.

Speaking of military exercises in the Air Force, Hough writes, ""An exercise is when you go somewhere else to play solitaire on your computer because you’re not allowed to read at your desk—reading would look unprofessional.""

First, before my actual review: this is something that frustrates me about not just military desk jobs, but all other desk jobs I've worked: reading doesn't look professional. Drawing doesn't look professional. Just about any productive thing you could do with your time, at your desk, after you've finished your work but you still have to be available, doesn't look professional. So instead, millions of workers across the world peruse the news or check their email compulsively because if you're staring at your computer, you look like a worker. Never mind the fact that a book could offer you a deeper understanding of the world and improve your work, not to mention the rest of your life. Just keep looking like you're working.

Back to the review.

I think of myself as pretty privileged, because I am. I'm White, I'm pretty much a guy, (I'm fine with he/him, but I don't like ""son"" or ""mister"") and yeah, I'm queer, but my day-to-day life isn't so affected by that, and my being a man and my being White makes it easier. I might get looks in the store if I am with a guy, and it's not the most comfortable thing, but it obviously could be worse.

This book felt necessary to me because it reminded me that for older generations of queer folk, it wasn't that easy. They were spit on, beaten, ridiculed, pushed to the margins of society in every way. But they persevered, and I owe every ounce of comfort I have today to those women and men and people. Still, Hough has this keen awareness throughout her writing of her own privilege as a White person, an awareness that is sometimes rare when White people are marginalized.

Reading this book felt like listening to the stories of my cultural forebears. Not only telling me, ""appreciate how good you have it,"" but also, ""remember it wasn't always this good. Remember it still isn't this easy for lots of others.""

Everything that crosses over between Hough's experience and my own--the Air Force, a fringe religious upbringing, being queer--strikes me as utterly relatable. Today, the Air Force is a lot more accepting of queer people, especially in ""chair force"" career fields like my own. This was a policy shift DOD-wide, but more than that, it was a culture shift, and I honestly can't speak for other branches of the military. To be clear, I'm not speaking for the Air Force, either.

This was a perfect blend of memoir and essay collection, and both the author and Cate Blanchett make great narrators for the audiobook. I would recommend this to everyone, but especially queer people, people who have had to deconstruct or walk away from a faith that held major importance in their lives, and those in the military or who have been in the military.

Lauren Hough, if you see this, thank you. Thank you for this book. I'm in Minot, and it's really not so bad here. Someday, it would be really cool to interview you for my podcast. A few people listen. I hope everyone reads this book and you get all the success that you deserve."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Katie,"May 30, 2021",5.0,"This is going to be the longest Goodreads review I have ever written, so buckle up.

I’d only vaguely heard of Lauren Hough- I remembered reading her cable guy essay, which I enjoyed, and I’d read a couple of articles about this book when it was about to be released, so I headed over to Goodreads to check the reviews, which I often do to help me decide whether or not to read a book. Much to my surprise, the average review was less than 2, which is almost unheard of. I soon found out that this was not due to the book itself, but because of a beef several Goodreads reviewers had with the author.

What, pray tell, had she done? Had she killed someone? Been accused of sexual misconduct? Abused a girlfriend? Said or done something racist/transphobic/ableist or discriminatory in any other way? Supported a heinous political position? Been rude to waitstaff? Kicked a puppy?

None of the above. She *checks notes* posted a snarky joke on Twitter about people who leave 4.5 star reviews that included a Goodreads screenshot.

Now, if an author did that with one of my reviews, I’d laugh. I’d probably even be a bit flattered that an author NOTICED my review, and I think I’d probably reach out to the author, maybe make a joke of my own.

But that’s not what hundreds of outraged, thin-skinned Goodreads reviewers did. They took it extremely personally and proceeded to bombard the book with 1-star ratings and negative reviews and scream at anyone who dared to suggest that they were in the wrong.

This kind of thing really makes me hate the Goodreads community. I have heard every justification in the book that people have given for purposely tanking the reviews in revenge for Lauren’s tweets deemed insufficiently deferential to the almighty Goodreads reviewer. Here’s where I collect them all in one place and tell you why they’re wrong.

These are the arguments Goodreads reviewers have made:

-

Uh, no. Posting a screenshot of a PUBLIC review that only contains an avatar and a first name is not “doxxing” by any stretch of the imagination.

-

No. Not only did she not incite harassment in any way, but no one actually harassed the reviewer at all. Lauren is the one who’s been harassed. The reviewer in question has since taken her review down, but while it was up, all of the comments on that review were from people outraged at Lauren. Not a single comment harassing the reviewer in any way. In fact, before taking the review down, the reviewer left a pretty mild comment of her own saying that she found it baffling but that it was a shame that people wouldn’t read the book because of it. So. Think about that.

-

What a massive exaggeration. It is insulting to actual victims of abuse to call any of Lauren’s behavior in this situation “abusive.” Nothing she did could in any way be called “bullying,” “abusive,” or “attacking.” Yet I’ve seen those words used over and over. I didn’t even think “nerd” was considered an insult anymore. And who knew that people would get so offended over swear words like asshole and fucking? You’re really THAT insulted by what she said?

-

I am extremely familiar with Kathleen Hale. You can even read (which is a review of THE BOOK, not what Kathleen did). Are you honestly comparing a comment on Twitter to actual, in-person, physical STALKING?! By the way, the average rating for this book? LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE RATING FOR TWO OF KATHLEEN HALE’S BOOKS. And until recently, lower than the ratings for all three of her books. Chew on that for a minute.

-

Uh, no, actually, she just pointed out that her book had a lower average rating than Mein Kampf, as well as a lot of books by crazy right-wingers. If you’d read the book, you’d know that Lauren herself survived a rape as a teenager that resulted in a pregnancy. I think she’s earned the right to compare things that trigger her to rape.

-

Oh, the horror! You’d never do that, would you?

-

If you say so!

-

Let’s get something straight right now: It is bizarre that people are taking this so personally.

-

I mean, hey, we all have different senses of humor. But you’d know, if you’d read the book, that Lauren tends to joke about serious things to minimize negative feelings. And clearly, you consider Goodreads reviews a Very Serious Thing.


Aside from all of the above arguments, here’s what I’ve seen Goodreads reviewers do:

They’ve accused her of being “antisemitic” for (correctly) pointing out that her book had a lower average rating than Mein Kampf.

They’ve posted reviews that called her a b***h and a c**t.

They’ve falsely spread rumors that she’s a TERF (not only is she not, she’s specifically ).

They’ve claimed, without providing a shred of evidence, that Lauren and/or her Twitter followers tried to get a reviewer fired.

They’ve locked their Goodreads accounts upon encountering any opposition to their opinions, because they’re cowards who can dish it out but not take it.

All of this on TOP of purposely tanking the book’s ratings.

You people honestly think this is a proportionate reaction? If you really were offended by this stupid drama, the correct response would be not reading the book and moving on with your life. But all of the above responses are SEVERAL TIMES WORSE than anything Lauren did.

Goodreads reviews are for rating THE BOOK. Not for getting revenge for some manufactured Twitter drama.

If you’re one of the thin-skinned, petty, hysterical whiners who did any of the above things, well, I can’t actually say what I want to say to you. So just imagine the worst possible thing anyone could possibly say to you and imagine that I looked you in the eye and said it.

Now. Onto my review of the actual book. Which, by the way, this whole debacle convinced me to actually buy, when normally I would have just checked it out from the library.

I’m so glad that this book is excellent and I can honestly say that it’s worthy of five stars. It’s a book of autobiographical essays from a writer who’s had a really interesting life. Among her experiences: she grew up in a cult (the Family, formerly known as the Children of God). Her parents divorced when she was young and she and her siblings were split up. (Side note: this is weirdly the second book in a row I’ve read by someone to whom that happened. Is this more common than I realized or are people who go through that just more likely to become writers?) She spent the rest of her childhood living with her mom and an abusive stepfather. She joined the Air Force, where she endured a rape and discrimination for being gay, culminating in a hate crime for which she was blamed and courtmartialed, and was eventually discharged under Don’t Ask Don’t Tell. She was homeless for a period of time. She’s spent time in jail. She’s lived with PTSD and depression and endured abusive relationships. She’s worked as a bouncer at a gay bar as well as a cable guy and several other blue-collar jobs.

I have very little in common with Lauren, but she has a real talent for drawing the reader into her world. Her style is straightforward and unpretentious but also touches on some important truths. An essay will be laugh-out-loud funny in one place and, a couple of paragraphs later, take a turn for the serious and/or universal. If you’ve read the cable guy essay, which is funny, serious, and a microcosm of America all at the same time, that’s pretty much what all of her essays are like. At one point she describes suburban families outside a restaurant in this way: “They looked like people who drank milk with dinner.” Which cracked me up because my family, who sounds a lot like the families she’s describing, literally did do that. I also really enjoyed this description of cops: “Cops are dumb as shit. They’re insular and thin-skinned and get off on making people cry. They’re misogynists. They’re racists. And they don’t generally give a shit about pot. But pot has a strong smell and they’ll use the excuse if they need to make quota, or if they don’t like you.”

My only negative comment is that there are some errors like missing words that a copyeditor should have caught. But I loved this book, and I’m glad I bought it, even if took some dumb Goodreads drama to bring it to my attention."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Kate,"April 20, 2021",1.0,Any book written by members of the US armed forces that doesn't so much as even mention the imperialism inherent in the US military is not nearly a good enough book. One star.
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,xTx xTx,"January 2, 2021",5.0,"Honesty. Honest. That's my first word for this book. Ms. Hough could've easily sensationalized her history but instead she shared it. Her struggle with it. But more about her struggle with who she was. The cult, secondary. And, actually, that was, for me, the more interesting. She helped me see how I have my own 'growing up' issues. Looking for pictures, words, people that can give evidence to what/how things were during my 'growing up.' Nothing too flowerly...which i normally love...but the honesty, the matter of factness tethered me to her words. I rooted for her. I wish i could have coffee with her. nice way to ring in my new year. Hi Lauren. I'm a writer too. My brother just moved outside of Austin. Maybe we can have a coffee one day. I'm not weird. I mean, Yeah, actually, I'm weird, but i'm friends with Roxane Gay so, i'm like, safe weird. :-)"
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Taylor Stevens,"April 14, 2021",5.0,"LEAVING ISN’T THE HARDEST THING is a memoir, but not in the traditional sense. It’s a book of essays that are neither chronological nor directly related, and yet through them a life story unfolds. I loved this book for so many reasons but recommend it specifically for fans of my own work who are curious about the cult I came from. The author is a fellow survivor and although this book isn't about the cult specifically, the cult permeates everything, and this is the most realistic, raw, and unbelievably honest telling of the immense struggle of dealing with the aftermath while trying to adjust to a strange and foreign outside world as I have ever read. It is that and so much more."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Susan,"April 15, 2021",5.0,"I've followed Lauren on Twitter for a while (since the viral article a few years back), so when I saw the tweet that caused the fuss, I took it as her humor--and cringed a little on her behalf, having been on GR for a long time and guessing that that tweet would not go over well, whether she intended it as humor or not.

It did not go over well.

Anyway, as far as her book is concerned, the essays are forthright and raw, sometimes funny, sometimes upsetting, always deeply moving. Kinda like her Twitter, tbh."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Siria,"December 1, 2021",5.0,"This memoir-in-essays hangs together far better than most examples of this genre. Lauren Hough has a gift for having each essay—about her childhood in the infamous Children of God cult, her time in the Air Force, her experiences as a lesbian in the 90s and as a blue-collar worker struggling to get by—reference and build on one another without feeling forced. Hough's voice throughout is mordantly funny, brimming with righteous and frustrated anger at systemic dysfunctions and hypocrisies.

Come for the startled laughter at the kinds of things cable repair people will find in nondescript suburban basements; stay for Hough's slowly burgeoning comparison between the abusive, free-love, hippie-Jesus cult of her childhood and the all-encompassing cult of consumerist American Exceptionalism."

Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Zoe,"April 18, 2021",5.0,"This book tore my heart up in the best way - engaging from start to finish, funny, and very moving. It also captures a time and place in queer history rarely engaged with in literature."

Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,F.E. Feeley Jr.,"April 20, 2021",5.0,"If the cliche that, ""Love is Love"" is true - then perhaps ""A cult, is a cult, is a cult,"" is also true - because, damnit, Lauren - if you've not written my life in the pages of your book (not as well-traveled grant you but still) I'm the Queen of England.
Lauren Hough is a master storyteller. Her ability to paint a picture of desperation on the fringes of life is nothing short of awe-inspiring while the stories contained herein are grotesque and brutal, that all the while, turn an accusatory gaze up at the world of latte-sipping, blog posting, scarf-wearing, ""woke""- tweeting, middle America who've convinced themselves of their progressiveness, or their societal awareness because they've read a book written by Maya Angelou or Toni Morrison or call themselves 'an ally.'
An accusation the world deserves. Full stop.
Simply put, there's a world operating underneath this one that we live in, that people don't have the first fucking clue about. And that world is the world of cults. And you don't have to belong to a sex cult, like Lauren was, to see this. The David Koresh's and Jim Jones of the world were the obvious ones.
The fundamentalists of other brands are out there. Chances are, you have them in your own neighborhood.
Lauren presents the truth in an unpretty, unrestrained, and unapologetic book that should rock the senses of anyone with even the slightest shred of human decency about them. The slave master of old isn't dead, he's picked up a Bible, had a vision, and is now in command of thousands of souls. Souls who've had children that are now captive audiences to the horrendous behaviors of the morally depraved and predatory actions of a dystopian god.
In the era of #metoo and #timesup and #churchtoo, this book should be required reading for anyone attempting to deconstruct their own cult experiences to show that, even on the fringes, their experiences are not that rare, that they're not really alone, and that there's healing in that."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Jennifer,"February 1, 2021",5.0,"For a short period, I worked for a cult, which is part of what drew me to this book. The main thing that made me want to read it, though, is Lauren’s writing. Her essays and her Twitter feed are pretty excellent reading material, so I figured a book by her would also be exceptional. And it is.

There are parts that are hard to read, like the chapter she writes about being in jail. The writing was so vivid, I could feel like I was there with her — not an experience I hope to relive. It was impossible not to feel the things she felt, to hear the voices she heard.

Earlier chapters, like those about her discharge from the Air Force and her early years as an out lesbian in DC, were equally well crafted. I couldn’t stop reading them though I had other things I should have been doing.

My one complaint is that many of the essays in the book were published elsewhere first and left fully intact here, which at times made for a strange experience, as you got reintroduced to people and facts as if you hadn’t just read about them in detail a few pages earlier in another chapter. But that’s a bone to pick with the editor and not Lauren. Her work is exceptional here.

If you found this book because of Lauren’s viral cable guy essay from a few years back, you’re in luck: that essay is included here, but is not even close to the best in the book."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Andrea Avery,"April 12, 2021",5.0,"From the very first sentence of the first essay in this collection, you know you're in the hands of someone who knows herself very well. Someone with a certain and unshakeable center and a voice she can deploy through a dazzling range of sincerity, humor, grief, rage. Over the course of the book, you come to learn how hard-won that center, that voice, is. Lauren Hough masterfully balances all of the modes available to her as a memoirist. She discloses things with absolutely disarming candor, as clear-eyed about herself as she is about others--but not once in this book does the work dip into self-indulgence or self-flagellation. The book also does what is ever so much harder to do in memoir, which is to implicate the reader ... this book will get up in you, all over you. But here, too, her deftness as a writer saves the work from ever being lecture or holding forth. It's laser-tuned. The last essay in the book absolutely broke me. I will read anything this writer puts out into the world and can't wait for her next thing."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Juju,"April 18, 2021",5.0,"To all the snowflake reviewers who left one star on the assumption that the author is an asshole, this same “asshole” (having never met me) drove across 3 states to hand me frozen protein shakes on my cross US bike ride, two years later she went ahead and saved my life by intuiting that I was in grave medical danger. She may be the most empathetic person I know and her only fault maybe that she feels too much...which is exactly why she writes about the human experience in such an impactful way that hits home and brings it home to you. So sit and judge from the comfort of anonymity because hitting the one star button gives you some kind of power trip and makes you feel relevant. You’re only proving yourselves the smaller by doing so. I loved the book and love the author who wrote it even more."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Mandy Hazen,"January 15, 2021",5.0,"I am a huge fan of short stories. Lauren did not disappoint. So many of these stories are heart breaking Raw and real. Some are full of love and light and hope. Some are full of laughter. I couldn’t put it down and found myself wanting to read page after page and learn more about Lauren’s life. I especially appreciated her reflection on the privilege of her life and how it had perhaps altered different paths and other choices. Very well written. I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Vincent Scarpa,"January 5, 2021",5.0,"“There were lesbian movies, sure. But the common theme of lesbian movies in the ’90s was: There’s this lesbian who’s in love with Mary-Louise Parker, who’s nice to the lesbian. Then Mary-Louise Parker dies. That was the dream back then: one day you might have a straight friend who isn’t shitty to you.”"
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Thomas Pluck,"December 10, 2020",5.0,"This memoir reads like a great crime novel. An escape from a cult, bouncing in gay bars and living in cars to the DC lockup, it’s an outsider’s view of the Cult of the American dream from an unforgettable new voice. Sometimes funny, other times razor sharp, a fellow working class writer’s first book and one of my best reads of this year. Out in 2021, but get in line now."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Elon Green,"April 13, 2021",5.0,"It's a bit hard to summarize this book, and so I won't. But once you finish, it feels like a minor miracle the book got written at all, and a major miracle that it's so goddamn brilliant."

Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Jessica Haider,"May 19, 2021",4.0,"Lauren Hough grew up as a part of the infamous cult, The Children of God, where she as a child and teen was expected to do her part to make sure the males in the group were satisfied. As part of the cult she moved around the world. As an adult, she joined the military and dealt with the ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" policy as a lesbian. She's held many jobs such as bouncer and ""cable guy"" and even did a stint in prison. In this collection of raw, honest essays, Hough shares her experiences reckoning with her life as a child who grew up in a cult and being a working-class lesbian in the south. I found the essays to be engrossing and well-written. I recommend this one to fans of #ownvoices essays, telling the real life experiences of people that are outside main stream America.

I know this book's average rating has experienced some fallout from one of the author's tweets, however I am reviewing this book without taking that into consideration. This doesn't mean I condone that tweet."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Daniella Mestyanek,"June 4, 2022",5.0,"""I learned early that if everyone around you has their head bowed, their eyes shut tight--keep your eyes open and look around.""--Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing

This book is bold, no punches are pulled, & if you walk away not questioning every institution & system, read it again.

I grew up in the Children of God/the Family and a military veteran (as so many of us are), and I echo the things Lauren says so eloquently in her book--the things cults do, and the reasons cults work, are the same things at play in our society and groups around us. ""Cults just say the quiet part out loud.""

But even if you have never heard of a religious cult, or don't know any veterans, you're in some kind of group, trying to find your place in society, and, like so many of us, perhaps questioning why you do things the way you do, or think the way you think. Lauren's book will be the crack in your brainwashing, and you'll never think the same way again.

Lauren's stories and searingly personal and powerful essays will make you laugh, cry, but most of all think. Think about the way cult kids are programmed, the way kids in the Airforce are programmed, and the way that you were programmed too--because you were. We all are.

Read this book. Maybe a few times. It's worth it."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Angela,"February 26, 2021",5.0,"I tend to enjoy memoirs more than your average bear (if bears do, in fact, enjoy memoirs). But Lauren Hough's Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing is the crème de la crème. Hough's personal essays are composed of all the elements that make up a great memoir: compelling stories, good writing, and a relatable/likable narrator.

Let me start with the stories. Holy guacamole has this woman seen some THINGS. She was raised in a sex cult known as the Family. She is a lesbian who was in the Air Force in the days of DADT and the essay that details the reasons why she left is mind blowing (I'd think it was completely made up if I didn't know this was a memoir). She went to jail because... well, the mechanics behind that one are also stranger than fiction. She's been all kinds of harassed during her stints as both a cable woman and a bar bouncer. The sordid details of just one of these essays is enough to make your head spin - and yet this woman was able to craft eleven unique tellings of outrages things she's experienced in her life. It doesn't make for an easy life, but it makes for a fascinating one.

Hough's writing is uniquely her. She's sarcastic and witty and hilarious. These stories, if penned by another author, could come across as angsty and bitter. But Hough's voice makes them more it-is-what-it-is followed by a glimmer of hope. Don't get me wrong - she's no Pollyanna. But these stories didn't come across as incredibly depressing as they could have been. Instead, they come across at times as funny, at times as not-so-funny, but always leaving the reader something to ponder.

As soon as I finished this book my first thought was that I'd love to sit down and discuss it with Hough over a beer. Hell, I'd love to just chat with her about anything. If these essays are any indication, she's immensely likable, relatable, interesting, humble, and other adjectives with positive connotations that are escaping me at the moment. Although my life has been anything but similar to Hough's, I have a feeling we'd be able to find common ground nevertheless.

One minor gripe (a gripette, if you will) is that since these were all published as individual essays before they were smooshed together to make this here fine collection, there are a number of instances where there's some heavy overlap in the details from one essay to the next. It was a little awkward to read an anecdotal story in one essay to have it pop up again later in the collection and have it treated as if it was the first time said anecdote was revealed to the reader.

Thanks bunches to NetGalley for this ARC in exchange for my honest review."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Mary Beth,"September 7, 2021",5.0,"Many of Hough’s experiences are dismaying, sometimes hard to relate to on the surface, but she writes about them with eloquence and powerful insights, using her childhood experiences in a horrific cult to make incisive points about much more mainstream society. A wry, cutting sense of humor pervades the essays, but Hough isn’t flip, and her righteous anger (which is, frankly, invigorating in its own right) is tempered by compassion for people who often don’t receive such empathy."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Katherine Catmull,"September 11, 2021",5.0,I loved this. It's exquisitely written in a hard-to-define way--bleak and authentic and hilarious and often heartbreaking. Such a vivid voice for every trauma and ugliness joy and freindship she describes. I'm so sad to see her ratings brought down by people who haven't read the book. I can't wait to read her next.

5 stars

I loved every second of reading these essays, even when they were deeply scarring - and they were - and I can't wait to read more.

Hough's life is riveting, and the kind of person with her experiences might roll them up, tuck them away, and smile like the lady in the ""Black Hole Sun"" video as they try to go through life with a history of unimaginable trauma. Or, they can be the one of the most riveting and vulnerable storytellers you've ever encountered. Obviously, Hough takes the latter path.

Some of Hough's experiences might not be relatable to every reader (lucky you!), but there is not a moment when SHE seems unrelatable, and that is a feat. Her writing is funny, biting, cathartic, exposing, and gripping, and I am fully addicted to it. You will be, too.

Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Bethany Kelly,"April 28, 2021",5.0,"The author doesn't aim to inspire. It's a dose of hard truth of what living in the margins is really like. It makes you think. It makes you ponder your personal privilege. The author does a good job, in my opinion of navigating some pretty tough topics in such a way that makes it readable. This is not trauma porn although the author has experienced plenty of trauma in her life. It takes a great deal of talent to weave an essay back and forth through timelines, while keep the reader focused, entertained and ultimately able to wrap their heads around the theme."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Sarah,"April 18, 2021",5.0,"First to touch upon the Twitter/Goodreads controversy: I only review books that I've read from start to finish, and believe that doing otherwise takes the value away from this website. I also think that anyone who reads this book—which is centrally about the author's PTSD, anger, mental illness, and ongoing difficulty with human interaction—and is then surprised when the author is a jerk on Twitter, might want to reflect on who ""deserves"" to be an author and what the proper punishment for being a jerk on the internet is. Finally: I think female-identifying authors are often punished for doing anything outside of being thankful and nice and polite, and that sucks. I also think that authors from different/blue collar backgrounds are often seen as assholes by the writing/reviewing community just because they do not know the proper rules of engagement, and it's a form of class gatekeeping.

On to the actual review of the book:

From the first paragraph, we are introduced to a very unreliable narrator (she tells us on the first page that she LIES) who also happens to be extremely unlikable (there is a long list of unlikable things about her that I won't spend time on). And our first instinct is to push her away and question everything she says. And honestly, even after finishing the book, I'm not sure what exactly in the memoir is true or false. And honestly, even after loving the book, I don't think she's likable.

But she can write. And she can process very difficult emotions, and talk about humanity in a fresh way that can make your heart hurt. And she is extremely, extremely funny. This is the rare memoir that is a page-turner/stay-up-past-your-bedtime read that is also a smart and fresh commentary on society, religion, sexuality, class, and ultimately a person's place in the world.

Many parts are painful and difficult to read. It seems obvious in places that the author still has a lot of processing and reflecting to do about the stories she tells. It's rough around the edges. But her heart is out there, and she's trying. She's incredibly vulnerable, and even if we're not sure, for example, if she set fire to her own car, she makes us understand that there's a lot more to it than that.

Lauren Hough has been through the unthinkable. She never had the chance to learn to be human or ""normal"" the way that most of us did. The result is a ton of pain, monkeys still on her back, and enough self-doubt and confusion to sink a ship. But the result is also this completely unique survivor who built herself from the ground up and found success and meaning after a truly strange and incredible journey. She's far, far from perfect (how could anyone be?) but her book is pretty close. It's fun and heartbreaking. It pushes you away and then brings you closer. It makes you confront your beliefs. It makes you wonder if you should be a bouncer in a gay bar after all or follow your dream to be a cable guy. Mostly, though, it sharpens your empathy and see the world from a totally new angle, if just for a few hundred pages."
Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing,Sarah Bloom,"August 13, 2021",5.0,"I discovered Lauren Hough on Twitter a year or so ago, probably through Roxane Gay. I immediately liked her. Something about women who really don't give a fuck is very appealing to me. I saw she had a book coming out and made note. I saw the kerfuffle on Twitter over her comments on the 4-star review and all I have to say about that is people are fucking idiots and should lighten the hell up.

Now to the book.

It did not disappoint. The writing is raw and accessible but not dumbed down. Her stories tell us about her history in a cult, her coming out story and her persistent feeling of being ""other,"" something that ironically most of us can relate to. More than that, her stories amplify a swath of America that people not living it do not understand: The working poor. Hough illustrates well how this country is set up against poor people. The fantasy of pulling oneself up by their boot straps is just that - fantasy.

I highly recommend this book to everyone. There are lines that hit you in the gut and lines that sing. Lauren's humor and sardonic wit may not be for everyone, but I'm here for it."
The Kid,Les,"October 6, 2022",3.0,"I'm not sure why Sapphire insists on writing her characters at the absolute expense of the reader's patience. I disagree with those who rated this book with one or no stars because it wasn't ""hopeful"" like Push. How in the WORLD can anyone think Push was hopeful? Because she learned to read and hate herself a little less? That's supposed to be hopeful? Please! It wasn't. I also think it's rather self-indulgent and a bit ridiculous to expect the protagonist of this novel to become someone who didn't victimize others. Seriously? Are you paying attention? What in his experience would lead him to be a good person? The answer is nothing and in the end, no one. By the end of the first chapter, it's clear that this manchild (think Bigger Thomas in today's modern DCFS system)is going to have a horrific life. It can not be avoided. The forces were in motion long before he was born.

And so it is. Sapphire's writing in The Kid is similar to that of Push. The hero (who is also an anti-hero, but not as much of an antagonistic ""figure"" as the world he encounters)narrates, or rather his stream of consciousness narrates the story. It is straightforward, graphic, disgusting and honest. To say it's hard to read is an understatement. Sapphire likes to bruise the mind of her reader - perhaps to mimic the experience of her main characters. Whatever the motivation, it's effective, manipulative and enraging. At certain points, I had to walk away from the book. This happened with Push, but to a lesser degree since it had few pages to get through. From my own experience with the world of foster kids, group homes and the like, a lot of it rings true in the most sickening way. The stories of foster teens in the newspapers and magazines are nearly always of the exceptions. The rule of what it's like to be warehoused is much worse than anything she could write. People who want to read about a character in the protagonist's situation and come out feelin' ""hopeful"" have a fundamental misunderstanding of what Sapphire and anyone who has worked with and for these children knows. (I'm not saying all are sexually victimized, but many are at some point and the emotional mindf*@k of it all is pretty much across the board.)

That's my defense of her work, but I admit to struggling between giving it two stars or three. The possibility of four or five is out of the question. While there are several poignant lines, observations, epiphanies and concepts throughout the book, they are BURIED in countless pages and scenes that waste the reader's time while insulting his/her intellect. I accepted early on that it would be told in a convoluted way that blended reality with fantasy and confusion, because that's how this kid experiences and processes life. If you pay attention, it becomes clear when he's correctly identified reality and when it's a dream or fantasy. Still, there was FAR TOO MUCH OF IT! This book could have been 100 pages shorter. There was no need to repeat things so often or to drag out a point and then beat it to death before then giving it a literary funeral. I GOT it! It was as if Sapphire didn't trust me to understand some of the deeper issues and conflicts. The more pornographic scenes went from being uncomfortable (almost shocking unless you know what unsupervised and angry, disconnected boys can do to one another when no one's watching) to annoying and then actually boring because there were so many of them and they were drawn out. You really have to wear a person down to make them insensitive to that.

This book is still a powerful statement and the whole monster-like/rapist Oliver Twist tale would make an excellent book club discussion and provide some challenging points/questions to those who even at their best, underserve this population every day. Still, I didn't need to have 10 to 20 pages about the background of side characters because the author wanted to further make a point. I didn't need to have the final portion of the book be a forced mystery just to end as flatly as Push did. Even so, you get the sense that whatever horror and revulsion you experience by reading this pales in comparison to that of kids who encounter any portion of this guy's experience. He enters a lamb, becomes a monster and then ends up being a damaged combination that has no true place in the standard society.

I did appreciate having my eyes opened, but I'm over Saphhire's brand of then throwing acid into the reader's eyes and asking, ""Don't that hurt?"" Yes, it does. This is the second and final time I'll read a novel by her. Won't do it again, but don't regret it."
The Kid,Shannon,"July 27, 2011",1.0,"This book is awful. It takes the kitchen sink approach used in Push (everything bad that can happen to the protagonist does.) But in The Kid, Sapphire removes the heart and characterization that made Push shine in spite of the bleakness of the subject matter.

Abdul is a cipher. His motivations are a mystery. And while the opening sequence broke my heart, I quickly lost sympathy as Abdul grew into a sociopath and rapist. He is a monster, and impossible to root for. His supporting characters fare no better, mostly victims and victimizers.

Sapphire overused poorly delineated dream sequences in the narrative, often obscuring her intent. I am done with the book and not entirely clear on what really happened. Unreliable narrator stories need more than others for the author to have a clear idea of where they're going and a firm grasp on the big picture. The Kid had neither.

Sapphire also piled on abuse and rape scenarios beyond the point of plausibility or utility to the story. There are at least ten rapes in the book. As the abuse piled up, it began to feel cheap and exploitive.

I cannot recommend this book for anyone. It features many intense depictions of rape. The stream of consciousness style and frequent dream sequences make the narrative hard to follow. And in the end, there was no point to all the suffering. Just a story about a broken abuse victim who grew up to be an unrepentant rapist and murderer."
The Kid,Karyl,"July 27, 2011",2.0,"What a terrible, awful book. It's not the writing. Sapphire's writing is amazing. But Abdul is such a terrible, unlikeable, awful person. And being in his head is so disturbing and unsettling, and that is why this is such a terrible book.

My friend Kassie wrote a review over on BlogHer that I agree with completely. This is nothing more I can add to what she's put so well. Please visit her review here.

As Kassie put it, ""[T]hese lessons don’t make for easy reads. This is not a book I would read a second time. This is a book that I will pass from friend to friend, encouraging them to read it because they should, but not because they will enjoy it. To read it out of obligation to the thousands and thousands of children in our foster care system and the thousands and thousands of men and women in prisons and mental hospitals. Read it to have a better understanding of how and why people make the decisions they do and end up where they do, read it because as you sit in your clean, safe home, a little boy somewhere is in jeopardy. And you should care about that. Even if it hurts."""
The Kid,Lori Anaple,"October 10, 2011",4.0,"It amazes me that many reviewers of this book are disappointed because this work isn't uplifting, hopeful, redeeming, etc. It further astounds me that readers feel as though The Kid ""rapes the memory of Push"".

First, these are two separate books. Yes, there is a bond between them of Precious, but she is not a living, breathing character in The Kid. She is alive only as much as she is remembered by Abdul/JJ. This is not her story, it is her son's.

I, personally, don't find Push that uplifting. But this review is about The Kid, and it is a rough read. I find that Sapphire's stream of consciousness narrative enables the reader to live what Abdul lives. It doesn't always make sense. It isn't always real. It is just how he is perceiving the moment. The reader is on his ride, in his mind and it isn't always comfortable or pretty. In fact, it is rarely pretty and is downright ugly most of the time.

I haven't seen a review yet that has solely reviewed this one work. Most are juxtaposed with the story of Precious. I can totally understand that. It practically begs to be compared, yet it can stand alone. Where we see Precious rise against odds in Push, we see her son sink. It begs the question of Nature vs Nurture for me. What would his life have been like if Precious would have lived? She certainly was trying to make a different life for her son. In a way she succeeded because Abdul is so angry at the life he leads (which is directly correlated with his Mother's) because she raised him to expect more. She gave him the ability to hope. She gave him the ability to dream and dare to assume that he will be a success.

All of that is ripped away when he becomes orphaned. He grows up abused and is returned to the cycle of violence that Precious fought so hard to escape. It is hard to watch him endure the atrocities that he does. It is hard to see him perpetrate onto others what has been done to him. It is bizarre to be in his heard, seeing how he justifies his actions, perceives his reality - actually believes his abuse is wanted.

We all wonder ""at what point do we stop crying for the child and start hating what he has become"". This book shoves that question in the reader's face and makes us examine it.

I also find it interesting that at one point Abdul is told that he is like his mother in the respect that Precious used to stare and fixate into space. The physical abuse his mother suffered is very similar to the abuse that Abdul suffered in the first foster home.

I have read many reviews which talked about how there was too much narrative for extraneous characters. I don't see any characters that are extraneous. I find them all central to the psyche of Abdul. In the beginning we are introduced to Rita. She is an important figure for Abdul. She represents the descent of the ladder of love that Abdul is on.

The book fell apart for me at the end. I am left with so much confusion as to what the hell happened. Perhaps that is the point.

Apologies for the scattered review. I just finished this book 1/2 hour ago and it is ruminating in my mind. I think it will be with me for a long time. This isn't a book you will reread. This isn't a book you will enjoy reading. It is a book that needs to be read."
The Kid,Ashley,"October 16, 2011",1.0,"This IS a DNF book, and the full length explanation of why I chose to set this one aside was originally written up for my blog, Books from Bleh to Basically Amazing.

The Kid by Sapphire is a novel I really should have liked. I read and reviewed Push on the blog last year (click to read my review) and while I can't say that I loved the book, I definitely understood the point and was left with an overall feeling of purpose. The Kid, however, did not leave me feeling any of that. I am not going to give this an official review, since I didn't actually finish reading it, but I am going to leave you with my thoughts and explain why this was a book I found myself unable to complete.

Note- this review is going to contain spoilers for the first half of the book. I really struggle with not finishing books. I read quickly so it's usually not a big deal to push through a book I'm not loving. So for me to have really put this one down, I feel like I owe a thorough explanation. You have been warned.

The thing is, I tried. Really I did. I had every intention of finishing the book, even after I realized I wasn't enjoying it. In all honesty, if this hadn't been a review book I probably would have made the DNF decision somewhere between pages 5 and 50. I knew that early that this wasn't going to be a book I'd enjoy. But, because this is a review book and I felt terrible not finishing I ended up making it to page 207 before finally admitting defeat and admitting that I just...wasn't going to be able to do it. I intend to identify the scene that finally pushed me over the edge, but I want to talk a little more about the book before I do that.

One of my main complaints in my review of Push is what I felt to be an extreme level of graphic content. I said, ""Although it is important for the direction of the story that we understand Precious has been abused both sexually and emotionally, I did not then, and do not now feel that the level of description was necessary. Some of the specific details the author included seemed in place merely for the shock and horror value."" That feeling is amplified in The Kid. Extremely amplified. I honestly feel like Sapphire sat down and asked herself about all the hard, rough, graphic and extreme stuff she could possibly add to a story like this and then added it into the story. -Just add graphic rape, stir in a bit of cussing and VIOLA! Instant edge.

The story is told by Abdul (also called J.J.), Precious's son. And the narrative is incredibly difficult to follow. I don't know if that's because Sapphire is female and unsure how to write an authentic young boy character (something I strongly suspect...) or where it is merely her writing style. But I felt such a strong detachment and disconnect from the story I found myself completely unable to care about the story or Abdul. Even in the very beginning of the story, before we realize that Abdul is going to pass along the abuse he receives while in the system, I didn't care about him. And for serious- Who can't care about a nine year old boy?! Abdul has all these strange and very violent thoughts, where he screams in his mind things like Crazy Ass Roach Bitch and F*cking Bitch and on and on. And I wasn't always sure if he's only thinking these things or when they actually cross over into actual speech or actions. This is especially noticeable in the 13 year old section, but is also present in the beginning, when he's only nine. So, the story starts the day of him mother's funeral and Abdul is sent into the system. A boy in his first foster home rapes and severely beats him, landing him in the hospital for 3 weeks. They then decide to send him to a Catholic orphanage where two of the priests rape him on a regular basis. So, J.J. decides to return the favor and he rapes other boys in the orphanage. After being kicked out of the orphanage, for reasons that are a bit sketchy (unreliable narrator and as mentioned before, very awkward and detached narration) Abdul/J.J. is sent to live with the great-grandmother who should have been taking care of him for the last 4 years. But the priest at the orphanage decided he liked Abdul and wanted to keep him close. (barf)

This is where I finally accepted that this book wasn't for me, that I was going to have to call it quits on the story because I just couldn't stomach it or believe it anymore. I finally gave it up after listening to page after page after page after page of his great-grandmother describing, in graphic detail to a 13 year old boy how she had been raped at the age of ten, gave birth to his grandmother, ran away from home and ended up living and working in a whore house. Graphic detail. To a 13 year old. I was disturbed but still pushing through... And then- In the middle of this disturbing and inappropriate story from great-grandma, Abdul decides he is going to teach her a lesson, he decides he's going to really 'show' her. So he pulls his pants off and proceeds to masturbate to the point of orgasm while g-gma is still talking. He's 13 and he thinks that jacking off in front of his grandma is a good idea... Really? Really?! SERIOUSLY?!

I read a few pages past this but just couldn't do it anymore. I get that he's had a crappy life. Really, I do. I get that his life experiences are so far from mine that I can't possibly understand what he's gone through or what he feels. But I also felt that Sapphire failed her job as a writer, because she didn't write the book in a way that allowed me to understand or sympathize with Abdul. I was never able to understand his thoughts, his motives, anything. And I never cared to either.

Normally, in a book like this, I can find something good to say about the story. And I tried, really I did. I don't mind telling you what I don't like about a book, but I really like having something positive to say about the book as well. But, I have nothing. I was unable to find a single redeeming quality. I can't even say that the author's motives were pure or acceptable, because I can't figure out what they were.

And, I'm worried that given the nature of the book, given the subject matter this tries to tackle that people are going to be hesitant to say anything bad about it. I can see it. And I know that there are some people out there who will genuinely like this book. I get that. I know that not every book is for every reader. But I also believe that this book is going to be getting more praise than it deserves because no one wants to say something bad about a book like this. But you know what, there are great books out there that handle the topic of abuse. Great writers that manage to give credibility to their characters, their situations and their reactions, whether positive or not. In my opinion, Sapphire is not one of them.

Maybe some of you will be interested in this book. Maybe you will be better able to make sense of the jumbled and confused mess that is Abdul's narration. If so, I'd love to hear from you, love to hear what you think. But for the most part, this is not a book I would ever recommend."
The Kid,Connie Kuntz,"August 16, 2011",5.0,"Once again, Sapphire put me through pure reading hell and once again, it was totally worth it! If you can stand reading page after page of violence and rape and manipulation, you will be rewarded with a new understanding of the cycle of rage and rape. Maybe that doesn't sound appealing, but I promise you The Kid is an enriching read.

The Kid follows Abdul (AKA JJ) from age 9 to about 19. He is at best, an antihero, who is possessed by sexual demons and night terrors as well as a deep appreciation for earth science, literature and dance. Especially dance.

There is deep, artistic redemption, love, and hope in this story, but the most important lessons from this book are to judge less, build trust more and to never give up.

I think it is crucial that anyone who considers him or herself non-judgmental read this book. The sooner we learn about how important it is to establish trust within our own families, the better our society will be.

Bummer for me: There are too many ads in the book, especially for Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, McDonald's and Burger King. I can't stand getting absorbed into a story only to be interrupted by obnoxious ads for a greedy corporations. Note to self: boycott those jerks, especially Starbucks. I thought by now I would be used to product placement in the newer novels, but I am not. The ads call attention to themselves in a negative way. I can barely tolerate this nonsense in film and television. When it comes to reading, the ads cheapen the literature big time. What is next? Starbucks logos embedded in oil paintings?

I can't let this go. If I am not being clear about how I feel about the product placement in the novels, take the following for an example: A new artist paints disturbing but compelling images. Her art depict the horrors, realities and wonders of a sexually abused child. You find yourself learning about that child's journey and you can feel your mind opening to hoping and healing not only that child, but the children of future generations. Then you notice a Starbucks logo embedded in the landscape. Does this enrich or cheapen the artistic experience?

The Kid,Misshaq,"September 19, 2011",4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this book but overall am going to give it a very good rating. Sapphire is a writer, she takes the reader through alot of emotions as we follow the hellish life of Precious son, Abdul. At the age of nine, Precious dies from HIV and life changes forever for her son. He goes from boarding with a friend of Precious to a foster home. While in the home he suffers abuse and after an injury lands him in the hospital, he is taken to St. Ailanthus, a Catholic orphanage. There he endures the most horrific, sexual, physical, mental, abuse a human can experience. It is at times unimaginable that anyone would go through that type of abuse.

Abdul, also called JJ, was only supposed to be in the home temporarily but ends up living there for five years. It is during that time, that Abdul abuses other little boys, the way that he was abused. After an investigation, he is kicked out of the school. When he gets kicked out, his great grandmother surfaces and claims him. But where was she all along? One of the mysteries that later unravels. It comes to light that Abdul, or JJ was supposed to go live with his grandmother (remember Precious mother) and her mother when his mother first died. But he ends up ""lost"" in the foster care system and that is how he ends up at the Catholic terror zone. When he learns all of this, he goes crazy as anyone would. The only thing keeping him sane is his love for dance. He first becomes exposed while at school. When he decides to run away from his great grandmother he then gets ""taken in"" by an older dancer who exploits him, again sexually and emotionally abusing him. Abdul lives there until he becomes an adult. O

One of the issues I found most chilling about this book is how he ends up getting ""lost"" so many times. The foster care system didn't know he was in the Catholic home, they had him listed as dead. His grandmother and living relatives never pressed hard to find out where he was. So he was left with these gaping holes in his history. Those questions, who am I? Where do I come from? Who is my father, how did my mother really die haunted him. That, mixed with the abuse he endured left him a shattered soul. Yet there was another side to him, he was a smart boy, good at math, good at art, literature and science. One can only wonder what he could have become had he had a loving person to guide him and nurture his mind and body instead of take advantage of him.

I know many of the reviews of this book are not good, and people don't feel the same level of empathy and compassion for Abdul that they did for Precious, mainly because Abdul becomes a purpratrator himself. But I do feel for Abdul and as I read the book I just thought about all of the orphan kids out there who don't have anyone to protect them. Protect, and Love and Guide, and Nurture.

In the introduction of the book it is written that there are 16 million orphans around the world, as a result of the HIV epidemic. This book tells the story of what can happen when our most vulnerable and helpless are left in the wrong hands and how the cycle of abuse continues.

I pray we can find a way to slow down the spread of HIV and one day eradicate it. I pray that we can protect the future generation from abuse in all of its forms. I thank Sapphire for bringing light to these important issues."
The Kid,Bobbie Grob,"May 7, 2013",1.0,"This is the absolute worst, most nauseatingly horrific book I have ever read. I'd give it negative stars if I could. This is the story of Precious Jones' son, and while her story of abuse and her rise above it was inspiring and heart-wrenching, this was no more than a glorification of pedophilia and sexual abuse.

It is no surprise that many victims turn perpetrator when they are finally big enough to dominate others, but the protagonist seemed to revel in his abuse, take pride in what he did to others, and overall just pat himself on the back for being a monster.

The stream of consciousness style of writing was disjointed and confusing at best, and at worst it was nightmare-inducing. There were such an overwhelming number of scenes where rape and violence were prevalent that I am still heartsick at having read through them.

I kept waiting for the moment when Abdul would rise above himself and learn from his mistakes. I waded through page after page of depravity, and that redemption never came. I was as enraged by the end of the book as I was at the beginning.

I have not only wasted my time with this filth, but I now see terrible images when I close my eyes at night. Sapphire could write the most wonderful book the world has ever seen for her next project, but I will never again give my time or my money to anything that has her name on it, ever."
The Kid,Roberta,"July 8, 2012",1.0,"I read Push for a class. While I can't say I would have ever voluntarily picked it up, I lost count of how many times I looked up a passage for the paper I was writing and found myself, yet again, at the end of the book. This, however, I just didn't care for. I picked it up at the library, largely because Sapphire had created such a compelling character in Precious that I really wanted to know what happened next, seeing as how this was the sequel and all. I have to admit that it really bothered me that a woman who had been through so much and took so much time and effort to turn her life around and be the best possible mother for her son, knowing that she had HIV, apparently never gave a thought to what would happen to that son she after she was gone. (I get that grandma wasn't an option - I wouldn't, either - but deliberately dooming a child to a life of foster care bothers me. A lot.) I can't fault her for not sharing her son's history with him (some things are just too much for a 9 year old to handle) but right from the get-go, it's pretty clear that this is not going to end well.

I stuck with it, even after deciding I just plain don't like Abdul...or perhaps it's merely the way Sapphire writes from a male perspective. I slogged through Toosie's narrative...and by the time My Lei was telling her story, I realized I was skimming more than actually reading. With Push, I genuinely cared about Precious, and something in her story resonated with me. The Kid was the polar opposite in that I couldn't find a shred of empathy for any of the characters. I found myself longing for the brief snippets of journal entries that Push had offered, or some other storytelling device that would somehow make me care about these characters.

Don't even get me started on the fourth part of the book, which was utterly perplexing and left me wondering what on earth I had just read. ""Loose ends"" is beyond an understatement. I like books that leave me with questions and stick in my head for months afterward. This was a situation where the ending was unresolved, and quite frankly, that pissed me off, since that was the sole reason I'd stuck with it - the hope of some (any!) resolution to some (any!) part of the narrative.

Quite frankly, after writing a 10 page paper on Langston Hughes this past semester, I found myself spending more time drawing parallels between Hughes and the various events and characters of The Kid than I did processing or getting emotionally invested in the novel. I would say that perhaps that's the brain training of an English major, save that I don't typically have that issue except with novels I can't engage with.

Ultimately, what I was looking for was to find out that Precious had been a good mom (she was), what had happened to the other girls from Each One Teach One (which we only get a tiny glimpse of), and that Abdul had ended up with a better future than his mother (he didn't), and I'm glad to be moving on to something else...which makes me sad, since Push was such a compelling novel, and this simply wasn't."
The Kid,Eris,"July 2, 2011",3.0,"I'm going to be completely honest here. This book needs to simmer for a while longer before it is published. The base story is incredible, the ride is harrowing - but it loses a lot of it's power in some of the scatter.

Written in first person, as was ""Push"", you are taken right into the mind of her son right after she dies. He is young, he is swept into a foster home with little understanding of the implications or his future or why he can't have his stuff. He is dissociated on his mother's death, thinking of her as still alive.

Then a violent act occurs. We wake up in a hospital. We skip from there over to the boy's home he is taken to, and the horrible things Abdul does there. You only know he has suffered those same horrible things done to himself if you are familiar with traumatic stress and how victims act out - it isn't until much later in the story that we are let in on the original abuses done at the home. This DOES make the story suffer a lot, as does her treatment of his pleasure during raping his fellow wards. You hear his internal voice of great pleasure as he takes them - you don't hear any pain in that moment, you know he's fucked up but the set up leads you to believe maybe it's from brain damage or some mental illness. This is the part of the book that I'd like to see revisited, refined, and made more consistent and clear for the reader.

In the younger years, his voice changes a few times - suddenly more educated than he is, or suddenly less educated than he is. This makes his character hard to follow, hard to buy into.

The central section is awesome, but the final wrap up feels cheap, forced - like there needed to be a way to end the book. It might serve better to split it into two and tell the story a little more thoroughly with less jumping.

Again, a great idea, I did get something out of it, but I think it is lacking in too many places and should be delayed in publication if the author really wants to get her voice across. Having lived with, known, been around many victims of traumatic sexual and familial and foster abuse, I think the story is worth telling right."
The Kid,Kori ☾,"June 5, 2017",1.0,"SPOILERS AHEAD

Just like his father/grandfather and his great grandfather, Abdul becomes a rapist but constantly denies he is anything but a great kid. I like that Sapphire shed a light on his great grandmother because we can see that the system failed that entire family. Here is a mini flow chart:

-

Tootsie Johnston - Originally from the south and was abandoned by her mother. Was raped at the age of 9/10 and gave birth to Mary. Not loving towards Mary in anyway and even tried to kill her once. Named her Mary after her aunt or mother I forgot but didn't want to name her Mary. Was a prostitute for some time.

↓

Mary L. Johnston - Not much is known about her past. Died weighing close to 500 lbs, a product of rape, raped her own daughter, and allowed her boyfriend to rape her child.

↓

Claireece Precious Jones - Has two children with her father, who began to rape her at a young age. Her mother ignores the abuse and eventually begins to abuse her as well. Despite all of her hurdles she was able to get her GED and get herself into college.

↓

Abdul Jamal Louis Jones - Pathological liar, the product of rape, a smart man, prone to being nasty, closed off, can dance well, becomes a predator.

-

This novel was trash, just torture porn honestly. I couldn't identify with Abdul. If you're going to abuse people don't deny it once its one. The writing was well because Sapphire is an excellent writer but Abdul was such a weak man (IRONIC BECAUSE HIS MOTHER WANTED TO NAME HIM AFTER STRONG MEN). What a sick book, Push didn't have a happy ending but at least Precious is trying to overcome and better herself. What is Abdul doing? Raping children and saying hes a great person. I honestly wish I never spent money on this book."
The Kid,Amo A,"February 26, 2012",,"Worst. Book. Ever?
The Kid, which I had to FORCE myself to finish, gets zero stars. I'm stunned to discover it had an editor, the story was so bad. If I could be the editor now that it's published (inexplicably), here would be some of my notes:
1. Consider making at least one of the characters likable. Like maybe the main character.
2. Consider making at least one of the characters a non-cliche.
3. The kid's great-grandmother barely talks to him his whole life and then lays out her life story for him in 20 rambling pages? And he jacks off in the middle of it and the two of them just continue on like nothing happened? Really???
4. Number 3 isn't the only unbelievable thing about this story. You know the phrase ""too much of a good thing""? Well the same goes for bad things. After a while, I stop buying all the horror.
5. Why, with the ballet kids? They're boring, and the whole section with them seems like name-dropping, only with cultural references instead of names.
6. The ending? WTF???
The only hope I have for this book is that it's so nonsensical and ridiculous because Sapphire was attempting to illustrate just how messed up a kid's brain and life can be when his father is also his mother's father. I'm pretty sure that's not what she was doing, since there's no insight even remotely close to that, but I want to believe there's SOME sort of justification for what I just read. Bleh."
The Kid,Kelly,"August 12, 2011",3.0,"I am forever scarred from reading this book. I have read many books in my life, but none have caused me so much pain, anguish, and terror as this one. I loved Push because despite the horror of Precious' life, the ending was uplifting and hopeful. This, book, however provides nothing but agony and damage. Why Sapphire would choose to create a life like this for Precious' son is beyond belief. I know that I cannot be the only reader who questions Sapphire's motives for writing this book; she has destroyed all vestiges of hope and redemption found in Push.

Despite the grueling process of reading this book, I could not put it down. Yes, I know Abdul's story rings true for too many children in his circumstances, but Sapphire makes him into such a deplorable monster that it negates much of the sympathy I want to feel for him because of what was done to him. The sex scenes are so prevalent and so revolting that it's hard to recommend this book to others. Unlike his mother, Abdul has no true identity (his constant name changes highlight this), but he does have a thirst for knowledge which Sapphire uses to pepper the novel with his monologue ramblings of historical facts and literary references. If this is supposed to endear us to Abdul more, it does not. And even Abdul's love of dance is just a copycat (and lazy technique by Sapphire) of his mother's love of writing which SAVES her. Alas, nothing saves Abdul. Sapphire had to know that this book would alienate her from many of her fans.

I do not hate this book, but I am upset over its many flaws and disappointed in Sapphire. Yes, I like the stream of consciousness feel to it and the uncomfortable, uneasy feelings that the dream sequences (what is real and what is not) instilled in me. But as for a coming of age story of a strong willed young man who overcomes adversity as some reviewers have called this, all I can say is, did they read the same book I did? Abdul is abused by everyone and he abuses others in return.

This book will haunt me for the rest of my life. If that was Sapphire's intent, then she has succeeded with me on that one point."
The Kid,Susan,"February 9, 2012",2.0,"Hard to believe, but this was more violent, more sickening, more bleak than it's predecessor ""Push"". I was horrified in the beginning and then angry and finally depressed by The Kid's story. In my work as an RN and Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) I touched on the nightmare lived by children in ""the system""; the abuse and neglect and torture they suffered first from blood-family and then from foster-family. Family history and individual identity become too horrific to live with. These damaged children grow into irretrievably damaged adults who repeat the horror in a never-ending spiral leading to suicide, homicide, or Death Row, leaving a trail of more damaged children in their wake. Bleak. Very Bleak. More so because it reads so true. So how do I rate this book? I can't say I ""liked"" it or ""loved"" it. I can say that reading it deeply affected me. It requires a completely different rating system. Here's a quote from the first Chapter Heading. The quote is by Flannery O'Connor (from ""Wise Blood""), but it describes The Kid's dilemma: ""Where you come from is gone, where you thought you were going never was there, and where you are is no good unless you get away from it."""
The Kid,Linds,"December 3, 2011",2.0,"This is the bleakest book I've ever read. Bar none. The author doesn't just break your heart. She rips it out of your chest, stamps it with her boot, and then rubs your face in it. There's not a glimmer of hope, no hint of redemption. Just ugliness.

The book starts with Precious dying of AIDS, and Abdul taken to foster care where he is repeatedly physically and sexually abused. In graphic detail. Over and over again.

More disturbing is that Abdul himself becomes an abuser and rapist against other boys. In graphic detail. Over and over again.

It is double disturbing because it is Precious' child. All her struggle, all her abuse was for nothing because Abdul was her hope.

I get that the point is that abuse begats abuse, but it was just too much for me."
The Kid,Timothy,"January 15, 2013",1.0,"This book is so excessive in its endless rape scenarios that add nothing to anything. No character is even remotely likeable or redeemable in remotely any way. I think Sapphire saw how people enjoyed the depressing grittiness of the first book, and then, to cash in on the movie, she decided to see how far she could push the envelope. What made Push endearing was Precious's desire (and success?) to break the cycle. This was apparently for nothing, though, as her son becomes one of the most depraved characters in history... really cheapens her efforts in Push."
The Kid,Marquina,"September 7, 2011",3.0,"Still reeling from this book. Interestingly enough, I feel I have a better understanding for the fluidity, repetitiveness and paranoia of an insane persons' thoughts. The writing *is* excellent, but it is a mentally exhausting read. Sapphire definitely has a gift, but I would not recommend THE KID to anyone without warning them about the disturbing content. Before reading THE KID, I had heard it was a story about a dancer with a troubled past. I love dance, and can handle 'troubled' stories - or so I thought. It turns out he not only was an incredibly damaged/damaging youth, but also a disturbing preadolescent-through-adolescent-through-the end? Everyone used and abuses J.J/ Abdul; he comes to expect it from teachers, friends, parent-figures, doctors, etc. He uses and abuses others - even children - without remorse, because he has no basis to understand his actions. As the story progresses J.J./Abdul becomes increasingly violent, and relates to everyone with suspicion, if he relates at all. The dance portion of the story is shrouded by many disappointing, ultra-violent, sexually explicit and damaging events in the characters' life that, as a reader, you feel the character is always barely treading water in the sea of his life. The final chapters were disorienting, to say the least as neither Abdul - now nineteen, or is it twenty? - nor the other characters in whateverplaceheendsupin can explain the exact chain of events. Finally, at the end of the book, the door is left open. Or so we think. We are told the door will be open, but will it? Are we sure? There are so many disappointments, that we can not expect what characters say to be true. At the half-way read point, I begun to wish Sapphire would kill-off THE KID at the end. I couldn't think of another ending; but of course I'm no author or storyteller. J.J./Abdul is violent and couldn't control his impulses, except when dancing; in control ONLY while focusing on the rigor of dance. I think the story is left open because Sapphire plans to write a third book; I won't be reading it. Well, maybe I'll skim the summary. Thing is, I was wrapped by the story and hoped something, anything would work out for J.J./Abdul without also carrying disappointment. I'm curious about what will happen next, even if I metaphorically want to 'cover my eyes'."
The Kid,Melanie,"December 22, 2011",2.0,"The Kid was a book that of course, was highly advertised as an ""epic follow up to Push"", (the acclaimed story of ""Precious"" and her struggles).
I received this book as a birthday gift and eagerly tore into the pages expecting a harrowing tale of a boy left orphaned by the death of his HIV+ mother and a journey of growth and struggle escaping the ghetto life he was destined for.

Instead, this book disappointed me, disgusted me and even made me shut the pages and put the book down several times. There is nothing wrong with adding a little descriptive sexual horror or straining violence to accentuate a point but to pepper every page with poor grammar and intrusive sexual pedophilia for pure shock value crosses the line.

Sapphire tries to open the readers eyes to a boy thrown into foster care without love or reason and wants us to attach or feel for this character. Truth be told, not once do you have the opportunity to connect with this character. He is short spoken and the threads that hold reality and fiction together strain the story line. In many cases, you are actually rooting against the main character, Abdul JJ, as he rapes, molests and violates young boys throughout the story.

As an honest closing statement, read the book if you are interested in just knowing what the book is all about. Do not expect to connect with the characters or long for them well after you close the pages. In fact, it is relieving to close the back cover and know that it is all over. The book could have really brought to light some intense troubles that do exist in foster homes and Catholic boarding homes, but instead Sapphire withheld this critical emotional connection from the readers. I'm not even sure what I'm going to do with this book other than sell it on Amazon, I cannot imagine even lending this book to any friend or family member. It's that disturbing."
The Kid,Andrial Durant,"May 3, 2018",1.0,"Original Review : I can describe this book in four words: THAT NIGGA IS CRAZY.

Updated Review : I felt compelled to come back update this review and really explain why I gave a one star. First, I read the book and watched the movie Precious and I was sadden that both her mother and father had victimized her and after she build her self up and was trying to better herself she was plagued with that incurable disease. So when I found out the author Sapphire did another book from the perspective of the son I was excited. I couldn’t wait to read and find out if Precious son continued his mother fight. I was expecting to hear a great turn of events........this was not it. Even within the first few chapters I was horrified, grossed and disturbed by what I was reading and yet I didn’t stop reading. I kept reading hoping that it would get better, it’s gonna get better, there is more and it will be better......it never did. It got worst and worst and worst. I said in my original review that I’m four words “this nigga is crazy” but what I should have said is that no only is he crazy, but he is nasty, a sociopath but is also a perpetrator of the same crimes that his grandmother and grandfather-father imposed upon Precious but yet he is doing it to other. If I could put no stars I would have. Sapphire did not need to continue the precious story she should have left it as one book."
The Kid,Carla,"July 20, 2011",2.0,"This book was really hard to read. Part of the problem that it was raw, gritty and exceptionally profane with graphic abuse, that was to be expected after Push (only The Kid is way more so). The main issue is that in 374 pages about 200 are just rambling. The story line goes in some strange directions and you never really know much. In Push Sapphire told a heartbreaking but well conceived story. In The Kid she goes from real and thought provoking to existential babble, any sort of realness (and there is some) gets buried."
The Kid,Elizabeth,"July 13, 2011",1.0,"This book was the follow up to Push and I just didn't get it. I still don't quite know if I could explain what happened in this book. It seemed like it was written to shock with language and content and that really turned me off. The level of crudity didn't seem to be needed, and I'm not easily put off by that stuff. The story was just a downer that got even more down which, again, I feel wasn't warranted."
The Kid,Loes,"August 2, 2012",2.0,"I like the subject, but I think it was executed very poorly. There were a lot of boring, slow parts (like going through a whole dance sequence) that added nothing to the story. Also, there were parts where it wasn't clear what was happening at all. I didn't read the whole book. I stopped around 3/4 of it."
The Kid,Carrie,"April 29, 2016",3.0,"Clearly, one of the most disturbing stories I have ever read.
The writing was tricky to say the least, the story jumped all over and there were too many run-on thoughts for my liking.
I love agonizing stories. This delivered. But not really my style."
The Kid,Tif,"January 27, 2019",1.0,"I am unfortunately not able to finish this one at this time. I am just not able to handle the content at this difficult time in my own life. Maybe I will try it again later, or maybe not."
The Kid,Vic,"October 15, 2020",2.0,"trigger warning for rape // I started this book because Push by Sapphire is one of my favorite novels in the world. I read it when I was a bit too young, but this year, at 23, I reread it and enjoyed it wholeheartedly (and no just because there were bad words in it, one of the only things I would’ve appreciated as a kid). I went into The Kid under this premise — This is the sequel to Push, I know that Precious, beloved and misguided, is dead in this reiteration of the book, but surely her son Abdul, as he is not illiterate like his mother, has some more profound things to say.

No, he surely doesn’t. Not at all.

I love the psychological horror that Sapphire’s writing puts the reader through. I love the stream of consciousness, and the graphic nature of her books in general, as Sapphire is perhaps one of my biggest influences as a result of reading her work at such a young age. But this book was deplorable to read. The thing about Push is that Precious was repeated raped and molested by her father and mother respectively, and she was quite anti Semitic and homophobic in the messaging she grew up with. Despite this, you tolerate and even root for Precious as the story continues because she is working on bettering herself in every possible way. Additionally, Precious is seen as more of a victim of her situation — she contracts AIDS from her father at the height of the AIDS crisis, she has no father figure in her life so she looks up to renowned antiSemite and notorious homophobe Louis Farrakhan, excusing a few of her more racy views (that is, until she meets two butch lesbians who start to shift her attitudes), she mothers two children prior to 18 years old, and she’s on government assistance for almost the entirety of her life — and she has absolutely no control of how she is perceived, understood, or how she comes off. Along with all of the aforementioned issues, she is a fat darkskinned Black woman as well, as she’s fully aware of how her appearance doesn’t do her any favors when it comes to getting sympathy from others. Push ends on a neutral note, but it’s easily inferred that things look up for Precious, as by extent, Abdul.

The Kid follows Abdul’s life post-Precious, after she has died from AIDS at 27 years old. Abdul is now 9, and due to his father/grandfather having also died (in the previous book), he is to stay with Rita, one of Precious’ friends from alternative school. However, she doesn’t have the means to care for him, and he’s sent to live with a foster mother. Upon his arrival he is beaten and it is inferred that he is sexually assaulted by his older foster brother, and he wakes up in a hospital following his injuries.

This is where my sympathy for Abdul, or J.J., as he takes on, runs thin. J.J. is taken in to a catholic school house for boys where he is assaulted yet again by the adults of the church, and J.J., larger and older-looking than the other children, starts assaulting younger children as well as one of his peers, Jamie, during the nights. It’s a real horror fest to read Sapphire’s description of the rapes. In Push, at the very least, Precious feels ashamed for physically enjoying being raped (this detail, in itself, started to tell me that Sapphire might have experienced something similar to Precious as a child, and upon researching, I did learn that she was also frequently assaulted by her father). Abdul’s account of raping the children is so heavily romanticized, so normalized, and so merged with his maladaptive dreaming patterns that it’s beyond realism. It’s beyond brutal honesty. It’s disgusting, and nearly pornographic. I’ve given the book 2 stars because, as expected, Sapphire’s writing is like no other. Her imagery and grit really get to the pain involved with poverty as well as being Black in 1980s Harlem, but I can’t help but read this book and feel as if I’m seeing something I shouldn’t be seeing. Every survivor of assault and rape is different, of course, but if this was written for Sapphire to cope with her own past, perhaps she should have kept The Kid confined to her diary. Truly a revolting piece of work."
The Kid,Cyndi,"February 13, 2012",4.0,"A very thought-provoking and engaging book. But ultimately confusing and some what unsatisfying. This is a sequel to Push, Sapphire's 1996 novel which was made into the 2009 movie Precious. While you can read The Kid without having read Push, I'd do them in order. If you have not read Push, or seen Precious, this review will have spoilers.

Push ends as as the main character leaves her abusive life behind and creates a new life with her toddler son, Abdul. The Kid begins when Abdul is 9 and his mother has just died of AIDS. The rest is a story of a child ground up by the foster care system and how he tries to create a life for himself despite it.

It's as if Sapphire is telling two stories. I find it hard to believe that Precious would not have made plans for her son's care, since she had nearly a decade after being diagnosed with, what was then, a near universally fatal disease. Precious' grandmother states later that she was supposed to have taken Abdul, but we don't know if we can take her word for it since she also had no contact with Precious or her child since he was a baby. Precious has middle class friends savvy to the system. They speak at her funeral, yet none of them take the child in. And no one, not a soul, has any communication with him for years or attempts to follow his progress.

I don't know Sapphire's motivations but it reads like she wanted to write about ""throwaway"" foster children and she wanted to do a sequel to her one and only novel. It is unfortunate that she did both in the same character.

Putting that aside, the book does deal with the insanity of the system and how kids either break or cope (or both). We see how abuse creates abusers. And how few really care enough about the children to insist on change. We also learn about Precious' family, though in an odd way. We get levels of detail that seem completely inappropriate for the story (an elderly woman telling her teenaged relative what she likes sexually) but there are a lot of gaps (huge gaping holes).

Like his mother, Abdul fantasizes constantly, but his dreams are often true (especially when he pretends actions he knows are wrong are dreams). The last chunk of the book is an extended dream sequence where we don't know what is real or fantasy and we never find out. I don't mind a book ending with an uncertain future, as Push does. We know at the end of Push that Precious is not now going to have a normal, financially secure, life. But she is determined to make the most of the life she does have. With The Kid, we know so little about what was happening towards the end that we can't even guess what might happen once the book closes. And that is, unsatisfying."
The Kid,Lynecia,"April 28, 2012",2.0,"First off, the rating I really want to give this book is 2.5, but since Goodreads doesn't allow that, I'd say it has to be closer to 2 stars.

This novel was hard to read. Because of its stream-of-consciousness-style and because of the rough (at times PERVERTED) content. Abdul, the main character doesn't get any breaks in life. After his mother Precious finally succumbs to AIDS when he is 9 years old, he is put into foster care and every horror that kids in ""the system"" are known to endure, Abdul contends with. He is abused, broken, unloved and consequently becomes an abuser, and is himself unloving. His only desire in life is to become a dancer and he does so against all odds, but never quite overcomes the demons of the unfair life he didn't choose. In the end, it seems he just loses his mind. I guess the author wanted to make a point. For people like Precious, the protagonist of this novel's prequel - there really aren't any happy endings. Hope is a thin, short-lived sentiment, evaporating into thin air for those who have the cards stacked against them. This is what happens to children who are victims of the AIDS crisis, this is what happens to children in ""the system""...it leaves one feeling that there is no fairness in the world. I don't recommend this to you if you can't stomach a dose of despair."
The Kid,Laura,"August 18, 2019",1.0,"Long-belated review. . . I actually liked Push by Sapphire. Yeah, it's one of those books where a bunch of bad things happen and that's the whole plot, but I'm cool with that.
This book somehow manages to take it too far. I somewhat want to reread both books just to refresh my memory. Push kind of had a logic to it. . . I don't know if I'd say the bad things either character faced were ""worse,"" as that's ridiculous, but it's like Sapphire went out of her way to shock people with The Kid. On top of that, Jamal/Abdul (and I'm sure Sapphire had a literary reason for giving him multiple names, and it kind of makes sense, but OMG, it's just another ""too much"" element lacking in execution) is always having these dreams and fantasies and flashbacks and things, and it's hard to tell what's even going on, or if he himself has a firm grasp of what's going on. Probably part of the point, too, but it just didn't deliver for me.

Dammit, I really want to reread these books now. I can't! I have to read A Little Life first!!"
The Kid,Kelly,"July 29, 2011",2.0,"Just... totally unsatisfying. I loved Push and had wanted the best for Precious, but this book just took Precious's struggle and stomped it into nonexistance. Precious wanted to shield Abdul from the life she had endured, but at the end it was all for nothing. I had to slog through this book, force myself to finish because I don't like to give up on books. But this was just a wasted read. I couldn't make sense of Abdul's thoughts, tell fantasy from reality, or even bring myself to like him. This book was missing all the heart and likeability that Push had. Maybe you're not supposed to like Abdul, but I just couldn't sympathize with him at all like I could with Precious, and therefore I couldn't bring myself to care about what happened to him.

Sorry, Sapphire, but I don't see this one being made into a movie. Who wants to watch a movie about a monster who rapes little boys and beats people and feels good about it?"
The Kid,Kristen,"September 5, 2011",3.0,"This is a hard book to review. The sexual violence in this novel is so raw and disturbing that I'd have a hard time recommending it to anyone. Stylistically, the stream of consciousness narrative - especially when the protagonist is younger, 9 and 13 - reads annoyingly gratuitous for long stretches at a time. On the other hand, the book makes such an important point about the systematic and layered vulnerability to physical and psychological violence confronting kids, especially those of a racial minority, who enter the child welfare system that it's hard to dismiss. This is a similar theme to Push, but while that novel ended with a glimmer of hope that Precious' coming to critical consciousness would offer her some protection, The Kid reminds us that, oftentimes, will alone is not enough in the quest to survive. Perhaps, in the end, this is what makes this book so hard to read."
The Kid,Sherril,"March 29, 2012",5.0,"Unfortunate this book has such a low rating. I think that's probably more due to the difficulty of the subject matter than the actual worth of the book. Going by my volunteer work for CASA with abused and neglected kids in our court system, this book is unfortunately very possible. Maybe unlikely that all this stuff happened to one kid, but definitely realistic. A lot of the vernacular that was used in the first half of the book was hard for me to read, then a lot of it is kind of stream of consciousness style that I just went with; I've found that's just how I have to do that. Seemed entirely plausible that the mind of a kid who had gone through what Abdul had might actually have a similar thought process format. An excellent vision of what can and does happen to kids in the system - and out of it."
The Kid,Susan (aka Just My Op),"July 25, 2011",,"I made it only to about page 65 in this one, so no star rating from me because I don't have enough basis. Too much abuse, bad language, things that are too hard for me to read. I don't usually have a problem with bad language and can soldier on through the violent and rough parts of a book, even gravitate towards some horror, some very dark books, but this one hurt me to read. The author's book Push on which the movie Precious was based, was also an emotionally hard read, but I thought it was excellent. This one is just too much for me right now. And probably too much for me ever."
The Kid,Jdoody,"August 15, 2011",1.0,"This is the deal, I loved Push by Sapphire and was interested in reading The Kid by the same author. Of course, Push was difficult to read in places but I could ""stomach"" it becuase it was a beautiful story and well written. However, I had to quit reading the Kid at page 53. I cannot finish this book and would NOT recommend this to book to anyone. The violence in so horrific and so ghastly that my stomach actually did a flip and I felt ill. The sad part is that the horrendous and sick (nearly pornographic and not in a good way) scenes didn't seem timely not necessary for that early on in the story. I am sorry but feel compelled to speak up about this book."
The Kid,Cindy,"October 3, 2011",2.0,"Intense. Sapphire is a wonderful author and I loved PUSH when I read it back in high school.

However, I was let down by this book. The whole thing was a page turner until the last 130 pages and it started coming apart. By the last 70, I had no idea what was going on anymore. Once I got to the final page, I got pissed about the ending. It was abrupt and I felt cheated due to investing so much time and energy into enjoying the earlier part of the novel.

Boo. I hate hasty tie-up endings."
The Kid,Sue Lunt,"July 19, 2011",2.0,"I understand the point the author was trying to make, but between the stream of consciousness style that it is written in, which was hard to follow at times, and the near constant (violent) sexuality, it was hard for me to read. I'm not easily offended, I just felt that a lot of the content was simply for shock value."
The Kid,Jocelyn,"July 23, 2012",5.0,"Beautiful, ugly, brilliant. From a literary perspective, one of the best books I've read in a long time. I would recommend The Kid to readers that are unafraid of a challenge, and who want to explore a portrayal of human experience rooted not only in physical actions or the ""facts of what happened,"" but in the realms of consciousness that cannot be measured by common perceptions of ""reality."""
The Kid,Alpa,"October 10, 2011",5.0,"Hard to read, but worth it. A chance to feel first hand the life of an abandoned child whose only constant in life is a fast food place. Not a comfortable read, but it is very important that this story is told."
The Kid,Kassy Salmon,"October 9, 2012",1.0,"I kept hoping for more. Although I hated the writing style of the book, I put up with the rambling thinking that I would at least see Abdul find peace through dancing. The ending was a complete fail."
The Kid,Markell,"May 4, 2020",3.0,"This might be late but I’m writing this because I’ve seen so many people be confused on the ending of the book and I’ve recently just finished it and wanted to share my opinion on the ending and what exactly happen to him (this is my opinion I could be wrong but it’s just my theory)

Abdul was 19 when he went into the mental hospital but many are confused on the events that accrued on how he got there simply because the book is Abdul’s mind it’s to leave the reader just as confused as he is. Looking closely it wasn’t hard for me to come up with the this time line and it starts right at the restaurant when he keeps thinking that his birth certificate is a mistake. Indeed he discovers that his father is also his mother’s father and he’s a child of incest. This is shown because when the doctor as about his parents he tells him “he never had a father” (this could be taken in many ways but to make it have sense this seems more reasonable) which coming into realization really puts his mental state on edge.

When he speaks with the doctor about the old man that takes him to the hotel this was after he left Roman. He admits he started to sell hisself more even tho he has “friends” that was supporting him but didn’t want to rely on them all the time. This sparks his rage that he comes across men who are no different from the brothers. What seems like the first encounter of this is the old white man that brings him to the hotel. When the man tries to con him for a cheap price he loses it. But I feel like that wasnt what truly set him off. I feel as if it was more because he felt like the man would get away with it while he was left with little to nothing. Why I think this is because simply how things turned out with the brothers. After being kicked out we all seen how much he resented them for it. He was kicked out for something they were doing to him and got away with it while he lost what felt like a home to him and they remain free and continued to what and anything else they pleased. The old man was buying boys out for cheap (mostly boys who were struggling and had nothing or no one) While he became satisfied with full pockets and the boys felt after everything all they got was a cheap pay that wouldn’t last them a day. I suppose after so much thinking without it being said he realized it for what it was and lost it which caused him to beat so many other men that did similar things.

My lai was definitely his first love, he admits it was just for her body and money at first but he comes into knowledge that he really loves her when he feels betrayed. When she asked him to kill her parents he and her saw her situation differently which is what I think caused them to go separate ways. While MyLai hates her father for what he’s done she wants nothing but revenge. While Abdul sees she has the life he always wanted and couldn’t understand why she could t let what he’s done to her go. Because of the things he suffered he felt like everyone has or will be a victim of some type of form of sexual abuse, and because of this he felt like MyLai would have just been appreciative that she didn’t suffer through life like he did. MyLai felt differently simply because she became a person who held onto the pain she endured during the nights and couldn’t forgive him for what he’s done to her. He felt like she was only using him after her request. But they are very much in love with one another because of the pain they both endure they lean up on each for support. I feel as once he was released they would end up back together.

The after party is the event that leads him to the mental hospital. At the party he admits he notices a child, but had thought nothing of it. What turns off as something innocent leads to dark thoughts. While taking the child to the bathroom Abdul begins to image sexually assaulting the child. And even goes so far to even see how his friends would reach to it because he feels he would’ve been caught. What makes this known that this is just a thought in his head he says he has such a strong pain headache like he’s never experienced before and once he looks into the mirror he sees brother John. That moment he sees himself as one of them, after enduring such hardships he finally breaks and acknowledges that he’s what he’s hated the most all this time. That’s when he goes for the knife not wanting to harm the child or become like the brothers he attempts suicide.

The mistake identity was just wrong timing. Once the police arrive they requested him name which I’m sure he just said Abdul and they assumed he was the man on the records they were after. This is how they gotten him mixed up with the other man. But the doctor clears that up. This is also the real reason (for me) that the doctor wants him to talk. To acknowledge hisself for who he truly is. No longer living in and out of the Fantasy world that he was living in and out of to deal with the pain and suffering he endured throughout his life to get him by.

And finally the reason why the doctor will release him, after listening to Abdul he realizes not only is he not the guy on record but that Abdul comes into truth with hisself. One of the most important things of recovering from a mental break down is coming face to face with the truth. Even after admitting beating up the men who he referred to as the “cheap ones” he didn’t kill them. And listening to his thoughts about the child how he rather take his life then to allow hisself to do such a thing again to a innocent child he seen even in such a wrecked state of mind he was trying to be a better person. Which I assume he doesn’t feel Abdul was an honest threat. And with attempting to hurt hisself at the end he tells Abdul before that event happens that the man next door to him hung hisself because he did it to hisself so I feel like he was basically telling him even when life is hard you have choices but take responsibility for your own choices and no longer blame the past for what is happening in the present because he’s in control of that, this I feel is the reason he is being released.

This is my conclusion on the ending I hope it’ll help whoever is clueless to get some satisfaction off the story, the story has a very very very dark real life theme this is why many don’t like it, but the message is much bigger."
The Kid,Syddacia Sova,"June 27, 2020",1.0,"This was a painful read. The story trying to be told was intense, and not entirely unlike its predecessor “Push”. However, the narrative is completely discombobulated and it does not follow a real linear path. It is almost impossible to understand the narrator, with the exception of he constantly thinks about his genitalia.

The first novel was amazing, and I’d hoped the same for this one. However, I was incredibly let down. There is a beginning, a hazy middle, but the ending is completely confusing, and we as the reader are never given any clarity.

It’s unfortunate that this novel was nowhere near as powerful as the first."
Wild Animus,Mallory,"November 13, 2011",5.0,"(sarcasm alert- I don't actually think this book deserves five stars)

All you people who've been trashing Wild Animus, the fine and revealing work by Mr. Rick Shapero, have been looking at everything the wrong way. Just look at it positively, and you'll feel better about it.

For example, you could think about all the good things about it, like:

* It's shorter than ""Atlas Shrugged""!
* If a genetically-modified polar bear attacks you with a flamethrower, you can distract it by throwing the book at its face, then run away!
* Makes a useful gift for people you hate!
* Finally provides an ending for the sentence, ""Twilight is better than (fill-in-the-blank).""
* Perfect weight and balance for throwing at a roommate who won't fracking shut up and let you go to sleep!

Or, you could imagine that the tiny imperfections that mar this marvelous book don't exist. Imagine, for instance, that the protagonist isn't a completely selfish, moronic, insane idiot who does nothing useful at all, that the ""love"" ""interest"" isn't a horrifyingly passive victim, that the prose isn't so full of manure you could fertilize the entire state of Montana with it, or that this whole undertaking of reading ""Wild Animus"" isn't a complete waste of time that you could be spending on more valuable activities (i.e. castrating yourself with a handful of rusty nails, fighting a pack of rabid Dachshunds with nothing but a rubber chicken, jumping into a huge box of dirty syringes, swallowing a gallon of hydrochloric acid, electrocuting a Yuuzhan Vong with a car battery, running into an al-Qaeda hideout wearing nothing but a tuxspeedo and a shirt saying ""Kiss me, I'm a Navy SEAL"", etc.).

Just keep pretending this book isn't the worst thing ever, and it won't be!"

Wild Animus,Sally Wolf,"March 24, 2011",1.0,Please note that before you read any more of this review that it does contain a spoiler this is done for a very good reason to save you the effort of reading this book all together. This book is about a man who gets high on drugs then he dresses like a Mountain Goat from head to foot (yes I said Mountain Goat) and goes into the wilderness where he gets eaten by a pack of wolves. From what I can tell the author of this book was trying to portray the power of the wilderness but it was lost in the stupor of a dug induced banter that made no sense at all. Please do not read this book do not recommend it to friends and if you happen upon it walk away quickly so that you are not tempted to even pick it up. I got this book out of a free bin and now I know why it was there.
Wild Animus,Dorothy,"April 24, 2016",1.0,"I really thought this book was going to fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category. I mean, come on, the tagline is basically ""guy takes tons of drugs and thinks he's a sheep,"" it doesn't get better than that. I prepared myself for a twisted romp I could discuss with my friends and they would shake their heads, saying ""gosh, Dorothy, you read the strangest things.""

Instead I found the disheartening tale of a mentally unstable, drug addicted sociopath who abuses and manipulates a damaged young girl (btw we constantly focus on how young she is/seems, to a creepy pedophile level) into abandoning her life and working multiple shitty jobs to fund his unsafe, unreasonable, unhealthy adventures into the mountains. Just as the main character strives to look past the facade of society, I looked past the ""lol drug sheep"" veneer and into the deeper, more disturbing elements of this book. Only once or twice does anyone suggest that he has a mental health problem, and it is blown over. He is even in a hospital, ranting naked in the reception area, and they allow him to leave and go about his life. Everyone constantly enables him beyond the point of reason, and some become a cult-like 'following.' At one point a conversation goes like this:

Wife: Honey, maybe you should stop taking so much acid. I'm worried about you.
Husband: YOU ARE LITERALLY DESTROYING MY LIFE. YOU ARE LITERALLY A PACK OF WOLVES HUNTING ME TO DEATH AND WILL NOT STOP UNTIL YOU FEAST ON MY FLESH. FINE, HAVE IT YOUR WAY, DEVIL WOLF WOMAN. I AM DONE WITH THIS MADNESS. I WILL BE HUMAN AGAIN. I'M JUST GONNA GO OVER HERE AND BURN MY MANUSCRIPTS THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS, I'M READY TO QUIT THIS DRUG SHEEP LIFE. *starts setting manuscript on fire.*
Wife: Honey, wait. The drug sheep thing is important to you. Don't set that on fire. Here, have some more acid.
Husband: I LOVE YOU. YOU ARE MY EVERYTHING. LET'S HAVE SEX.
Wife: I will follow you to Alaska and do whatever you tell me. This is fine.

Also, it could have used a bit more editing for grammar and repetitive word choices."
Wild Animus,Tim,"November 4, 2007",1.0,"Was handed this book while walking through a Bay Area (SF CA) street fair. I think they were trying to drum up ""word of mouth"" business, but really, with a book this lame, I think they were misguided. Perhaps, if you're into drug-fueled hippie shamanistic naturalism, you'll enjoy the book. I did force myself to read the whole novel, but it was poorly written and painful to get through. The first clue it was going to be bad was that the prologue reveals the ending! That removed all tension or suspense. It was hard to care about his ""journey"" because I knew what was ultimately going to happen. Additionally, the protagonist is so misguided and enmeshed in his own reality, that I found nothing relatable (or even particularly believable). I don't want to say the character and the novel have no redeeming qualities, but they are so buried under bad prose and the character's complete idiocy, that they're hard to find and harder to care about."

Most of us still refer to it as ""that book"". Kind of like ""that woman"" regarding an obnoxious woman.

I saw a bunch of copies in the Friends of the Library saleroom. I take that as a sign we were not the only ones who found it icky."
Wild Animus,Catherine,"March 23, 2009",1.0,"The copy I read, being an advance reading copy, doesn't have this cover.

I sort of sought this book out, knowing a little of its Bookcrossing history, but not, at the time, just how bad many people thought it was. I'm sorry to say that I didn't think it was great either. I didn't think it was awful per se - I could see a certain fascination in the shamanistic blurring of identity - but it too coarse in its mysticism for my taste and with too little to counteract that.

I could not empathise at all with the complete submission to Animus/descent into self-destructive madness (take your choice of perspective) of Sam/Ransom, nor could I understand the role Lindy played in his revelation or her willingness to suppport him in so many ways for so long. And that is coming from someone with an uncanny ability to find and stick with partners who leave her broke (for those of you who know him, I feel duty bound to point out that Spike is one of the few who hasn't). Nonetheless Lindy did at least have enough of a backstory to make a little sense of her holding on when she had no hope of changing him, whereas we saw nothing of the 'raw' Sam to explain his developing monomania, unless one chooses to 'blame' the drugs - a far too facile (and inadequate) plot device. That so many of the community in which he found himself were, albeit eventually, impressed was also incredible: yes, a Messiah may be the most unexpected person, but Ransom's 'message' did not seem to be communicated to others, even Lindy, in any convincing or powerful way.

All in all, a shame - a compelling idea, with some wonderful descriptions of Alaska and real attempts to view things from the point of view of another creature (albeit with some slips), that is let down by characters that are totally subservient to the plot and style."
Wild Animus,Cade,"September 24, 2009",1.0,"Worst book ever. As many others have stated, it was also given to me. Got mine in Chicago outside the Art Institute. They had boxes of them. I didn't have anything else to read at the time. Honestly, I didn't finish it. I made it 1/2 way and just didn't care any more about acid trips, wolves, or goat costumes/hallucinations of wolves in goat costumes or whatever. I wanted to find the person that gave it to me and give it back. I actually went out and looked for them. They were gone.

I have kept books, sold books, donated books, lended books and just given books away. This is the first book I can think of that I threw in the trash.

Actually, the one interesting thing about this book is finding out where everyone else got their free copy. Who the hell paid to have these printed? There's got to be an interesting stoy there. Some publisher that knew they would lose even more if they tried to market it? Some ecentric rich old lady? A government fund?"
Wild Animus,Angela,"February 18, 2008",1.0,Free was too costly
Wild Animus,Ed Erwin,"June 28, 2020",1.0,"Not nearly as bad as I hoped. I hoped this would be monumentally bad -- so bad it's funny -- but it is just ordinarily mediocre.

It starts with this guy living in Berkeley who gets tired of city life and wants to escape to a more natural setting where he can commune with nature, take acid every day, dress in a goat costume, climb a volcano, join a goat family, and get chased by wolves. How could I not read that? Apart from some minor details -- wool makes me itchy -- that perfectly describes me! I got hooked on that idea and before I knew it I was halfway through. I actually read the whole thing, ... and I regret it.

After you learn the basic idea, there is nothing more to it. The prologue already tells you that he will die in a volcanic eruption while simultaneously being eaten by wolves, so there is really no suspense.

I got this book for free. That is typical. If you paid money for it, you are unusual. The author has given out 1000s and 1000s, perhaps hundreds of thousands of free copies of this book in nice hardback editions. is far more interesting than this book itself.

If you only read one book about a man turning himself into a goat, please don't make it this one. is much better, has pictures of the goat suit, and isn't even fiction."
Wild Animus,Jeruen,"December 22, 2017",1.0,"This perhaps is the most pathetic and corniest book that I have ever read. I thought this was the worst book I have ever encountered, and I pondered on whether it even deserves a review or not, but hey, if I didn't like it, I better review it to save other people from the 315 pages of corny pretentious prose that it contains.

This novel tells the tale of Sam, a Berkeley student who suddenly gets a fascination about rams. As the novel progresses, he and his girlfriend Lindy decide to leave Berkeley and move to Seattle and eventually Alaska, as he transforms himself into Ransom, a disciple of the god Animus, who resides in Mount Wrangell. Ransom goes on to climbing expeditions on to the mountain, which is obviously treacherous, but somehow he doesn't care. After all, he's a spiritual leader right? He writes chants and records them, while donning this full fur regalia, meant to transform him into a ram.

Needless to say, this novel was set in the days when bell-bottom pants were in fashion, and so was LSD. Yup, to those readers who are still in touch with reality, this is just a narrative about a couple of people who were somehow delusional, aided by their acid trips. Ransom was just a victim of his own delusion, thinking that he was this disciple of some god residing in the mountain.

Now, even if we suspend disbelief for a moment, which is really hard, this book still is not worth the paper it is written on. The characters are just so unrealistic. Really, Lindy, you're the most pathetic woman ever. Are you really fine with Ransom squandering all of your earnings from your two jobs as waitresses in order for him to climb up that stupid mountain? He's also able-bodied, right? Why doesn't he work? What do you see in Ransom that you keep slaving away for his delusional whims?

And Ransom, wake up. You're delusional, you're egotistic, and you're out of touch with reality. That was the biggest take-home message I got from this book, if ever I were to take home one. Ransom is one lunatic and I would strive really hard not to be like him. One cannot be just like a mad scientist and believe whatever he wants to believe. That's why there's peer review. Ransom believed that there's a god in the mountain and he just went with it. How naive and pathetic. I am glad that he died in the end.

There, I even gave the ending away, so that you won't have to go through what I went through. Do not read this book. It's a total waste of your time. Oh, did I forget to mention that this book was self-published and given to me free? I figured that shouldn't matter in the review, but somehow, given the quality of the prose, it is slowly becoming relevant.

I am giving this 0.5 out of 5 stars, only because it's the lowest value I can give. If you want to read about an acid trip, read Naked Lunch by William S. Burroughs instead."
Wild Animus,Erika,"June 9, 2010",1.0,"***Disclaimer***
If I were to recommend this book to a spiritual Shaman, I would give it 5 stars. However...

I found the book somewhat ridiculous. It showcased stereotypical male self-centerdness even in the midst of a sacrificial relationship. The story was a complete disappointment without any overarching philosophical take-aways."
Wild Animus,melydia,"November 14, 2008",1.0,"I want to say something nice about this book, but I'm having trouble. I will admit that heavy drug-usage and self-centered obsession with finding oneself are not things I can relate to, but that was the least of my complaints. The prose was overwrought with awkward metaphors and obscure adjectives, so bad that I could just see the author congratulating himself on his cleverness and originality. The dialogue was so forced that it made soap operas sound Oscar-worthy. The description was so flowery that it interfered with the story, making the narration clunky and hard to follow. The story itself took leaps and bounds through time, skipping over massive amounts of necessary exposition, transition, and even conversation - I lost count of the times two people would say meaningless sentences and then the text would say that they understood exactly what the other meant. That's fine, but I the reader was still completely lost, and after a while I stopped caring.

The characters evoked exactly no sympathy whatsoever: they're overemotional and completely irrational. The story revolves around Sam, a disillusioned Berkeley student in the late 1960s who has a strange obsession with rams and little concern for anything or anyone else but his own desires. His wife Lindy is a complete doormat, working a deadend job to fund her husband's drugs and solo trip to Alaska to research his book, incidentally called Wild Animus. The second she starts standing up for herself and asking, ever so timidly, that Sam (now called Ransom for some reason) make any effort in their relationship whatsoever, she breaks down crying and begs forgiveness for being such a bitch. She breaks down crying almost every scene she's in, come to think of it. Every character is constantly on the verge of an emotional collapse or breakthrough, which usually happens (the first time) very soon after the introduction of the character (then several times again after that). I wonder if everyone in the author's world is of weak emotional character except, of course, Ransom, who shows no emotions whatsoever.

It's a train wreck of poor writing. Even the bolded sections, which I guess were supposed to be spiritual chants, were of the literary quality of your average 15-year-old would-be poet. For a few chapters it was funny, then it became tedious, then annoying. I labored on, telling myself I wanted to finish it so I could write a thorough and fair review, but then I realized that the only reason I was still reading was because the prologue strongly implied that Ransom would die by the end of the book. I ultimately decided - about halfway through the book - that such drivel was not worth my time when the only thing I had to look forward to was the offing of the main character, which would doubtless be as poorly written, uninspired, and pointless as the rest of the story."
Wild Animus,Antof9,"January 5, 2009",1.0,"This is an Advance Reading Copy (ARC), received free as the result of a partnership between BookCrossing and the publisher of the book.

Read on the plane from Denver to Newark for a business trip. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the subject matter OR the way it was written.

This book was probably written sometime between the 60's and 70's (although not published till recently), as it happily discusses drug use and doesn't refer in any way to current conveniences such as mobile phones.

: an LSD-using student tries to ""find himself"" in a very odd way. Over the course of his life, in various ways, he has an odd connection with a ram, and over time turns into/worships the ram. Unfortunately, as a messiah figure, Ransom (formerly known as Sam) isn't very messianic, as there is no one to save, no downtrodden, no nothing. Although it does appear that a group of people might be interested in him enough to follow him, he's really just too wacked out to follow.

: I've always thought it kind of hackneyed when the main character in a book is an author, and ends up writing a book with the same name as the title of the one you're reading. It was cheesy with Judith McNaught; it's too hard to suspend belief for this one. It really bothered me that there is rock climbing while under the influence of LSD. Real mountain/rock climbers wouldn't do something so dangerous, and often speak of the natural high they get sans chemicals. The author loves to ""verb"" nouns (which bugs me), he uses ""alright"" a million times, and chooses ""regalia"" as the description for the animal skin that Ransom wears, every time it is described.

I didn't understand most of what the author was trying to accomplish. At one point, it seems as if he is saying something, but then it wanders away. . .

""Do you mean people shouldn't have children?"" Hank wondered.
""That's when we gave up,"" Calvin acceded with a sigh. ""Stopped chasing our dreams and started nurturing theirs.""
""I get what you're saying."" Wasilla Bill spoke to Ransom with his head bowed. ""My heart's cold as stone. Only whiskey warms me. When I'm drunk, I remember.""
""This is sad."" Doug's gaze darted among them, anxious and uncertain. His comment seemed to include both their malaise and Ransom's unthinkable remedy. ""I can't believe having children is the end.""

There are passages like this all throughout the book. In other parts, it reads like a write-by-number novel: ""You're everything to me now."" Sam's voice was meek as a child's. ""I want our love to be my religion."""

My thoughts in the first 3rd of the book: ""LSD meets Extreme Sports"" , ""Farley Mowatt on Acid and Gone Mad"", and ""I Am Ram, See Me Leap!"". In the second 3rd of the book I became very concerned for and creeped out by Lindy. In some way she seemed more the core of this book than Ransom (Sam) and the wolf-gang connection had me feeling spooked. In the last 3rd of the book I was really wondering if I knew what was going on at all and I spent as much time wondering about the author as I did his odd characters, including Animus. I think it is about the search for G-d, both within ourselves and without. It seems crazy in the book; but in our world most people are involved in this search and we don't call it crazy even though so many people have died through it. Yet how can we live without G-d? That connection seems essential. The book is spooky, weird, sad and very different from most books. (Today: I think that my assessment in the first third of the book was probably correct. The book is the result of LSD and maybe some high altitude oxygen deprivation.)"
Wild Animus,Manday,"July 10, 2009",1.0,"I understand why this is the worst rated book on Good Reads (that is also why I read it, but that is a different story).

What starts out as indulgent hippie drivel turns into ridiculous nonsense. The main characters are an acid-dropping mentally ill man who is convinced he is becoming a ram and a submissive pathetic enabling girlfriend who blindly follows him, sex being to be the only thing that holds their relationship together in any way shape or form.

I seriously don't even know why this book exists."
Wild Animus,Peter Derk,"March 6, 2015",,"I barely read it. I mean, it doesn't seem like it's for me. Way too mystical.

I DID write a pretty long column about just what the hell this book is and why it shows up EVERYWHERE.

Wild Animus,Angela,"April 1, 2017",1.0,"I tried. I really tried. But I gave up on Wild Animus at page 189.

The story starts out with some promise, and even has one or two well-constructed sentences here and there, which leads me to believe that author Rich Shapero may learn to write someday. But the multitude of awfulness by far outweighed the few good bits. Execrable writing for the most part plus the gaping holes in the plot pushed the generous leeway I allow a first-time author past its outermost limit.

Ultimately I did not like Ransom and his drug-induced hallucinations, and I did not believe in his vision.

Plot problems: Where did these two broke college students get the money to leave Berkeley on a whim and move to Seattle? And how did they afford airfare to Alaska if Lindy was the sole bread winner? She waited tables! And let's not even get started on the character of Lindy -- wait, on second thought, yes, let's. Wimpish, cringing, insecure, verbally abusive, totally dependent on Ransom for validation of her existence and absurdly tolerant of his psychosis. Her character didn't ring true for a female UC Berkeley college student in 1968. Where was that woman's backbone? Her sense of self? And Ransom is plainly a candidate for a mental ward somewhere. One too many tabs of acid, my friend.

The reaction of the people in Alaska during and after Ransom's first trip to the volcano did not make sense. He was up there prancing around nekkid in a ""Ram Suit"" and they didn't call the nearest sanitarium? They wrote him letters of admiration? It was at this point I called it quits.

I appreciate Too Far Publications and BookCrossing for giving me the opportunity to read this. I only wish the book had been worth all the effort at promoting it."
Wild Animus,Lark KerBerethrou,"July 9, 2013",4.0,"I had never heard of this book when I picked it up, but as one who's always been intrigued by hippie culture, it seemed interesting. After reading he other reviews here on Goodreads I'm actually quite shocked that more people didn't like it. I barely noticed the drug use in this book, because to me that was not the author's intent. To me, this book was about finding yourself and exploring whatever strange routes that journey may lead you upon. Yes, there happened to be some drugs. But overall the feel I got from this book was not some drug-addled hippie nonsense as most of you seem to feel, but more of a getting-back-to-your-roots therian vibe. As someone who's very open minded and shamanistic myself, the things the character did in this book did not seem weird at all to me, but quite natural.

My only problem with this book was the dialogue. It seemed very unrealistic and deep-- and by that I mean, people in real life just don't say certain things to each other, especially not men to other men saying deep poetic things. It would have been fine if the author had added those things as an afterthought, a character thinking quietly to himself or something, but definitely not dialogue.

I give this book 4 out of 5 stars for creativity, original characters (HE DRESSES UP LIKE A RAM, you can't say that's not original), the overall theme which I found to be inspiring, and the fact that it is one of very few books with a therian character. It does lose a point for the cheesy dialogue though."
Wild Animus,M.M. Strawberry Library & Reviews,"August 21, 2019",1.0,"Drugs are bad, mmkay.

This book is an incomprehensible mess. Some people might be able to produce nice art when they're high, but this author is NOT one of them. This stuff might have made sense to him when he was high and being a furry, but there's really nothing funny about this book, and honestly comes across as more sad and desperate than anything else. It seems like this guy needs therapy more than anything else, and I say that in a honest and kind way."
Wild Animus,JD Newick,"June 14, 2013",1.0,"(I originally wrote this in 2010)

It is my belief that the last decade, (2000-2010), will be looked at as a golden age of unsolicited attention-seeking. Reality TV was the watchword, and the internet finally came of age- with Big Brother, Pop Idol, Youtube, Myspace, Livejournal, Facebook, and the “blogosphere“, any untalented loser could put their lack of abilities to use and, in many remarkable cases, see their narcissism paid off with 15 minutes of fame- luckily with the ghost of Andy Warhol always keeping a close eye on the clock. This was the decade when ordinary members of the public finally found cheap and easy means of getting their voice heard, and their voice was a unanimous “LOOK AT MEEEEEEEE!”

Rich Shapero was luckier than most, in that he had the financial means to get his work directly into the public eye, bypassing the factor of sheer luck that Gareth Gates, Nasty Nick, and Chris Crocker needed to become well-known (anyone remember any of those guys? No? Not surprised). Already a Silicon Valley “venture capitalist” by the time he set to work on Wild Animus, he was evidently a very wealthy man. Wealthy enough, it seems, to not only self-publish hundreds of thousands of copies of his book; not only hire musicians, producers, engineers, and studio time to record three CDs worth of music to accompany the book; not only package the book and the CDs in very luxurious packaging; not only hire street performers to dance around in animal outfits as a publicity stunt; but to then distribute every single copy of the book across the world, and give it away for free.

Yes, Rich Shapero has spent six years giving his book away to unsuspecting people. I was lucky enough to be handed a completely free copy just before Halloween 2010, at the Student Union of Reading University in the UK.

It was still a bloody rip-off.

Nonetheless, being as I am staggered by the time, money, and effort that Mr. Shapero has put into pushing his book into the public eye, I feel it’s only fair to satisfy his cravings, even if only in my own particular and humble way. I’m not trying to feed his narcissism; only trying to understand him as a remarkable case study of it. This is a review of the book and the music, but I do hope I’ve made clear just what a shameless cry for fame and acclaim the entire endeavour has been. The circumstances surrounding the project are, in itself, hugely related to the artistic merits of it- as if the book, the music, and the obsessive self-promotion are all exactly the same to Rich Shapero.

Our author has apparently been in the world of high-tech business for decades, making it all the more surprising that he chose the printed word rather than more “information age” methods to disseminate his novel. He also studied English Literature at the University of California in the late 1960s- just like the book’s protagonist Sam “Ransom“ Altman. Students, California, late 1960s… hippies. Oh yes. This clusterfuck of a book, filled with Furry overtones, misogyny, LSD, gross sex scenes, self-harm, pseudo-Shamanic and Blake-bastardising spiritualism, casual racism and homophobia, and half-baked purple prose, is A Tale Of Two Hippies; and I definitely had the very Worst Of Times reading it.

The story starts in California, where Sam takes an awful lot of acid with his new girlfriend Lindy and decides, on the basis of a photo of a ram on a magazine, to drop out of university and move to Alaska. His aim is to be able to spend time in the Alaskan wilderness to try to capture something of the wild, free, and wise spirit of the ram. He forces Lindy to drop out and move with him, and she takes on two jobs to fund his trips, while he dresses up in the skin and horns of a ram and frolics naked on the mountains for weeks on end, with the assistance of LSD obviously.

Things take a downward turn. Although Sam (who insists on being called “Ransom”) is clearly spiralling into drug-induced madness and becoming a parasitic bully towards his girlfriend, the author gives us no hint that his behaviour is intended to be interpreted as anything other than his Romantic and spiritual method of divining some profound truth about love, life, death, and the supernatural. He gradually becomes more obsessed with “becoming” an actual ram- at one point he is found wandering around town naked, tripping, and singing. After being bitten by a wolf, he starts reopening his wound every time it heals, so that he can bleed on the mountain in an attempt to get closer to the God “Animus” that he believes is part of the mountain.

I will repeat that bit, in case you thought you misread it. The main character is arrested while wandering around on LSD, stark bollock naked, singing Shamanistic “chants” about being a sheep. He cuts himself, in order to press the wound against the snow of a mountain, to get in touch with the local God that he invented. At the climax, he tries to take Lindy to the mountain top, from what I gathered with the aim of jumping into the volcanic crater at the top together.

None of the other characters think this to be the slightest bit strange. They think it’s eccentric at worst, admirable and inspiring at best, indulging him 100% as he slips deeper into acid-induced lunacy. Not that any of the other characters have any kind of personality or independent thought of their own: they are cardboard cut outs, existing only to assist or praise Sam/Ransom in his descent into madness. At no point whatsoever does anyone ever try to suggest that he be locked up in a mental asylum. What’s worse is that the author himself never portrays Ransom’s behaviour as insane, or as dangerous to himself and other. The author, like Ransom, believes that he is taking the right steps in his voyage of self-discovery; that his actions show nothing but the heroic passion and determination of a powerful Romantic soul. Incidentally, can you say “author self-insertion”? Ransom seems to represent the author’s own bizarre worldview.

I deliberately capitalised the word “Romantic”. The Romantic movement, lasting roughly from the 1770s to 1840s, was a reaction against the emphasis on science and reason which the Enlightenment had established. Beethoven, Wordsworth, Chateaubriand, Byron, Keats, Delacroix, Chopin, et al. encouraged a new outlook on the world. Art which examined the human soul, emotions, and the beauty of nature, would be more important in forming a better world than the cold logic and ideals that had created the disillusionment of the French Revolution and the grim poverty of industrialisation.

William Blake (1757-1827) in particular, encouraged not just looking at nature, but beyond nature, beyond what we can see with our five senses, and into what we can reveal to ourselves by means of imagination, visions, “poetic genius”, divine inspiration. Blake also believed in absolute freedom for all, not just political, but spiritual, emotional, and even sexual (though for him, sex should still be a matter of shared love rather than physical gratification). I dwell on the Romantics, and specifically Blake, because it is clearly their legacy that Shapero is attempting to channel. Blake is mentioned by name as Ransom’s favourite author, quotes from The Marriage Of Heaven And Hell pop up a few times, and much of Ransom’s garbled conclusions about love and life are based around Blake’s own (which are, of course, notoriously difficult for the newcomer to unravel and make sense of).

The difference is however, that while Blake was accused of being mad by contemporaries, he still led a normal life. He worked hard at his day job as an illustrator and printer, and was a very loving husband who treated his wife as his equal business partner as well as his soul mate. Ransom on the other hand is an obsessive sociopath; his girlfriend, a pathetic and sexist caricature of subjugated femininity, is forced to fund his mad schemes by working double shifts as a waitress; when she dares to try to bring him back to reality, he responds with verbal abuse and reduces her to tears. He has no redeeming features, she is an object of pity, and yet the author apparently expects us to see them as star-crossed kindred spirits with a higher purpose.

The way he demonstrates this is through sex scenes. Sex scenes are never pleasant to read. The only good example I can think of is from Douglas Adams’ “So Long And Thanks For All The Fish”- I can excuse this because a) Douglas Adams was a terrific author and b) the scene is more about the fact that the couple in question were flying as they were making love, rather than about the love making itself. Yet there are numerous sex moments between Ransom and Lindy. The worst is when they’re doing it in a field of sheep, and Ransom insists that they do it “like them”. So, on her hands and knees she goes, as he “mounts” her. One man’s yiff is another man’s emetic.

I mentioned the book’s casual racism and homophobia above. Yes, I know it’s set in the 60s, but that doesn’t excuse it. “I think Yasuda’s a queer” says Ransom at one point (I can’t remember who Yasuda is or anything about him). Well fuck you, Shapero! Call us “queers“ if you want, but at least I‘m not a creepy furry! As for the racism, I’m hoping it was a misguided attempt at political correctness-turned-tokenism. One chapter, and one chapter only, features “Ted Gloster, a tall black man”. That’s actually how he’s introduced. He doesn’t say or do much, but luckily he offers this moment which bowled me over:

Gloster pouted his swollen lips. “Shine, mistah?”

The Civil Rights Movement was still in full swing when the book was set, and this poor bloke has have nothing more interesting or useful to do than make an offensive joke about his own race.

Yes, the book is unbelievably pretentious, repulsive and unsettling, not only in its themes, storyline, and characters, but in Shapero’s writing style. A veritable purple rain of prose showers upon the reader. Unnecessary adjectives and adverbs abound. Barely a word is used that could not have been replaced with a less obscure one- Shapero’s thesaurus must have been dog-eared to buggery by the time he’d finished writing the book. The worst parts are the parts in bold and italic font- the passages which make up Ransom’s story and “chants” (the story follows Ransom, dressing and acting as a sheep, being chased by a pack of wolves, if you were wondering). The chants are in the form of odd little poems, and everyone around Ransom hears them spoken with awe and reverence. Example:

Gleaming spans life with thunderous grinds,

Crashing together. I rear on my hinds.

Around me you’ve bent

The blue ribs of a breathing tent.

In poetic terms, that’s in an AABB rhyming scheme. But look at the meter, imagine the words being spoken aloud. The meter is 9, 10, 5, 8. It doesn’t flow, it just sounds jarring and amateurish, especuially when recited as a “chant“. I can forgive good poets going a bit off with the meter occasionally, as it can make the poem more interesting- I recall Milton cutting a line short in Paradise Lost for dramatic effect, and the free verse of Blake and Ginsburg are brilliant. But every single “chant” is off-meter, nonsensical, and sounds like it was written by someone with no idea how good poetry works or sounds. And yet Shapero has an English Lit degree- granted, 35 years of the world of business lay between that and the writing of this book.

Yet the real corker is the prose parts forming Ransom’s story, which is also in bold and italic. Dull to read, not a single noun or verb without a redundant or meaningless adjective or adverb, and worst of all: a limited and repetitive stock of metaphors and even words. “Jolt”, “jerk“, “quake“, “cringe“, “blue”, “powder“, “hoarse pants”, “sulphur eyes”, are often used within the same page or even paragraph whenever we start reading Ransom’s thoughts. Yet these are supposed to be passages of intense action, of tension and excitement- Ransom is running away from a fierce pack of wolves. Overuse of extravagant language is an absolutely terrible way to build up drama- it does the opposite. It bogs the reader down. Flowery passages, when well-written, have their uses as descriptive moments, but they NEVER make a passage more exciting. Why on earth then, did Shapero save his most elaborate word choices for the parts of the book that are supposed to be the most thrilling?

I think I’ve summed up what’s wrong with the book pretty well. I’m scanning my brain for any redeeming features, but not finding any. Badly conceived, badly written, and badly edited nonsense, from a clearly very vain man with more money than sense or talent. But what of the music? Three discs worth of music in fact, each song accompanying a scene from the book itself.

The lyrics, to begin with, are taken from Ransom’s chants and story (I could never tell if the prose parts were from Ransom’s manuscript or his hallucinations, but who cares?). So they’re terrible. The music itself? The session musicians, whom Shapero hired by the dozed, are capable, and it’s well produced stuff. The genre is fairly folk-y, with vocals and acoustic guitar from Rich Shapero himself. Nick Drake sprang to mind while listening to it, though only in terms of its broad style. The music is in fact very dull. Every song sounds the same, and they seem to run into each other. I’m fine with songs that don’t fit a fixed verse/chorus structure (I’m a Zappa fan and a huge metalhead, for fuck’s sake), but these songs seem to lack any memorable melodies, chord progressions, hooks, or anything. They just drone tediously, going nowhere, never drawing the listener’s attention. Rich Shapero is not too bad at simply strumming the chords, but he can’t write an interesting song at all. Almost as bad is his voice- off-key mumbling occasionally trying to put on a more gruff “rocky” sound and failing. I mentioned Nick Drake (who I actually love)… I’ll clarify that comment, and say that the music sounds like Nick Drake if he had lived to become a useless, creepy, egocentric weirdo.

What good can be said about this train wreck of a “storytelling experiment“? It’s taught me a lot about how NOT to write and promote a book- if and when I finally get around to writing a novel, I’ll always have the mistakes of this book to learn from. It’s inspired me to re-read William Blake in the near future, if only to assure me that this kind of crap isn’t what the great poet had in mind. It’s pleasant proof that money can’t buy everything- certainly not popularity or critical acclaim as an author or musician (check the Amazon.com reviews as proof of this). Hmmm. I suppose at the end of the day, reading a book we hate makes us realise what draws us to the books we love- just like with films or music.

Above all though, it’s a fascinating warning in narcissism. Shapero has been desperately foisting this book upon the world for around six years now, to no avail but doubtlessly to great personal expense. His apparent obsession with becoming a respected author is a stark lesson that success in one field (say, business and investment) doesn’t make success in another field (say, literature and music) a foregone conclusion. Control your ego. Don’t assume you can become an artist by means of brute financial power.

Don’t write a book as shitty as “Wild Animus”, and for God’s sake don’t even bother reading one."
Wild Animus,Susan,"November 11, 2008",1.0,"It had so much potential with topics like disillusionment, relationships, nature, emotions, running away from it all, a gorgeous setting in the Alaskan wilderness. And then it just went way beyond odd when the main character evolved into a wolf.

This was no tale of the macabre, instead what it was likely supposed to be was a story full of hidden meaning and messages. Unfortunately it became instead simply a novel that was lost when the writer hurled us over the edge.

Disappointment was my overall feeling when, after reading half and skimming more, I finally set the book aside unfinished.

Imagination is one thing but hitting the reader over the head with it is another. I'd love to read something by the same author if he decided subtle is better than outlandish."
Wild Animus,K,"June 10, 2022",2.0,"I wanted to enjoy this book and everything it promised. I still do. An escape to Alaska. A bond with the primal. Man versus nature becoming nature. Selfless, devoted love in an unforgiving place. A hero's journey on the mountain. The academic attempt to quantify the beauty and mystery of the wilderness. Vision behind the veil. An escape from the pitfalls of modern society. Peace, quiet, and revelation at the end of the path.

I trudged through the angst-filled undergraduate rambling of the first few chapters that built a foundation of egoism and self-centred self-pity for the cast to stand on. I camped on the peaks of a love built on self-interest, bonding two lovers by the mere thread of dragging each other as far as possible before the other breaks. I swam through the rivers of multi-page shamanic ramblings that flowed from a gushing, roaming source - restricted to ontological questions posed, but rarely tackled.

The wounds carried by the main characters of this novel are introduced briefly as a fabric to cover their drug-assisted infatuation with each other. Nearly every major plot related discovery made by them is done under the influence, with the supposed lessons never being integrated into anything beyond the next self-destructive finale. Their escape brings them closer only by virtue of isolation. This book, much like the journey undertaken by the main characters, was fraught with cliffs and ridges of half-revelations which served only to inflate the final destruction of all parties involved. The imagery is vivid and fanciful, but serves little purpose beyond wooing the reader into overlooking the lack of depth to the flora and fauna of this narrative mountain. Shapero masterfully absolves himself and the plot from the responsibility of posing any concrete theses.

Initially, Shapero appears to have a suburban appreciation and understanding of the wilderness, which seems to grow ever so slowly as the story progresses. After learning that this book was written in tandem with Shapero's journey through Alaska following his exodus from California, the caged zeal breaking through the page becomes forgivable. Shapero writes with a grand respect and appreciation for the animals and nature encountered in this book, and doesn't shy away from bold, graphic sequences of ethereal visions.

The most redeeming aspects of this book beyond the spine are the accompanying music written by Shapero for the novel, and the Art Brut paintings done by François Burland - both in parallel with the poetry sewed throughout the book. These 39 acoustic songs brought me closer than the book to the essence I believe Shapero tried to capture, and Burland's art emits a primal haze chanted onto canvas that pairs wonderfully with it. Unfortunately, this is a review for the book.

I forced myself to finish this story, but I will not force myself to enjoy it in hindsight. While this arduous and revelatory journey may have been Shapero's, it was not mine. Ultimately, the view from the top of this mountain was limited by the disingenuous path that led to the peak.

Perhaps that introspection was the purpose of this book."
Wild Animus,Kendra,"August 10, 2019",1.0,"There are some great books out there and there are books you have to hold your nose to read. This book tells the ending in the prologue and I just couldnt wait to get there (the end, that is). When I finally did, the book just stopped...no closure of any kind (you know, because they told how it ended in the first page). The prose was horrible and I cannot fathom how a book with so many adjectives could be so utterly boring. The main character is entirely one dimensional and completely useless while his love interest is hideously needy and makes any self respecting woman over the age of 12 insulted with her lack of initiative. She sent feminism back 50 years (and it's set in 1968). My head hurts from all the cringing my face did during the reading. I asked myself how on earth this book got published and when I looked up the publishing company on a hunch, guess what I found? The author owns the publishing company. I figured that's the only way it could have been printed. The reviews of this book have more literary worth!"
Wild Animus,OskariJ,"August 21, 2017",1.0,"I picked up this book from a University Book Exchange shelf solely because I thought the name and the cover of the book were cool. I also was intrigued by the shamanistic-mystic journey of self-discovery that the back cover of the book promised.

In the end that promise fell several steps short. While the basic idea, attempting to get closer to nature and your ""true self"" via drug-induced trance isn't a bad plot, its execution didn't work for me at all. The parts where Sam/Ransom was ""transformed"" were steeped with fancy words and inexplicable incidents that both felt awkward and out of their depth. Profoundness turned to obscurantism and slight cringe.

The characters didn't appeal to me at all. Sam/Ransom himself seemed, in the end, to be just a druggie with a possible mental health issue and a deathwish. His obsession with his self-discovery seemed more and more to take a form of dangerous delusions than genuine advance towards the inner self. This might have been a deliberate motive of the author, but I felt that the original intent of the writer felt more genuine than what the actual end-result was.
The protagonist's relationship with his girlfriend was more abusive than committing. Again I feel that their relationship was supposed to be difficult and sacrificing, but it only came out as Sam abusing Lindy, dragging her more and more into his delusion and strange cult than keep her as a companion on their journey.

The ending was actually somewhat brave, the author was not afraid to deny his protagonist their prize. It was a bit confusing though, because a part of the ending was put right at the start, so at the same time the ending is spoiled, but you are also required to go back and read it again at the beginning, in case you forgot it.

I'm not against portrayal of unhealthy issues and phenomena in books. If the book would have been about a mentally ill person dragging his loved ones into a dangerous cult, it might have been an interesting read. Now, however, the author has seemed to intend wildly different conclusions that I were able to take from the book, so the result only seems hamfisted, questionable and bad."
Wild Animus,Myridian,"March 22, 2008",1.0,"This book was self indulgent dribble. It was just interesting enough for me to actually finish, but I really disliked most of the characters, and felt no sympathy for their story or their struggles. In essence I thought they were all tragically stupid, and it's people like this that waste most of the resources of the world. Essentially the story is about a young man who is convinced that he's tapped into God (through acid, of course), and he does get a number of people (including a dependent personality disorder girlfriend) to buy into his acid trip, but ends up committing suicide in the process. And the amazing thing is that this whole story is presented as if it has some heroic value. The author's picture is on the back of the book and he looks like a fairly reasonable guy. I kept expecting him to apologize for the absurd stupidity of his story, but apparently he thought there was value in it. I can't see why."
Wild Animus,Jason Whittington,"November 15, 2010",1.0,"The main character is often taking drugs to induce visions. Throughout the book, I felt the author was also heavily involved with drugs during the conceptualization and writing. I did not become attached to any characters. I never comprehended any sort of overall message, lesson, or value to the story. I only finished reading it because I couldn't believe the book could be as bad as it was, and I convinced myself there must be some twist before the end of the story that would make it all better, but it never happened."
Wild Animus,Judy,"January 20, 2010",1.0,"OMG, this was truly awful! I can't say anything good about the actual story -- it consists of one long acid trip that ends, naturally, in disaster. But since Shapero uses the prologue of his novel to divulge the ending, the remaining 300 pages are totally not worth the trouble. Don't waste your time. The one redeeming aspect of the audio version is that Peter Coyote is doing the reading. I only got to page 85."
Wild Animus,Johnny Worthen,"June 4, 2016",5.0,"I read this book many years ago, so many that I don't dare even guess when it was. I'm writing a review now, because even though it's probably been decades since I finished it, I still think about this book frequently. It confused me when I first read it, but it stayed with me like few other books in my life have. An extraordinary and compelling idea, magnificently realized and presented. Mature and insane. I think about it whenever I see lonely mountains and wonder why."
Wild Animus,Laura,"October 14, 2010",1.0,I couldn't stand this book. The descriptions of the scenes were way too detailed and the main character's thoughts and writings were tedious and not interesting. I couldn't relate to the what he was saying. I found the entire book tedious and painful to read and ended up skimming to actually finish it.
Wild Animus,Jim,"April 30, 2018",,"This is book is apparently freely handed out all over & is really awful. It's so pervasive & bad that it even has an article devoted to it here:

Wild Animus,Christie Bradley,"August 24, 2021",1.0,"This book is all over the place, it's extremely bizarre and not in a good way. The whole premise is that the main character is cracked out of his mind and flees to the mountains, does many drugs, and believes he is a mountain goat. I feel sorry for anyone whose unfortunate hands also found this book in them."
Wild Animus,bup,"December 5, 2007",1.0,"The poorly told story of a self-absorbed, girlfriend-dragging-down-with-him narcissist, and the people that fall in love with him."
Wild Animus,Matteo,"May 11, 2018",1.0,This book lived up to its title. It made me wild with rage and filled me with animus toward the author.
Wild Animus,Artemis Tau,"March 12, 2023",4.0,"This book really surprised me! It was recommended to me by my spouse, so I indulged him. At first, I really didn't like it, AT ALL. But that changed the more I read on! It's about a young, male adult's journey to find peace within himself, while tripping like hell on drugs.

I didn't like Shapero's writing either until I realized the purpose of the main character's internal dialogue between what was happening in reality. His thoughts and chants didn't make much sense to me at first but it develops meaning and beauty in the end.

In many places I kept asking myself ""Why is he doing or acting like this?"" and at times I would get frustrated. But it's worth it to finish the book. At least that's my opinion. Do you like weird, somewhat awkward people? Do you like the unexpected and surprises? If yes, then read this book."
Wild Animus,Sharon,"January 8, 2020",,"DNF - page 54 (17%)

Aw man... It wasn't as bad as I was hoping for. For the urban legend this book and its author have become, I was kind of hoping for The Room levels of bad... But it's just not good. Like, really not good, but I guess I wouldn't say it was mythical levels of awful.
Maybe I just have a lower tolerance for bad cinema than books, though.

Regardless, the legend this book has become... It's nuts, but I love the concept of never buying a book like this, just it. It wasn't handed to me by a stranger, but my best friend, after someone handed HER a copy on her college campus. While I'm not brave enough to foist it purposefully onto some unsuspecting soul, I will be leaving it in the give a book/take a book cart in the staff kitchen at my work.
Even if I didn't care about reading more than 50 pages, I certainly won't let the legend die!

Update 2020/01/07: The book is still there, sitting on the cart in the kitchen! No one has fallen into the trap yet."
The Eye of Argon,☘Misericordia☘ ⚡ϟ⚡⛈⚡☁ ❇️❤❣,"March 13, 2021",5.0,"That story went over like... like... like a story that doesn't go over very well. And it's contagiously hilarious! It bit me, for crissake! Someone, put me out of my misery, quick! NB! I started reading it knowing just what it is and it didn't disappoint. If anything, it overdelivered and overdelivered and went on ovedelivering on so many levels, I can't even count them all... It's so bad it can and should be used for laugh therapy sessions for geeks (just like yours truly).

Ultra, ULTRA, U L T R A freaking awesomely weird! Basically, this is a legend of a horrible novel. A masterpiece of botched literature. A veritable Hurrigane of Euphemisms, if one ever existed, I shit you not!

Why 5 stars? I don't think this wasn't written on purpose. And if it wasn't - the author is a genius nevertheless. THAT takes some balls and brains and paper and a really wild thesaurus. LONG THEIS!
So, rating composition:
+ 100 stars for the satire and cheek!
- 100 stars for everything that went wrong with this book (which is pretty much everything unimaginable and unnameable! I'm not even starting the list, it has no chance to fit in here!)
+5 stars for making me laugh and being the absolute winner in any and every category of the Books of the Nightmare!

Q:
Above his head rose the hideous idol, its empty socket holding the shaman's infuriated gaze.
His eyes turned to a stoney glaze with the realization of the pillage and blasphemy. Due to his high succeptibility following the siezure, the priest was transformed into a raving maniac bent soley upon reaking vengeance. With lips curled and quivering, a crust of foam dripping from them, the acolyte drew a long, wicked looking jewel hilted scimitar from his silver girdle and fled through the aperature in the ceiling uttering a faintly perceptible ceremonial jibberish.

Q:
They slew the guard placed over me and abducted me to the chamber in which you chanced to come upon the sacrifice. Their hell-spawned cult demands a sacrifice once every three moons upon its full journey through the heavens. (c)
Q:
The prince would surely have submitted them to the most ghastly of tortures if he had ever discovered their unfaithfulness to Sargon, his bastard diety. (c)
Q:
""Mrifk! I thought I had killed the last of those dogs;"" muttered Grignr in a half apathetic state.
Q:
""Nay Grignr. You doubtless grew careless while giving vent to your lusts. But let us not tarry any long lest we over tax the fates. The paths leading to freedom will soon be barred.
The wretch's crys must certainly have attracted unwanted attention,"" the wench mused.
""By what direction shall we pursue our flight?""
""Up that stair and down the corridor a short distance is the concealed enterance to a tunnel seldom used by others than the prince, and known to few others save the palace's royalty. It is used mainly by the prince when he wishes to take leave of the palace in secret. It is not always in the Prince's best interests to leave his chateau in public view. Even while under heavy guard he is often assaulted by hurtling stones and rotting fruits. The commoners have little love for him."" lectured the nerelady!
""It is amazing that they would ever have left a pig like him become their ruler. I should imagine that his people would rise up and crucify him like the dog he is.""
""Alas, Grignr, it is not as simple as all that. His soldiers are well paid by him. (c)
Q:
After spilling a spout of blood from the leader of the mercenaries as he dismembered one of the officer's arms, he retreated to his mount to make his way towards Gorzom, rumoured to contain hoards of plunder, and many young wenches for any man who has the backbone to wrest them away. (c)
Q:
""Thou hast need to occupy your time, barbarian"",questioned the female? ...
The engrossed titan ignored the queries of the inquisitive female, pulling her towards him and crushing her sagging nipples to his yearning chest. Without struggle she gave in, winding her soft arms around the harshly bronzedhide of Grignr corded shoulder blades, as his calloused hands caressed her firm protruding busts.
""You make love well wench,"" Admitted Grignr as he reached for the vessel of potent wine his charge had been quaffing. (c)
Q:
A flying foot caught the mug Grignr had taken hold of, sending its blood red contents sloshing over a flickering crescent; leashing tongues of bright orange flame to the foot trodden floor.
""Remove yourself Sirrah, the wench belongs to me;"" Blabbered a drunken soldier, too far consumed by the influences of his virile brew to take note of the superior size of his adversary.
Grignr lithly bounded from the startled female, his face lit up to an ashen red ferocity, and eyes locked in a searing feral blaze toward the swaying soldier.
""To hell with you, braggard!"" Bellowed the angered Ecordian, as he hefted his finely honed broad sword. (c)
Q:
The eyeballs glare turned to a sudden plea of mercy, a plea for the whole of humanity. Then the blob began to quiver with violent convulsions; the eyeball shattered into a thousand tiny fragments and evaporated in a curling wisp of scarlet mist. The very ground below the thing began to vibrate and swallow it up with a belch.
The thing was gone forever. All that remained was a dark red blotch upon the face of the earth, blotching things up. Shaking his head, his shaggy mane to clear the jumbled fragments of his mind, Grignr tossed the limp female over his shoulder. Mounting one of the disgruntled mares, and leading the other; the weary, scarred barbarian trooted slowly off into the horizon to become a tiny pinpoint in a filtered filed of swirling blue mists, leaving the Nobles, soldiers and peasants to replace the missing monarch. Long leave the king!!! (c)

PS. It's supposedly fanfiction on some or other fantasy (Conan-barbarian style) allegedly written by a 16-year old boy, There's another version of it: that this was a winner of a college contest on which of the students would write the most horrible novelette with most of the don'ts done.

Basically it's a novelette, interspersed with the horriblest of the impossible word and world choices, lots of typos, crazy syntax and weirdest pretty much everything about it. It's so horrible it's almost endearing. :) And one absolutely can't read it without cracking up! :)"
The Eye of Argon,Jilly,"December 31, 2017",5.0,"For my last finished book of 2017, and my 300th book read this year, I wanted to finish with a bang. A masterpiece of literary goodness.

This book is named ""The Worst Fantasy Book of All Time"" and rightly so. It is amazingly bad. So bad that as I read it aloud to my daughter this evening, I had to keep stopping to catch my breath and wipe the tears from my face from laughing so hard.

The Eye of Argon,Geek Furioso,"February 13, 2021",1.0,"Lee El Ojo de Argón en directo, me dijeron. Será divertido, me dijeron.

*se hace una bola y llora en el suelo*"
The Eye of Argon,EA Solinas,"April 30, 2011",1.0,"""The Eye of Argon"" is a legendary piece of fiction. It may look like just another lame ""Conan the Barbarian"" ripoff...

... but it isn't. This is the Holy Grail of wretched fantasy, the Excalibur of excrescent writing, the purest form of terrible writing that makes Edward Bulwer-Lytton look like Shakespeare. Jim Theis' legendary novella butchers the English language and wallows in the blood -- and I defy anyone to read this story in one sitting without experiencing fatal brain meltage.

It is the story of Grignr (how do you say that anyway?), a barbarian who hacks'n'slashes his way to the city of Gorzam, ""hoping to discover wine, women, and adventure to boil the wild blood coarsing through his savage veins."" Yeah, whatever. So he starts a fight over some random ""wench"" in Gorzam, and ends up sitting in prison while a bunch of priests try to rape and sacrifice a girl. Of course, he starts causing trouble like all hot-blooded barbarians do.

Well, that's sort of the story -- if you can call it a story, which is difficult to do because frankly Theis seems to have made it up as he went along. Admittedly he was only sixteen when he wrote ""Eye of Argon,"" but let's face it -- there isn't a single solitary SENTENCE in this book that doesn't make me want to stab myself in the brain with a fork.

Not that that's always a BAD thing. In fact, ""Eye of Argon"" is gutsplittingly funny and is used as a sort of genre joke.

Most of this comes from the way that Jim Theis... well, he did to the English language what Carthena does to the evil priest. Just look at the very first scene of the book. We've got a ""misting brain,"" ""grinding lungs"" and ""writhing mouths,"" not to mention ""Grignr's emerald green orbs glared lustfully at the wallowing soldier."" So, he's sexually attracted to the guy he just killed?

And it's like that ALL THROUGH THE BOOK. Random adjectives are slapped around (a girl has a ""lithe, opaque nose""), verbs are slaughtered (Carthena ""husked"" a remark), adverbs are beaten senseless (how do you ask something ""bustily?"") and the dialogue may cause your eyeballs to bleed. Who could write a line like, ""You make love well, wench""?

But let's be honest here -- this book would be a disaster even if Theis weren't that bad a writer -- the ""plot"" is incoherent and apparently made-up as it goes along, with absurd plot twists (killing people with a RAT PELVIS?) and long infodumps of boring blabber. What's more: it doesn't even have an end.

Even if they tried their hardest, most people couldn't write a story as hilariously, mind-blowingly horrible as ""The Eye of Argon."" Warning: if you read it, you might end up worming agonizingly as you utter a gasping gurgle."
The Eye of Argon,sologdin,"March 14, 2013",1.0,"Prefer an ""engrossed titan"" who ignores ""the queries of an inquisitive female, pulling her towards him and crushing her sagging nipples to his yearning chest""?

Want your narrator's consciousness to return ""in stygmatic pools as his mind gradually cleared of the cobwebs cluttering its inner recesses, yet the stygian cloud of charcoal ebony remained""?

Obsessed with ""expertly chisled forms of grotesque gargoyles that graced the oblique rim protruberating the length of the grim orifice of death, staring forever ahead into nothingness in complete ignorance of the bloody rites enacted in their prescence""?

Desire to see the villain ""clutching his urinary gland as his knees wobbled rapidly about for a few seconds then buckled, causing the ruptured shaman to collapse in an egg huddled mass to the granite pavement, rolling helplessly about in his agony""?

Then you must join this quest for ""the many fauceted scarlet emerald,"" posthaste.


Just awesome. Would be five stars had Delaney told it true that it's intentional satire. As Theis was a real guy, poor thing, it's on the other end of Poe's Law."
The Eye of Argon,Hollis Williams,"December 6, 2010",3.0,"For as long as I can remember, it has always been an ambition of mine to find an artifact whose existence is denied by many: the Worst Book Ever Written. I have spent countless hours going through libraries and charity bookshops in search of it and today, I'm glad to say that I finally found it. I give you ''The Eye of Argon'': a work of transcendent, dizzying, sublime badness. I'll pick two sentences at random to give you an idea of the quality:

(This is after the main character Grignr the Barbarian has fatally injured a soldier). ''Grignr's emerald green orbs glared lustfully at the wallowing soldier struggling before his chestnut swirled mount''.

''The vile stench of the Shaman's hot fetid breath over came the nauseated female with a deep soul searing sickness, causing her to wrench her head backwards and regurgitate a slimy, orangewhite stream of swelling gore over the richly woven purple robe of the enthused acolyte''.

I haven't laughed so much whilst reading a book in a very long time. Absolutely hilarious. And I love that in the Introduction, Mr Theis apparently took the story to his English teacher after he had written it so it could be improved. Bro, your English teacher can't fix this story: the only thing that can fix this is a flamethrower."

The Eye of Argon,paper,"February 19, 2014",4.0,"Normally, I fall for literature with well-developed characters, a cracking plot, an imaginative or imaginatively depicted setting, and a writing style that is seamless and natural, yet unique.

In The Eye of Argon, the only thing developed about the characters are their breasts and muscles. The plot is not so much cracking as cracked. The setting is imaginatively named, if not imaginative. And the writing style... well, it ain't natural, but it sure is unique.

In short, it's the worst piece of writing I've ever encountered. And for that, I love it. Seriously, it's one of the most unintentionally hilarious things in existence. And you can download it as a PDF for free.

The Eye of Argon is the (short) tale of Grignr the Ecordian, a barbarian warrior of enormous height, build and loincloth capacity. After sating his bloodlust by murdering a couple of soldiers, he goes to sate his regular lust in a brothel. Or maybe it's a tavern - I don't think Theis knew the difference. He snuggles up with a harlot who has 'stringy twines of orchid hair flowing gracefully over [her] lithe, opaque nose', only to be challenged by a drunk soldier. The man calls Grignr a slut, so he beheads him. Grignr is then escorted to see the ruler of Noregolia, a fat man who can blush and go pale at the same time and whose 'flabs of jellied blubber pulsate to and fro in ripples of flowing terror', whatever that means. After killing the king's advisor, Grignr is thrown into a dungeon. In order to escape, he must manually decapitate bloodthirsty giant rats, rescue swooning women from epileptic priests, spout completely nonsensical dialogue, steal a 'scarlet emerald', fight off eldritch leeches, and keep bone daggers in his G-string without slicing off his testicles. And he must do it in purple prose, surrounded by drawings as ugly and bizarre as the story itself.

If you enjoy B-movies, Tara Gillesbie's 'My Immortal', or laughing until your stomach hurts, you will love The Eye of Argon."
The Eye of Argon,Ɛɾιɳ ẞҽҽ,"April 1, 2020",5.0,"This is the most entertaining story I've ever had the pleasure of reading. My face hurts from laughing so hard, and for so long, that tears rolled down my cheeks and I discovered muscles that I didn't even know I had 😂😂😂😂 Pure gold.

It made me sad to learn that the author was emotionally devastated by the knowledge that people were mocking his story. I wish he could have seen it the way that I see it.

You see, I wrote some godawful cheesy stuff when I was a teenager, too (and when I was an adult 😜). That's common, right? But whenever I discover something cringe-worthy that I wrote 25 years ago, I get immense enjoyment from guffawing at my old self, then showing it to other people so that they can chuckle and hoot along with me 😁

I wish that could have appreciated this for the legendary relic that it now is. He deserved to feel honored by it. Sadly, his feelings were crushed and he declared that he would never write another story, then died in his late 40s. That breaks my heart 😢😢😢😢 If I'd had the opportunity to meet him, I would have explained why he should keep writing stories. I'm willing to bet he would have become a brilliant fantasy writer if he hadn't given up on his dream.

So, I laughed-'til-I-cried all the way through but it certainly wasn't mean-spirited. I was aware that it had been written by a 16-year-old and I appreciated it through that lens. If he were my child, I would have been proud of him (and perhaps a bit disturbed by his obsession with naked tavern wenches 😝) because Jim Theis was a creative teenager whose imagination could have taken him anywhere, with a little guidance and encouragement.

""The man upon the throne had a naked wench seated at each of his arms, and a trusted advisor seated in back of him. At each cornwr of the chamber a guard stood at attention, with upraised pikes supported in their hands, golden chainmail adorning their torso's and barred helmets emitting scarlet plumes enshrouding their heads.

Not a book to actually *read*, but it sure is fun to find bits like this! All text quoted verbatim, from a copy that used to be online.

From the [formerly] online copy, accessed 2006:
' ""The Eye of Argon"" was published in 1970 in OSFAN, the journal of the Ozark SF Society, issue number 10. Photocopies circulated for decades, and it became a regular sf convention challenge to read Jim Theis's mangled prose with a straight face. ... Jim Theis himself, who was 16 when ""The Eye of Argon"" first appeared, reportedly died circa 2001 at age 48. He will be long remembered in sf fandom.'

The Eye of Argon,Steve Dilks,"February 10, 2017",5.0,"I first came across reference to this novella in a Dave Langford article in SFX magazine when I was standing in Tesco a few years ago. From that day on I was intrigued. Being a massive fan of sword-&-sorcery I just knew had to track this book down. Eventually I came across it online and, in all excitement, prepared myself. I was not disappointed. Gloriously bad prosed fun, full of relentless action and carnage that, regardless of intention or not, does the genre a mighty service by giving it a right royal kick up the rear. I loved it. If you have ever read Lin Carter or Gardner F. Fox you could easily be fooled into thinking this was an early draft of one of their novels. They wrote some stinkers and, as this proves, most of them could have been written by a sixteen year old school boy with a healthy fixation for big breasted women. I've read many tales of hot blooded, lusty barbarians with mighty thews in my time and far from ridiculing this novella - I salute THE EYE OF ARGON for the masterpiece it truly is. So here's to you and your roaring red maned barbarian, Grignr of Ecordia, Jim! Tonight I shall hoist a slatternly wench with sagging breasts on my knee and glug a sweaty tankard in your honour!"
The Eye of Argon,Alyssa,"November 13, 2014",3.0,"I mean, how do you rate The Eye of Argon? Do you give it five stars for being SO BAD that it made you laugh so hard your kidneys hurt, or do you give it only the none stars it deserves for its ""quality"" level? I compromised. Which, unfortunately, makes the thing look readable. It really isn't.

Do not read this unless you have a strong stomach for bad writing and don't mind misogyny, flat characterization, an utter lack of plot, and just mammoth narrative leaps in general. Yes, it *does* read like it was written by an angry, semi-literate 13-year-old boy. And yes, it is something close to hysterical that even the author of this... work could consider it good enough to publish. If these facts are intriguing enough and you have the stomach for it in the name of a hard laugh, well. Enter at your own risk."
The Eye of Argon,Dejo,"January 4, 2022",5.0,"I give it five stars not to be ironic or edgy or to claim it's so bad it's good (it's not, it's really not, I cannot stress how much it isn't good and is bad). I give it five stars because this is a book everyone should read. And by everyone I mean Gary Oldman in Luc Bessson's ""Leon the Professional"" EVERYONE!
I don't even know what to write about this book because any example I could list of how and why it's bad is incomparable to the experience of reading it.
The writing is so bad that my own vocabulary feels drained and I have great difficulty writing this review so shortly after having read this book.
Words are hard.
Go read this book."
The Eye of Argon,Marc *Dark Reader of the Woods*,"January 27, 2023",1.0,"LOVED IT. On a word-choice level, absolutely the hilariously worst thing ever written. On some other levels, unfortunately I have *kind of* read worse? Because this is at least 1) short; 2) it follows the format of a typical Conan story, which it purported to emulate, and with the basic plot points and intended characterization, it could have been passable if written by someone who was not a complete fool.

I am sad that I cannot add this to my ""self-published manatee abortion"" bookshelf, because it was not self-published, if that is to be believed.

I will read the supplementary essays in at a later date, but at a glance, I strongly recommend them for anyone who is unfamiliar with this seminal work of fantasy, to understand how it cemented its place in literary history."
The Eye of Argon,Joey,"January 27, 2015",1.0,"I DNF, but did finish. The novel is terrible, the essays funny. It's more a joke piece for me now but I can't focus on it properly. So to dafuk shelf with you for later reading. 1 star is joke rating. The book can't be judged by mortal constraints.

Eyeing a slender female crouched alone at a nearby bench, Grignr advanced wishing to wholesomely occupy his time. The flickering torches cast weird shafts of luminescence dancing over the half naked harlot of his choice, her stringy orchid twines of hair swaying gracefully over the lithe opaque nose, as she raised a half drained mug to her pale red lips.

That death rattle you hear is a Thesaurus dying to supply this monstrosity the words it needs to carry on."

The Eye of Argon,Eric Woods,"October 6, 2017",5.0,"This is the greatest story I have ever read. Not because it’s good – it most certainly is not – but because it pushes through bad to terrible to execrable to emerge on the other side gloriously, hilariously awful. It is the Andy Dufrane of books. It crawled through a mile of shit to make something amazing. It is the literary equivalent of The Room. The words are in English but you aren’t sure whether the author understood them or was some kind of alien attempting to write human literature. The Eye of Argon is what you would get if you stuffed Conan and a thesaurus into a blender with purple food coloring then hit frappe. You could write as sensible a story by every time you needed a descriptive word or a name just shaking out a can full of Scrabble letters and putting in whatever comes out.

There is no way to prepare someone for what they will experience with The Eye of Argon. It is an indescribable thing. The maddening reach for the most archaic of terms and inevitably choosing the wrong one. The spelling errors that were so bad that I actually had to cross reference to make sure I didn’t have a bad copy. I did not. The contradicting, melodramatic descriptions. Every interaction sounds like a robot trying to understand human mating rituals. This is the chaos inside a schizophrenics mind. Nothing makes any sense and the words tumble out in the most laughable word salad mankind has ever produced."
The Eye of Argon,Icebrand,"November 24, 2014",,"I am unable or unwilling to give a star rating to this book. I know that it is no work of intentional triumph, but I have never enjoyed any sentences as much as these two calamities from The Eye Of Argon:

* Consciousness returned to Grignr in stygmatic pools as his mind gradually cleared of the cobwebs cluttering its inner recesses, yet the stygian cloud of charcoal ebony remained. An incompatible shield of blackness, enhanced by the bleak abscense of sound.

* ""Aye! The ways of our civilization are in many ways warped and distorted, but what is your calling,"" she queried, bustily?

Many of my friends love writing in amateur pastiche, for a laugh. None of them in a million years could have come up with malaprops so perfect as a gemstone with ""masterfully-cut faucets."" This book is both a 1 star and a 5 star, and everyone should read it."
The Eye of Argon,Erika,"March 3, 2013",1.0,"We've all seen movies that are ""so bad it's good."" I never thought a book could accomplish that same level of horrible wonderfulness, until I read this work. I fell into the dilemma everyone else had in what rating to give it. On one hand, it is just worst book ever in the world. The worst writing ever. The worst typos ever. The worst use of a thesaurus ever. I am convinced that people who are learning to write should read this work at some point in order to learn what NOT to do. But on the other hand, it is just so entertaining, so ambitious, so wonderful. After all, any book that has a chapter 3 1/2 and 7 1/2 deserves all the praise in the world. I would never recommend this book to anyone ever. But seriously, I recommend it."
The Eye of Argon,Daniel R.,"April 24, 2012",3.0,"The Eye of Argon is infamous for both its big ambitions and many shortcomings. It is also a fine way to spend an hour. Not reading it at home alone, no no no. The book is so godawful, I would not wish such an experience on my worst enemy. It becomes entertaining when a group of con goers sit around in a circle and try to read it aloud AS WRITTEN. That is, every mistake must be incorporated into the reading or else your turn is done and the next reader gives it a go. That experience, filled with laughter and good natured jibes and snark, make The Eye of Argon a worthwhile . . . construction. I don't recommend being exposed to it in any other way."
The Eye of Argon,Richard,"November 25, 2020",1.0,"This short story, which sounds like a very bad imitation of Robert E. Howard, Edgar Rice Burroughs or Fritz Leiber, is an object lesson in how NOT to write fantasy. This is so ridiculously horrible that it seems to have its own cult following. Blood gushes forth in torrents, beefy barbarians perform impossible feats, dastardly despots snarl nastily, horrid idols glimmer luridly, swords and scimitars sweep dangerously, curvaceous wenches query bustily, and so forth.

""The barbarian seated himself upon a stool at the wenches side, exposing his body, naked save for a loin cloth brandishing a long steel broad sword, an iron spiraled battle helmet, and a thick leather sandals, to her unobstructed view.""

""With a nauseating thud the severed oval toppled to the floor, as the segregated torso of Grignr's bovine antagonist swayed, then collapsed in a pool of swirled crimson.""
*
""The fat prince stood undulating in insurmountable fear before the edge of the fiery maned comet, his flabs of jellied blubber pulsating to and fro in ripples of flowing terror.""
*
""fetid breath scortching the sqirming barbarians dilating nostrils. Grignr grappled with the lashing flexor muscles of the repugnant body of a garganuan brownhided rat, striving to hold its razor teeth from his juicy jugular,""

""Grignr slipped his right hand to his thigh, concealing a small opaque object beneath the folds of the g-string wrapped about his waist.""
*
""Grignr percieved a scene which caused his blood to smolder not unlike bubbling, molten lava.""

*
""Raising it toward the sun he said, ""We shall do well with bauble, eh!""

"" All that remained was a dark red blotch upon the face of the earth, blotching things up.""

For all the adjectives, large words, and run-on sentences, I can't lie to you and say I wasn't able to see exactly what was going on inside my head. This kind of moving imagery is insane. It's like watching a movie with audio description turned on read by a crazy narrorator who gets caught up in every minute detail. And for that and all the fun it gave me, I added half a star (but none more than that. It is infuriating to me that books like this give self-publishing a bad reputation)."
The Eye of Argon,Lauren,"December 18, 2017",2.0,"I was expecting worse, to be honest. Yeah, the writing is terrible, but after a while you kinda get used to it and then the more significant crime is just how boring the story is, especially the part where Grignr is stuck in the dungeon. Still, I don't think I've ever laughed so much during a book. The damsel in distress character was particularly bad. It was like the author saw one of those old movie posters where the women are sprawled on the ground clutching the legs of the hero, then he transplanted that image into his story, only more naked and without adding any other characterising detail.

Some top moments:



And



Also, every instance of writing 'orbs' or (I shit you not) 'seeing organs' instead of 'eyes'.
The main character gets called a slut a lot, too, and I know it's going for some archaic meaning, but still, that never got old."
The Eye of Argon,Taylor Green,"April 15, 2014",1.0,"What abject horror is contained within these pages! The atrocities of prose, punctuation, hyphenation...words fail me to describe what is proclaimed as a major candidate for ""the Worst Story Ever Written."" If I were rating this book based on ""intentionally horrendous committing of literary atrocities,"" this story would have gotten five stars. When the spellings and repetitions, misuses and hyphenations have you questioning even the ""correct"" words you come across and mispronouncing actual words, you know you've stumbled upon a ""gem royal."" I've read few truly horrible stories (such as this story: ) which were written that way intentionally, but I'm glad to have found possibly the lowest drivel of writing to have withstood, and in fact been embraced by, modern readers. This work is now a definite part of the standard by which I judge truly horrible literature."
The Eye of Argon,Jack Holman,"March 14, 2023",,"To the right sort of person, “The Eye of Argon” may need no introduction, but it certainly does warrant an explanation.

This story is infamous for being possibly the worst fantasy story, if not the worst piece of fiction, ever written. A sort of My Immortal for the 70s fanzine era. First published in OSFAN, an Ozark area fanzine, in 1970, the story was copied, shared, and mocked to the point that at least one radio show hosted on-air readings by the mid-1980s. Sci-fi and fantasy conventions hosted “readings” which became a sort of party game where readers must attempt to read aloud for as long as possible without laughing. People speculated if it was written in earnest or if the work was some genius piece of satire.

The story was written by a 16-year-old.

As far as I, and Wikipedia, can tell, the story entered the public domain in the United States the moment it was published. The fanzine it was printed in appeared without a copyright notice, a requirement for copyright protection in the U.S. until 1978. As such, it seems to be perfectly legal (in the United States at least, I’m numb on how international copyright might apply) to replicate and monetise the work. In the 80s and 90s, the story was reprinted a few times without any mention of the author, Jim Theis, despite the original zine correctly crediting him. Following the author’s death in 2002, the story has since been reprinted with full credit, though I can’t comment on whether or not any money is making its way to the author’s heirs. Speaking as a huge advocate for the public domain, and admitting that any publishers who monetise this (within the United States) are within their legal right… I can’t help but kinda get the ick about the whole thing.

I’ve heard varying accounts of the author’s reaction to his story’s infamy. It’s hard to track down accurate citations for this sort of thing. A lot of the knowledge that’s accumulated boils down to people on old BBS posts saying “such and such told me that so and so met someone at a con once who said this”. Some have said that the author was a good sport about the whole thing, himself participating in some readings of his work. The Wikipedia page for this story claims, without citation, that in one interview the author claimed he was so hurt by the mockery that he would never write again. Darrell Schweitzer, in his essay “One Fine Day in the Stygian Haunts of Hell: Being the Lore and Legend of the Fabled ‘The Eye of Argon’”, poses the question of the morality of making a mockery of such a work, before going on to answer his own question with the sentiment that “Life ain’t a bed of roses”. I personally disagree with this view. Saying that life isn’t fair might in itself be a true statement, but it isn’t an excuse to continue making life worse for others when presented with the opportunity not to. Again, people are within their rights, but I can’t help but feel the morals of this whole thing might be a bit greyer than some would care to admit.

So, having read it, is it as bad as everyone says? Well, yeah. It’s bad. It’s really, really bad. I don’t want to spend too long dwelling on it for two main reasons. Firstly, because a thousand people before me have already pointed and laughed at descriptions of a ""red emerald” or one character’s “lithe, opaque nose”, but mostly I just don’t really feel comfortable making fun of this. Again, this was written by a 16-year-old. Even so, I’m not sure how much of the criticism to level towards the author here. In an interview which I have a citation for, the author states that “The editing that was done to it [The Eye of Argon] did not help it. In the future, if I have anything else published I would appreciate it if it were published as it was written”, which gives me some reason to believe that a good deal of the errors present in the text may not be the fault of the author.

So yes, it’s bad. Obviously. Of course, it’s bad. It was written by a 16-year-old. What did you expect? The fact someone that young even had the patience to write something this long without scraping it is, honestly, impressive. In an interview published in a later issue of , the author was humble enough to say that Argon was “nothing to be proud of and yet it is. Because… [h]ow many writers have written a complete story at so early an age?” He’s absolutely right. Do you have any idea how many totally definitely gonna be great novels I started writing at 16 that never saw more than a page? Thankfully all of those are long deleted, lest anyone rob my hard drive and make a party game out of laughing at them.

I usually refrain from rating things on Goodreads only because I’m not a literary critic and have admittedly little understanding of what does and doesn’t work about the written word. That said, I’m refraining from rating this not because I don’t feel equipped to judge its quality, but because I don’t feel judging the work of a 16-year-old. If only to offset my own sense of shame from purchasing a paperback of this work, I’ve donated an amount equal to what I paid for it to the American Heart Association, donations to whom were requested by family in the author’s obituary. I would humbly suggest that anyone else who may take enjoyment out of the story, at the author’s expense or otherwise, do the same. Good on Jim Theis for getting this written and getting it published in any form. Encourage young writers."
The Eye of Argon,Gini,"October 11, 2009",1.0,"It would be misleading to list this book as anything but dreadful, but it is dreadful in such an entertaining way that it almost deserves to be rated awesome. It is the magnificence of bad. Ferrett read it to me in the car driving back from Massachusetts and I laughed so hard that I almost drove off the road."
The Eye of Argon,Brian,"February 17, 2014",,"A breathtaking masterwork of whimsicorically astounding beauty. My orb-shaped organs of sight could not believe their good fortune when I began reading this epic tale.

The Eye of Argon,Jonathan,"September 4, 2021",2.0,"This is the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of books. Its terrible writing is legendary and really must be read to be believed.

The Eye of Argon,Kiara Entelecheia,"April 7, 2020",2.0,"Повестта, печално известна като „най-лошото фентъзи на всички времена“, си е насъбрала интересна анти-фенбаза, докато паралелно попада и в so-bad-it's-good графата. Един вид, би трябвало да е книжният еквивалент на The Room с Томи Уайзоу.
Ами с такива надежди ѝ бях хвърлила око...
В действителност, много повече ми напомни на една сцена от „Приятели“, където Джоуи, в желанието си да напише интелигентно писмо, беше използвал синонимния речник за всяка дума... В резултат на което „They're warm, nice people with big hearts.“ беше станало „They're humid, prepossessing Homo sapiens with full-sized aortic pumps.“ , че и накрая се беше подписал като „baby kangaroo“ (вместо Joey). И въпрос на вкус, разбира се, ама на мен тази шега ми хареса, основно защото не трая повече от три минути. Сега си представете цял епизод... абе, какво епизод, цял сезон всъщност, в който всички говорят така. Не е смешно, досадно е. Също като тази книга.
Идея нямам защо е толкова популярна. Да, книгата е зле, но не е най-лошата книга, която съм чела, просто е глупава и съдържа в себе си всеки пример как не бива да се пише... Всъщност дори не съм сигурна, че мога да я нарека „книга“ – не е като наистина да е издавана, преди да придобие култовия си статус. Та откъде тоя... чак гняв? Допускам, че има общо с доста противен ми феномен, вид съпричастен хейт, в който хората мразят страстно нещо само защото е социално приемливо да се мрази. Сещам се за „Здрач“, Паулу Куелю, Ребека Блек (оная с Friday), Джъстин Бийбър, Никълбек и там подобните им. Не че тези неща не са лоши като продукт сами по себе си, но далеч не са най-ужасното нещо, което се е случвало на света, нито пък са достойни да се мерят с великата катастрофичност на The Room. Ама що пък да не им сипем безплатно, докато удобно пренебрегваме стократно по-гадните боклуци, които се бълват ежечасно? Ако не друго, съпричастният хейт ми е доста любопитен пример за стаден манталитет.
Което ми напомня: време ми е да прочета „Здрач“ най-накрая."
The Eye of Argon,Knowlton Murphy,"March 21, 2023",1.0,"Amazing. It's nice to be able to point at a specific work as the actual standard for worst possible fantasy literature. Spoilers but this last paragraph is pretty representative of the whole story. Bask in its glory.

""The thing was gone forever. All that remained was a dark red blotch upon the face of the earth, blotching things up. Shaking his head, his shaggy mane to clear the jumbled fragments of his mind, Grignr tossed the limp female over his shoulder. Mounting one of the disgruntled mares, and leading the other; the weary, scarred barbarian trooted slowly off into the horizon to become a tiny pinpoint in a filtered filed of swirling blue mists, leaving the Nobles, soldiers and peasants to replace the missing monarch. Long leave the king !!!!"""
The Eye of Argon,Heart DeCoupeville,"August 9, 2022",5.0,"Terrible writing in The Eye of Argon, but invaluable lessons for the would-be writer in the supporting material. Sadly, few will learn them."
Stones To Abbigale,Sarah,"November 13, 2015",1.0,"Surprisingly, a 30-year old man who made an entire career out of mocking and exploiting vulnerable people has no understanding of another's pain other than to boost his own ego. That much is clear when all of his ex- and current girlfriends were abused at one point, allowing Onision the role of the savior. So this leads to the broken bird Abbi, whose only role is to prove protagonist James's godhood. James, as Onision reiterates ad nauseam, is a teenage Onision who's somehow better. Granted, that's a very low standard. Onision unintentionally proves that by making James a judgmental creep who treats everyone other than Abbi as useless ""creatures"" on autopilot and completely irrelevant to his sole purpose - getting Abbi. He doesn't care if people around him were killed, if his family were happy, as long as he gets some from his girlfriend. He loves her, despite her lack of personality, and spends every single moment of the book thinking obsessively about her (which, coming from a ""writer"" who hasn't read a book in 14 years, ends up reading like drafting deep Tumblr posts). Surprisingly, Onision realizes he can't mock her here - or maybe that's just his teenage savior complex preventing him from seeing Abbi as the actual person (who he based her on, nonetheless).

Obviously, a man who cannot even use commas correctly in a sentence will not sell on merit. That might explain why the blurb is entirely Onision insisting that IT'S ONISION writing an AUTOBIOGRAPHY, and much of his focus is on how he feels about his/James's past rather than actual events. With a novel, originality and skill determines its success and the author's fame. With autobiographies, Gregory Jackson is free to shamelessly promote it on every page he owns and his fanbase of 11-14 year old girls whose entire knowledge of life is second-hand from Taylor Swift choruses will eat it up.

However, that still doesn't excuse directly responding angrily to reviews (especially making up conversations between him and reviewers): See his Tumblr.

Let's look at the actual book. ""I walked quickly down the hall towards my art class, which was awkwardly placed in a trailer outside my clearly poorly funded high school."" That's 4 adverbs in one sentence. ""Walked quickly"" could be replaced with ""hurried"" or any variation thereof. The rest of the sentence isn't directly related to what James is doing, so it should be either short or a separate sentence.

You could literally set your watch to whenever one of Onision's phrases pop up. ""Literally"" is just the tip of the iceberg; he addresses ""most everyone"" ""on a daily basis"" ""in a ____ tone"" and doing what he thinks is ""dorky.""

Onision also does not split his paragraphs or sentences correctly. ""On my way to the class a fight had already broken out between two jocks who, no doubt, both had controlling, iron-fisted fathers who brainwashed them into believing conflicts between men are best resolved with the bloodying of the fists."" Most of the sentence is unnecessary and non-descriptive, with very little supporting evidence (which is kind of the point of a story). The sentence runs on from a very brief description to a trite attempt at stream-of-consciousness which Onision does not manage well and ends up making James look like a prick. Much like Onision himself.

He fails one cardinal rule of paragraphs in fiction; one paragraph for each character. If James talks, the teacher's response should be in a different paragraph. With an opening chapter already rife with errors and so bland, it's not inexcusable that many readers would stop reading.

There are some terrible metaphors. He compares his mind to ""neon walls"" (?????) and visualizes his crush's face ""like a projector."" In the hands of a competent writer, the metaphor of James's mind as a theater may work well; instead it is clunky and completely fails at the purpose of a metaphor. Metaphors should reveal something about the character's personality, a theme, or simply set the atmosphere/allow the readers to visualize a certain scene. Also, they should not be pointing out something blindingly obvious (like that a plush toy bear doesn't give off the smell of real blood, which sounds almost like Onision's vegan tracts).

Onision takes enough pages out of c. 2007 ""teen fiction"" to make Stones To Abbigail accumulate more biomass than the entire teenage population of the United States. The result is some kind of monstrosity where jocks who say ""Dude I think John's done bro!"" are thrown together with the stereotypical developmentally delayed kid with disgusting behavior, the teacher who expresses absolutely no concern over said student, and a terrible guidance counselor (sadly, this is a bit closer to the truth than the rest of Onision's book). There's also James's best friend Davis whose only purpose is to worship and cater to his whims, such as standing up ""to give [James] the window seat."" The poor verb usage is compounded with the complete absence of personality of Davis. (I amused myself by imagining a scaled down version of Davis Aurini as Onision's best friend)

As for the plot, literally nothing happens. James has a dream where the girl he likes is screaming so he emails a love letter to her, talking about how he alone can heal all of her scars (exact same letter Onision wrote to a girl also named Abbi in high school). She rightfully chews him out for unwarranted white-knighting, then suddenly confides in him. There's a school shooting by Abbi's abusive ex Seth after she breaks up with him, and she has no reaction to the deaths of 52 students other than physical contact with James. 52 students, shot in the head. Just for perspective, the highest death toll of a school shooting by a single perpetrator is 32 students (Seung Hui Cho at Virginia Tech). Onision gets nearly everything wrong about school shootings; first of all, so many shootings and other things happen that there's no way the President would visit every school where a shooting occurs. Secondly, the symptoms of shock are wrong (crying while escaping isn't a symptom). Finally, none of the characters are shown to react at all.

Onision needs to proofread, read some books (apparently his own book was the first he read in 14 years, explaining why so much of it seemed to come out of Tumblr posts), and also learn empathy and deflate his ego."
Stones To Abbigale,Jiessie,"February 5, 2018",5.0,"THE BEST BOOK YOU WILL EVER PICK UP. DEFINITELY AN HOUR WELL SPENT.

I freakin' loved this book. I loved how not once in the entire story does James mention what Abbigale look like. Seriously. Not even once. All I know is that she has hair and eyes and two arms and two legs. Just like me!

Davis is not creepy at all. He does not exist solely to tell James how great he is, and how much he loves him. That's not creepy, that's you know. Love. We definitely (do not) learn about Davis in a setting other than the bus that James goes on every day. I also know that Davis has hair and eyes. Not sure about the arms and legs though.

James is 17 and he likes Abbigale because she is pretty. He also magically gains superpowers when he needs to protect his girlfriend from mean people because she can't fend for herself.

Basically, they are living in a strange world called Dreamwork and James likes to stay by himself. He has a best friend named Davis and we know that he is his best friend because Davis has no other personality except for kissing James's arse. James falls in love with a beautiful princess Abbigale, and together, they defeat jocks and meanies who don't want them to be together. The jock (who will stay un-named due to privacy reasons) wants to date Abbigale but James got to her first.

Whew... There are so many characters to keep straight.

Oh yeah, there might have been a school shooting or something, frankly, I don't remember because it wasn't really interesting."
Stones To Abbigale,Kristin,"April 2, 2015",1.0,"James our lovely protagonist of this book is a 17 year old JR in high school. He has some sort of god complex, he studies his classmates at hates everyone (except for Abbigale, a girl he is obsessed with and his friend Davis who worships him). This could because A. hes a judgmental jerk or B. hes actually an alien sent here to study human teenagers and fall in love. If you read the book through this lens, it becomes more interesting.

Abbigale, the love interest of the main character is a typical damsel in distress. She has no real personality besides the trauma she has gone through. James has to constantly save her. He saves her from her ex, who shoots up their school, her father who is an abusive alcoholic, a jock who grabs her ass and a the crazy school counselor who later decides to burn down the school for some reason. Besides all this, Abbi never develops a personality. Abbi doesn't really do anything besides cry and take showers at James' house.

Then there is Davis, the weird kid that is supposed to be funny who says things like ""How can I turn that frown upside down? Poopy poo poop?"" (that's a direct quote, I'm not kidding.) Davis' hobbies include: riding the school bus, cheering up James, organizing his legos by color, and worshiping James.

Then there is the school shooting. No one we know dies. Nor does it really further the plot. Sure, James saves Abbi while shuffling through the school in his socks, but there is no real reason for it to happen, in fact nothing in the plot changes the main characters in anyway. It's just stuff that happens.

Despite the hardship Abbi and James go through, they don't really change at all. They witness a school shooting, a man committing suicide and Jame's best friend getting hit by a car trying to save the man who committed suicide. Then their school burns down. Abbi says this about the trauma she's endured ""I feel like, at this point most bad things that happen wont really hurt us unless we let them.""
So, everyone, if you experience horrible trauma like miscarriage, a school shooting or witness your best friend getting hit by a car, don't let it hurt you and you'll be fine."
Stones To Abbigale,Daeni,"July 29, 2015",1.0,"This is by far the worst book I have ever read.
The protagonist James is a total psychopath and hates everyone but a girl in his artclass.
I would describe their looks but the author never ever describes how any of the characters look.
A lot of life changing things happen to them but nobody ever changes, the dialogues are terribly written, the characters have no development or characteristics whatsoever and it's hard to empathize with any of them.
There is no red line through the story, just things happen and awkward talking and everyone praising the protagonist and end.
There is no moral, no good feeling the reader is left with and I assure you that you will never think of the characters again (you will most likely have forgotten their names instantly anyways) or pick up the book for a second read.
Even as a first novel, this is just horrible and shameful."
Stones To Abbigale,James Tullos,"January 5, 2021",1.0,"I'm not reviewing this thing, so you can stop asking, I read it for purely academic purposes. The one positive I can say is that it feels... earnest. Like Onision thought he was saying something profound with it. He didn't, but he tried."
Stones To Abbigale,Hanna Maxwell,"April 3, 2015",1.0,"Not even adequate as a debut. The characters are as shallow as the authors internet presence and as unrealistic as his alleged online following which consists of 11-16 year old kids who worship him with their medication in one hand and razor blade in the other.
It figures the author would write about a self inflated and misunderstood teenage boy who is meant to come off as wise for his years and yet only comes off as a clear depiction of an egocentric legend in his own mind.
I kept waiting for aliens to land next, I mean I understand that action is required in a book, things have to occur to move plot but there is just so much going on here it is totally unrealistic. If just one thing was chosen such as the fire or one character helping another through a trying time or the school shooting or the best friend dying before his eyes...(sheesh) it might have been better. It seems that perhaps the author thought he could make up for the shallowness of his characters and his inability to write in an engaging way by piling one catastrophic event on top of another. Unfortunately, it didn't work. It's difficult to even care about the characters and the events meant to move the plot forward don't even move it slightly to the side. As mentioned, one of the myriad of events that happen in the story had it been done well could have made an excellent book, instead you get a book that has about everything that could happen to a teenager happening and it's a challenge to care.
This book will find an audience though, Onision's minions will eat it up, the 11-16 year old set gripping their razor blades and wallowing in a mass of their own imaginary problems will clamor for their copy. And this brings me to the message it seems that Onision is attempting in his mentally crippled way to get across, if you experience trauma you just have to let it go. As the leading poster child for therapy he wants this age old message to come off as profound when it really isn't. Even old school lessons can be presented to people in an inspiring way though, if the story is good, and this one wasn't. It's easy to say ""Let it go"" but Onision doesn't have the fortitude or wisdom to point out that in order to let go of a thing one must first pick it up.
I recommend waiting for this one to come out at your public library if you insist on reading it, that way you won't waste money, just time, and that, like everything, is a choice, right? Just return it on time, it isn't even worth the quarter you'll pay for the late charge."
Stones To Abbigale,Lodane,"November 26, 2018",1.0,"WELL I GUESS I CAN'T RUN FOR CLASS PRESIDENT, NOW."
Stones To Abbigale,Cheyenne,"June 15, 2015",1.0,"-This rant will contain spoilers.-

I actually read this entire book.

Why did I read this book???

I'm not going to get into a big detailed review or anything (maybe more of a rant), because I really don't want to relive this experience. But honestly, the entire time I was reading this book, I kept forgetting it was written by a grown man in his thirties. It reads EXACTLY like fan fiction written by a middle schooler. Actually, scratch that. I was probably writing better Harry Potter fan fiction when I was thirteen.

There is not a single likable character in this book. James is a self absorbed asshole. Abbi has the personality of a cardboard box. Jason and Chris were almost indistinguishable from each other. The teachers were all such incompetent assholes that it is completely unbelievable that these people would have jobs at all. I don't even want to get started on Davis honestly. All I can say is, my hatred for him reached the level of my disdain for Tiny in John Green and David Levithan's Will Grayson, Will Grayson, which says a hell of a lot. He was the epitome of the 'zomg so random!!11!' phase we all wish we could forget. Throughout the entire book I was convinced he was actually 5 years old, since, as far as I can remember, it was never stated how old he was.

There is really no conflict in this book. Sure, there's drama, but most of it lasts less than one chapter and is never mentioned again. You could argue that the shooting is mentioned throughout the book, but there are hardly any repercussions. No one we know dies, the students never seem to suffer any kind of emotional trauma after 52 STUDENTS ARE KILLED.

I also cannot get past how everything in this book revolves around James. Davis is unreasonably obsessed with him, and talks about nothing else. James is the only possible candidate for school president, even though he makes absolutely 0 good choices. Davis' mother talks about James more than she does about her own son in his eulogy. And I don't even want to talk about how terrible of a person James actually is. He is not phased in the slightest bit by such a staggering amount of classmates dying. He says himself that the only person he cares about in the world is Abbi. Their """"""""""relationship"""""""""" is more dangerous and unhealthy than Twilight and 50 Shades put together.

Anyway. I've ranted enough. I'll leave you with some choice quotes from everyone's favorite undeveloped character, Davis.

""How can I turn that frown upside poopy poo poop?""

“Hi ho silver lady mammy poppy sickle!”"
Stones To Abbigale,Sonder,"September 7, 2020",1.0,"For those on a leisurely scroll through, you may not know that I have edited this review. After stumbling across my hate-fulled, furious ramblings, I realised that I didn't make a whole lot of sense. Therefore, I'm rewriting it in a more coherent manner that will deliver in possibly more snark and sass than its predecessor because, despite spending two years trying to push this from my mind, my hatred for this book has only grown. It festers. Every time I think I've considered every aspect of this book that was poorly done, something else springs to mind. It is a tragedy that I am burdened by a character limit now.

I'm also amending an earlier statement that has since been rendered incorrect. After reading this shit show, I dug into Onision as a person and internet personality. Oh my fucking God. I've concluded from my research that he is, indeed, a narcissistic, arrogant, ignorant fuckwit with no talents whatsoever. This is important to highlight because it's tangential to his writing; all of his protagonists are narcissistic, arrogant, ignorant fuckwits who have so-called 'talents'. That is, saving 'broken girls' and having the impressive ability to get on every single one of my fucking nerves.

It should also be noted I was promptly suspended off of Twitter within a week of getting it because I replied to some of Greg's tweets. Some would call it cyber-bullying, I'd call it clowning an egocentric abuser who uses BDSM as a cover for his repulsive behaviour. A greasy Christian Grey without the good looks or the money, if you will.

Evidently, you have probably guessed that I don't think all that highly of this book. A fair assessment. Two years ago, I didn't have a system when it came to reviews, and I also was far more critical than nowadays. I was THAT kid. Even so, in this book, there's so much wrong with it that there's too much to wade through.

I'll start with the beginning. We've all heard to start your story with a gripping opening, something that grabs the reader and builds anticipation. You should take that first chapter to introduce yourprotagonist, the world, maybe even a glimpse at the plot. Onision does none of this. Instead, he chooses to wax philosophically to the reader about love and its purpose in our lives. Condescendingly explaining how the heart is a lock that needs the right key to open it. How it 'enlightens' us. All I got from this is that Greg is pretentious and so is his self-insert, James.

This little prick is one of the most irritating, bland, arrogant bastards I've ever had the displeasure of following in a novel. Ever. Aspiring writers, never replicate this shitstain for your protagonist, someone who talks down to the reader, all the while being a judgemental, unintelligent wet wipe of a human being, will never work out in your favour.

James believes he's the best thing to ever walk this earth. A true reflection of the author, who has some fantasy of being every edgy girl's wet dream. Throughout this book, James makes fake deep commentary wherever he can and comes off with edgy bullshit that had me rolling my eyes so hard, I nearly knocked myself out. He has a saviour complex that only fuelled my hatred for this book, and this is where I became truly disgusted with it.

His love interest, Abbigale, is a girl who suffers abuse throughout the novel. Upon his first descriptions of this chick, the first words that came to mind were trauma porn. I was going to be stuck reading trauma porn written by a thirty-something year old man. Great. I totally wasn't creeped out at the notion that a grown man was writing explicity about teenagers having sex after sharing their damage. Not. At. All.

What made this worse was that the story and romance reminded me of every edgy fanfic ever written by twelve year old girls on Wattpad, and that's being generous. The quality of this novel is so horrific that I could barely make out what was being said. Normally, I'll let self-published works get a pass on grammar mistakes here and there, but my dude was really taking the piss. There's whole sentences that aren't complete thoughts, and I was so lost.

The romance, as I said, is incredibly juvenile and very disconnected from reality. Abbigale self harms because she's depressed and severely abused by her boyfriend and drunkard father, which is awful on its own, but it doesn't GO anywhere. The most that happens is that her ex-boyfriend shoots up the school, and she's blamed for a chapter at most, way after the event happened. Don't worry, I'll be talking more on that later.

Her whole character is so boring, Greg clearly thought stuffing emotional baggage onto her would make her mysterious and desirable, or even interesting. Turns out, my desensitised ass took three weeks to slug through this book because I was so bored. She has no life to her, she's a walking mess of trauma with a vagina attached. It's incredibly misogynistic.

There's a scene where she shows him her scars, in one of the most uncomfortable reveals I've ever read. He says something like she's perfectly imperfect and kisses them, and I gagged. This kid, this little fucker is out here pretending like this girl's serious mental health issues can be soothed by his affections. As I said, a truly disgusting saviour complex. The truth is, a teenager won't know how to really help someone that emotionally damaged, and the right thing to do would be to encourage them to get help. It is not James' responsibility to 'fix' her. It isn't anybody's responsibility to play caretaker at that age. Just because you love someone doesn't mean you can solve their problems.

The plot twist of her character is, you guessed it, more trauma! Turns out she was raped multiple times, she fell pregnant and confided in the school counselor, who scorned her for wanting an abortion. Her abusive boyfriend punched her until she miscarried and the school counselor is pro-life so she hates Abbi now because she thinks it was a conspiracy between the couple so they didn't have to have the kid.

Of course, James finds this super hot because they're both so broken and lonely, you know? They get each other. In reality, James attaches himself to this emotionally damaged, vulnerable girl and uses her insecurities to loop her further into the emotionally manipulative relationship, making her submissive and adoring of him because he's her so-called hero. She lives only to please him.

""Make up is just make up, skin is just skin, it is what it is."" The context being James says this after seeing Abbi's bruises beneath her make-up when it smudges in the rain ... I don't think I need to comment on that.

I can't say there really is an antagonist in this book, the closest would be Seth and the batshit crazy counselor. Seth is the abusive boyfriend who shoots up the school, and my God he couldn't have made this asshole anymore obvious that he's a bad guy. Just short of literally saying, ""I'm the bad guy."" Him shooting up the school was mostly inconsequential. James isn't even the one to stop him, it was the jock he'd fought earlier in the book. So he's not even active in his own story.

Oh yeah, James rollerskated into the shooting. Yep, you don't need to read it again, I said what I said. This whole book is so bonkers and out of touch that the whole experience felt like a fever dream. I was expecting Obama to show up and drop some actual philosophical wisdom about unresolved issues or some shit.

Davis. Fuck this character. Greg deflected criticism by saying Davis was based off of a real life friend of his who died. I really couldn't care less. If I were him I'd be haunting Greg's ass because this portrayal is character assassination. Davis is a childish, immature idiot whose sole purpose is to make James look smart and good despite the fact the boy's a shithead. He's supposed to be comic relief but he isn't fucking funny. He reveres his best friend, and he's just such a good buddy, you know? Either Greg doesn't know what a healthy friendship looks like, or he intentionally wrote Davis to be gay. No straight man says, ""'I wish you were my boyfriend!"" so out of the blue. This was not an established joke between them, this wasn't even really played off as a joke. Not to mention it's implied that he's annoyed about James and Abbi's relationship. Our man James is like, 'he's such a good friend.'

...

Pal, that guy wants to suck your dick.

I digress, he dies later in the novel in one of the most confusing and senseless deaths I've ever read about in fiction. He jumps out of the car in the middle of the motorway to try and stop a guy from committing suicide, in turn getting hit by a truck. I mean, I don't understand the thinking behind that. The way his death was talked about was so... clinical and cold. There was no emotion behind it. There was no lasting effect on Abbi or James. Nothing in this book has any consequence.

Because nothing in this book can be centered around anything else but James, even Davis' funeral features his mother getting up and talking about how great of a friend James was to Davis. It was so incredibly disrespectful. A mother would never get up to remember her son and then bang on about one of his mates. There's just no way.

However, the worst part of this book were the sex scenes. The teenage sex scenes that were written by a thirty-something year old man featuring two incredibly broken people who are attracted to each other because fuck you, trauma is hot, ok!?

Listen, I've read Sarah J. Maas, okay? I'm used to ridiculous sex scenes that make no sense and are laughable, but Stones to Abbigale made me genuinely uncomfortable. This chick can read out a round of the dirtiest cards in Cards Against Humanity with a straight face, and this book had me visibly repulsed.

There's a line that makes my skin wish to peel back from my bones, 'our bodies sliding together'...

I have been converted. I am now abstinent. I will cart myself off to a fucking nunnery because, my dude, this scarred me for fucking life.

And when he kissed her in the classroom? I lost my will to live.

I never want to experience a revulsion like that again, and so I will NOT be re-reading Stones to Abbigale in the near, or far future, thank you very fucking much.

Now how could he improve this mess?

The writing needs a fucking glow-up and fast. Take writing classes. Practice. Just don't fucking publish another book until you at least learn new speaker, new line.

Also, emotion. A big part of the problem was lazy descriptions and pitiless sentences, I don't even know what the characters look like so... fix it. Everything that should've been tragic lost its impact due to piss poor writing.

The plot is non-existent, and this story is so overdone there really is no saving it. Shift the focus elsewhere. It could be centered around Abbi's father's trial, which would make it far more interesting and unique, making it a story about James and Abbi bonding over this traumatic event and the upcoming court date.

You could draw parallels in the families by having Abbi's mum still be there, but complicit, much like James' mum. This could be a character arc where both mothers learn how to step up and take charge. Abbi's mother gets over her fear of her husband, and testifies against him. James' mother becomes less of a pushover, putting the foot down where her kids are concerned.

The school shooting could happen still, but add more conflict between James and Seth instead of there only being one showdown between the two. More arguments, more threats, make Davis relevant by him actually standing up for James and Abbi, even helping to take Seth down at the peak of the novel.

Drop the whole thing with Abbi being potentially responsible, as well as the guidance counselor, she was so fucking boring to read about.

Unless you're making Jason a friend or foe, drop the fights entirely, they do jackshit for the novel.

Include James actually being a friend to Davis, you know, making intelligent, witty jokes that build relationships and actually give the impression of genuine friendship?

The same with Abbi and James, drop the whole obsession thing, it was fucking creepy. I liked the letters thing, but it was wasted potential, it was used for exposition, which was lazy story telling. I'll use the example of Feyre and Rhys from ACOTAR, in the second book they use notes for flirting, which builds character and depth to their relationship, thus creating emotional investment from the reader and a more likeable dynamic that the reader can support because it was funny and cute to watch these two characters fall in love. There's a severe lack of chemistry between Abbi and James that even a lab can't fix this relationship.

Therefore, get rid of the manipulation. After the school shooting, let it be enough that James and Abbi seek out proper help. Abbi shouldn't be used to inflate and fulfill a saviour fantasy. Remember children, You don't love them if you don't look out for them; that means telling them to get help when necessary, not playing happy families and ignoring the problem.

Overall, this book was shit and I would never recommend. I was in the middle of exam week, and I managed to read Siege and Storm and Ruin and Rising by Leigh Bardugo before I finished this novel. I disliked both books strongly. Despite being so short, it was a slug to get through because I physically couldn't force myself to read this."
Stones To Abbigale,Samantha Reid,"February 23, 2017",1.0,"To start it off and simply; this book is trash. There is absolutely nothing good about this book. Like, at all. If I could rate it any lower, then I would.
The characters have 0 personality for starters, except for the protagonist James, who is judgemental, narcissistic and obsessive. He manipulates the girl he loves, Abbi, and takes advantage of her weakened emotional state. For Pete's sake, he sent her a love letter that tell her that only HE can heal her scars. Keep in mind, James sends Abbi this letter a mere 2 days after he talks to her for the first time. 2 DAYS! Not to mention, Abbi had just gotten out of an abusive relationship.
Of course, this book is riddled with numerous grammar and spelling errors. You can tell that the author hadn't picked up a book in 14 years. A 30 year old man does not know how to use a comma. They teach basic grammar in elementary school! An eighth grader knows how to use grammar better than this 'author'. I use the term author very generously.
THE PLOT IS ALSO TRASH. The problems are introduced in the beginning of the chapter and then immediately solved by either the end of the chapter or the beginning of the next. The plot is just so contrived.
There's nothing salvageable about this book. In order for it to be at least a decent novel, it would have to be entirely reworked. It's over filled will crappy metaphors and reads more like a bad fanfiction rather than an actual published book. It's so obvious that this book was self published because no publishing company in their right mind would publish this tripe."
Stones To Abbigale,Mary,"December 6, 2015",1.0,"I ""read"" this in the sense that I listened to someone read through it... Oh lord. I'm going to try to talk about my interpretation of this book without being offensive. I'm also going to go ahead and say that this review will be rife with spoilers.

SPOILERS BELOW. MANY OF THEM.

SERIOUSLY. LOTS OF SPOILERS.

TURN BACK NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED.

What stood out to me the most is that the emotions the main character experiences, specifically in response to traumatic events, are not accurate to what most people would experience under those circumstances. Someone who steps in their fellow students' blood would not feel absolutely nothing about going back to the school where those students were killed, nor would they feel as though everything was okay because there were some students who hadn't lost someone close to them. Someone who sees their friend get hit by a car would not immediately descend into an existential spiral of self-hatred. They might feel some degree of survivor's guilt, sure, but for him to watch his friend die and IMMEDIATELY think that if they hadn't been friends, the friend would still be alive... no.

Everyone responds to traumatic events in different ways, but a school shooting that kills FIFTY-TWO PEOPLE leaves nobody at that school untouched. James' distaste for the general student body doesn't make him an exception to this. His life is put in immediate danger by virtue of being present on the campus during an active shooter situation. His life is put in even more immediate danger when he confronts the killer face-to-face. That kind of thing leaves marks. He might have nightmares about Seth in his bloodied trenchcoat pointing a gun at him, or about having been too late to save Abbi, or about the students he stepped over calling to him for help. He might become clingy or desperately afraid for Abbi's safety. He might have a flashback or a panic attack upon walking through the halls again once the school reopened. He would almost definitely require grief counseling, and the narrative could discuss his struggles with that. None of this happens, though. The shooting happens, everyone is sad and spouts empty ""encouraging"" rhetoric for a day or two, and then they carry on as normal.

And then the loss of his supposed best friend reads like... well, not like that at all. Onision skips any immediate reactions that James could have, such as desperation to get help for Davis or denial about the fact that his best friend has just been fatally wounded, and goes straight for a chain of thoughts that would be more appropriate for someone who has already recovered from the immediate shock of the event. It's very jarring and strange, and it comes across as Onision either not knowing how to write grief or never having experienced grief firsthand. Grief is deeper than sadness, and it's deeper than the angsty, self-pitying string of thoughts that go through James' mind. Again, I understand that not everyone is going to have my exact experiences with grief or traumatic events, and I don't expect them to. What I do expect, though, is for a character who is clearly supposed to be relatable to actually BE RELATABLE.

Here's where I'm edging into potentially offensive territory, and I apologize in advance: I could understand a little bit better if this was an exploration into the mind of a person with some kind of psychological or emotional disorder. If it were discussed in the story, if the main character had been canonically diagnosed with some kind of condition and the narrative was about him going through his life and coping with that condition, I could understand why the reactions to various events were something I would consider unusual or out of touch. I don't have a psychological condition that prevents me from feeling empathy or interferes with the ways I experience grief, so again, I am very sorry if I'm completely out of line here, and I'll be happy to be told so. I also just want to say that I don't believe that this narrative is a definitive guide to (or an even remotely accurate depiction of) emotional disorders. Not in the slightest. I think if this was something that Onision was trying to pull off (and I'm almost certain it wasn't something that even crossed his mind), he did it incredibly, incredibly poorly, and he did it in a way that discourages rather than encourages sympathy and understanding. This is just an alternate way of writing James' story that I believe could be of actual literary merit if done well -- which it wouldn't have been if Onision had done it, given what he seems to think of mentally ill people.

If you're going to experience this book, I recommend that you listen to people reading this book rather than read it yourself. The commentary is almost bound to be golden."

Stones To Abbigale,Pickles,"November 24, 2020",1.0,no ♥️
Stones To Abbigale,Shawn,"May 5, 2019",1.0,"I would like to say beforehand that I had come across this book by my cousin, who very much likes this book and recommended it to me. Just a PSA, you should never listen to an eleven-year-old who watches Singaporean dramas daily. I learned that lesson the hard way.

First of all, the author, Onision, is a YouTuber. I should have seen the red flags the second I found out about this. I was in the midst of this book when I did. So after I finished, I did some researching. Apparently, when writing this book, he refused any professional help and genuinely believed he could self publish a book all by himself. He is not a good writer. The sentences are boring. The entire novel is just the same thing. Again and again and again. There is even an entire repeated paragraph; editing is non-existent. The grammar is appalling. There is no description of anything. Hell, I didn’t even know how old they were until I was halfway through the book.

I have an English exam in two days and I’m scared that I might fail. I have indubitably become dumber after reading this book.

And it’s so unrealistic like I can’t.

There are just too many cliches in this story. It is practically a Wattpad book. James, the protagonist, is unhealthily obsessed with Abbigale and believes that no one in the world can understand them but each other. That is the only thing that is given to us readers to understand. Other than that, there is no character development nor depth. Also, Physical contact seems to be of a rarity in the world that this book is portrayed in; a hug out of nowhere? Arm brushes against arm? James is so into it it is disgusting. It’s like they are nine… EXCEPT THEY ARE SEVENTEEN.

First, we must discuss the matter that is James. The main character is a narcissistic ass. I am informed that the author of this book has created the protagonist to be like him — going through the same things and claiming that the book isn’t necessarily 'fiction'. He says its 'part fiction'. The blurb even says he’s experienced this before and everything (the author). I’m so terrified if this is actually how the author experiences the world or if he is dramatizing it.

I think that the author has a really large ego. All the characters in this book just seem to love James. They constantly praise him even though there is nothing to praise about. There even is an entire character just to compliment James. The character — named Davis — is like a groupie to him. It’s so, so, weird. There is a line in the book that goes something like 'James I love you and I wish you were my boyfriend!'

No. Just, no.

Then there is Abbigale. Abbigale is this goth girl with an alcoholic father and an abusive ex-boyfriend. Now, where have we heard that from? She has a dark history and starts to form a relationship with James. When the plot is non-existent, The book is just James and Abbigale together. James is a manipulative and horrible person and takes advantage of Abbigale’s vulnerable state (which is the entire book). She’s nothing but the damsel in distress and all James does is use it to his own gain and narrative. It makes me want to puke.

'Omg James you’re so quirky.'
'I'm going to marry you someday so might as well call you HUBBY.'
'Aww, you wrote me a disgusting love letter telling me my suffering is obsolete and implausible? I think I’m in love with you.'

I cannot I cannot.

Then the plot starts to come in…. The mother of the protagonist has fallen in love with a random high-flyer that lives in the mountains and wants to move in together! James and Abbigale can’t be together! What a sophisticated plot! Oh no! But to top all that off, right as James arrives at school that very morning, there is a school shooting.

Abbigale’s abusive ex apparently had gone off the rails and decided to shoot up the school.

(James ran around the school barefoot and stepped on glass because he had rollerblades on and took them off…. DO NOT GET ME STARTED — HE JUST DECIDED THAT A SCHOOL SHOOTING WAS THE PERFECT OCCASION FOR ROLLERBLADES).

And then President of the United States comes to visit them and declare James as a hero. And then Abbigale’s father gets arrested by the police after smashing a bottle over James’ head. And then Davis gets hit on the freeway. And then during his funeral, his mother declares James a hero (again) for getting his body. And then the guidance counsellor blames Abbigale for inspiring the school shooting. And then the guidance counsellor burns down the school.

Do you see where I’m going with this?

I absolutely despise this plot. Not only does the storyline come out of nowhere, but they come at you and punch you in the face.

This book, even worse, glorifies trauma victims and school shootings. I’m pretty sure the author has some fetish with these things. The way that school shootings are portrayed in this book is outrageous. It just serves as a way for James to be a hero and rescue Abbigale and allow them to bond through the trauma of it. It romanticizes the horrid act and honestly makes me so mad. Furthermore, the book just creates a new stereotype altogether about how abuse victims are so ‘captivating to the human eye to manipulate’. It’s. So. Bad. I cannot FATHOM it. After the school shooting, Abbigale stays at James’ place because her father isn’t answering any of her calls. So, basically, the entire school shooting, in which 50 people died in, was only written into the book so these two characters that I don't care about can end up in a bed together.

In conclusion, this book was so trash that just giving it a one-star review wasn't enough. Long story short, it's the book version of 'The Room' by Tommy Wiseau."
Stones To Abbigale,Cat,"April 12, 2021",4.0,"Edit 2021: I read this book as a dumbass teen back in 2015 when I was going through an 'edgy' phase and fancied myself to be far smarter than I actually was. I don't remember what the plot was at all anymore. There is zero reason for me to touch this book ever again to update this hot mess of a 'review,' especially considering who the author is. I'd delete this if I knew how. You can stop wasting your time leaving shitty comments now.

Unlike many of the reviewers here, I'm rating this book based on my opinion of the author as a person. I'm rating the book based on the book itself.

When I first picked up this book, I had little idea of what to expect besides grammar errors, of which there were a significant amount. It is my understanding that the author preferred to leave most of them as is for whatever reason he chose, and even though I'm a bit of a grammar-nazi, I didn't mind them very much. How could I mind them when I became so absorbed in the story itself? Much of the language was borderline elegant, and the plot, while feeling a tad dramatic and rushed, was quite gripping. It's a short read that didn't take much of my time, but it was one of the better books I've read in a long while.

My fifty-year-old mother, an avid reader who reads as much as she can in her spare time, also read the book. She knew nothing of Onision except for what I told her after she'd finished reading. With her opinion completely unclouded by an opinion on the author, she said that although there were grammar errors, she loved it, and wondered if there were any more by the same author that she could read.

Hats off to you, Onision, for successfully writing an intriguing story that kept my short attention span for the entire time I read it."
Stones To Abbigale,Jimmy Von,"June 27, 2015",1.0,"honestly, i went in thinking this could've been good, but close to half way through, its cringeworthy self indulgence. This story is based on the author's life. Onision crafts a world of loathing and self pity and lives in it through james, our angsty protagonist. James has fallen for Abbigale, a girl in his class, and spends the novel trying to pander to her. My primary criticism is how unreadable this feels. The pages just drag on and on concerning useless details and pretentious word choice. (i'd also like to add the book is full of typos and mistakes like not making a new paragraph for speakers in a dialogue. but that's more of a nitpicky thing) There is little redeemable about any character as they're all just plain awful. I've never read a book that is a trifecta of bad characters, bad writing, and Self indulgence. Its like ""The Room"" but in book form. Avoid at all costs."
Stones To Abbigale,Haley Hughes,"August 5, 2016",1.0,"On Amazon, Onision writes that he hasn't read a book in 14 years. I have to say, it seriously shows. Greg knows nothing about how to develop characters (none of the characters are physically described, for example) or even basic sentence structure. His biggest problem is writing dialogue, which is constantly wrong. Listen Greg, please. You put the punctuation INSIDE the quotation marks. Ex. ""Like this,"" NOT ""Like this"","
Stones To Abbigale,Cerys,"February 1, 2016",1.0,"This book is the epitome of the word awful. Considering how short it is, it's quite astounding how it manages to be problematic in almost every way.

The narrator, James, is a self-obsessed, sanctimonious misogynist who is essentially a predator. The fact the narrator is supposed to be ""a better version"" of the author says a lot about Onision/Greg. Every other character in the book is empty. Abbigale is flat and emotionless, which just makes his obsession with her seem even creepier, plus the narrator's supposed best friend serves only as an ego boost to James.

To make it worse, it is also one of the most poorly constructed novels I've ever read. The grammar is an absolute mess for a start - missing words, added words, made up words, misuse of punctuation, pretty much every mistake which could be made can be found somewhere in Stones to Abbigale.

There is literally no plot. It is a stream of random events smashed together with no purpose other than to further the misery of James and Abbigale. This entire book is essentially one massive, and poorly written, pity party.

Don't waste your money or your time."

Stones To Abbigale,Bryn,"November 10, 2021",1.0,"Huh. Well. This was a nightmare. Maybe it's because I forced myself to read most of this in one sitting, or maybe it's because I'm tired, or maybe it's because every little aspect of this book was made to piss me off specifically, I really, really did not like this.

So, before the actual review, some explanation on the author: he's kind of a garbage person. I am absolutely not going to feel bad about tearing apart his book. Short version, this dude 1) is a YouTube personality that has used his fame to manipulate multiple women, 2) has repeatedly and excessively harassed other YouTube personalities, and 3) asked his followers, many of whom are underage girls, to send him photos so he can ""rate"" them, and proceeded to judge underage girls' appearances on his channel in photos where many were not fully clothed. So yeah, pretty bad.

But let's move onto the book, shall we?

This book was trash. Now, the author admitted to not having read a book in many years, and also did not have an official editor. Any author that has any sort of skill knows that you have to read, or at the very least practice writing a lot. It is clear that the author has not done this.

The writing is by far the most egregious aspect (well, maybe second most) of the entire book. It is very clear that the author has not looked in the general direction of a book in his life. There are grammar mistakes on every page. Dialogue is not broken up into different paragraphs. Ampersands and ""etc"" are used in both narration and dialogue. I don't think a single comma was placed correctly. The style is horrendous and there is no emotion in any part of the book. So, yeah, bad.

The plot was also offensively bad. There was no direction anywhere. Events just kind of happened. Scenes went from one to the next with no significance to anything. There were maybe three to four major plot events, but even then they were done in a chapter or two. The ending was rushed and the development was meaningless. There was no clear antagonist or any clear protagonist motivation. Nothing really happened. It's just awful event after awful event and no meaning to any of it.

The characters were... oooooh man. Now, the relationship was the main aspect of the book, but it was so incredibly badly written that it's hard to see it as the base of the whole thing. It's extremely rushed and undeveloped. Every interaction seems forced. The love interest confesses her deepest, darkest secrets to the protagonist in like their third conversation ever. Their relationship doesn't really change or progress throughout the book either, there's no highs or lows, it just stays static.

The characters themselves were also very bad. The main character, James, has virtually no personality aside from being a narrator. His personality changes drastically between scenes. He's also overpowered, which is hard to do in a contemporary book, but he beats four tough kids in a fight even though he is physically weaker and has no training. Despite this, the entire book revolves around him. The love interest, Abbi, is reduced to exactly that, no regard given to her actual status as a character. She has one (1) character trait, and it's that she's sad and traumatized. The villains, if they can be called that, are cardboard and cheap. The main side character, Davis, is... something. The way he's talked about makes it seem like the other characters barely tolerate him, though he's made out to be James's best friend. He's sidelined and ignored until it's his time to shine to bring Angst to the plot.

Now, to address the elephant in the room. This book has two elements in it which it addresses awfully: school shootings and rape.

There is a school shooting that happens around thirty percent through the book. The way it is portrayed is absolutely terrible and revolting to read, and not in the way it's supposed to be. The shooter is in all of two scenes before the incident itself happens. There is no buildup and no respect. The main character rollerblades (yes. Rollerblades) into the school to save his girlfriend. It turns out later that it's the deadliest school shooting in all of American history. It is framed in the least respectful way possible. It's used as a plot device in order to get Abbi and James closer, and for James to be praised by the narrative for absolutely no reason.

The second bad thing this book does is the way it depicts a sexual assault and the aftermath. Abbi was violently raped in her past and it causes her trauma throughout the book. However, this isn't a thing for her, it's for James. It's only there to make Abbi a tortured, broken soul for James to help heal. The way it is portrayed is completely offensive and trivializes a serious topic. This very personal and very traumatic event isn't put in the book so that we can see its effect on her character and see her grow and move past it and strengthen herself, it's used as a stepping stone for a romance.

Both of these are extremely serious topics, and if portrayed correctly with forethought and respect, they would be meaningful and well done. But this book has neither forethought nor respect. It disregards the real people that are victims of these things and boils their experiences down to being a sad thing that spurs on a romance. It's .

So. This book is bad. Not really much else to say."

Stones To Abbigale,Kirk,"February 21, 2020",3.0,"Three stars.

I know, right?

But hear me out.

Was this book bad?

Yes.

Was it so bad it was good?

Fuck yeah, man! This is a glorious train wreck, one of the most glorious I have seen in a long time. And I will be reading more of this guy’s shit in the future.

So what was bad/good about it?

The dialog lacks a lot of description, so it feels like almost everything is delivered deadpan. I want to say it reminds me of a Wes Anderson film, but his films are charmingly awkward. The interactions between folks in this book are just awkward. It is almost like the dialog was taken from a series of private messages, quote marks were put around it, and it was tossed in the books.

There were times where it felt like chunks of the dialog were missing entirely too. At one point the protagonist asks Abbi why her dad didn’t get a hamster for her. She replies, “hopefully you can find something that will work for that.” Then he is crushed.

What?

What just happened?

Next up: the characters.

They are all there to fawn over the protagonist. The extent of their depth is maybe a quirk for each of them. There’s damaged girl. Best friend who worships protagonist. Mean jock who begrudgingly respects protagonist. Teachers who range from pricky to also worshipping the protagonist . . .

The story itself jumps a bit as well. It is a love story. Then it is a school shooting story (the entire school shooting in novels has become a cliche trope at this point). Then it just kind of levels out and is peppered with drama to keep people going.

But you know what? I never felt bored reading this. I never once thought about giving up and putting it down for good. I couldn’t wait to see what would come next. Would it be the awkward friend going “beep boop beep boop pee poop,” and everyone around him just LOVING the humor that no reader could ever comprehend? Will it be another awkward interaction between the protagonist and Abbi where they declare their superficial love for one another or repeat cliches to one another? Will some shit literally explode everywhere? Will the plot unravel further?

Man, this shit was a wild ride. If the Trump presidency was a book, this would be the fucking book right here. But you know what? This book won’t grab you by the pussy. This book won’t threaten to undermine democracy and fill government with corporate plants. This books is all the disaster that is current American politics, without any of the stakes. And that, my friends, is pretty fucking spectacular."
Stones To Abbigale,Miss Mara,"December 16, 2018",1.0,"I tried. I tried to keep an open mind and think, “hey, even though the author is a terrible person, the book might be good!” Boy, did that not work.

What I noticed straight away was that the grammar was atrocious. Absolutely horrific. Comma splice errors, run on sentences, complete words missing from a sentence (I had to decipher the meaning with words omitted - eg: “The next school day I walked hand in hand with into the school building...”).

Other than terrible grammar, which could have been easily fixed if Greg bothered to read over his writing even once or, god forbid, hire an editor, there’s other big issues with the book as well. Firstly, James is very obviously a self-insert character. And he’s portrayed just like any other self insert character - exactly how the author wants himself to be like. James is apparently so much different from the rest of humanity and spends his days psychoanalyzing them. Alright. Did I forget to mention that James is apparently really amazing at reading other people’s characters and

Besides the shitty self insert, the other characters were bland as fuck as well. Abbigale is Greg’s version of a Mary Sue (i.e. messed up through trauma) and Jason is that bully jock stereotype that somehow still exists in 21st century literature? If you can call this dumpster fire literature, that is. Oh, and let’s not forget Davis. Oh Davis! How you worship at Gr- er, I mean James’s feet! You think he’s the most perfect person on earth! Because that is totally realistic!

Besides the characters being horribly developed, the plot and events happening in the story are just... so unbelievable. I cannot comprehend how these events occurred to the same people in the same school over this period of time.

Overall, this book was absolute garbage, and I would give it zero stars if I could."
Stones To Abbigale,Ella Adams,"December 5, 2018",1.0,"this is perhaps the worst book i’ve ever read. the grammar is poor, all of the characters speak the same, and james is such a terrible protagonist. there is no reason to root for him. his girlfriend has zero personality and is essentially just a tragic backstory. the way she reacts to the abuse is completely ridiculous and unrealistic. as for davis, he’s essentially just there to worship james. this character is so unbelievably cringy. additionally all of the adults in the story are the most idiotic, unrealistic, unprofessional i’ve ever had the displeasure to read about. i regret ever laying my eyes on this book and i implore you to stay far far far away."
Stones To Abbigale,Milla J,"February 17, 2019",1.0,"It was a shitty book by a piece of shit human. I decided to count how many adverbs the story had. Fucking 971, although I might have missed some. The grammar was also atrocious. I don't want to rip apart the story too much since Strange Aeons did that already (watch her video on the book: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xcws...)

Here are some of the weirdest sentences in the book (I copied them straight out the text with NO changes to the grammar):

'He rapidly stepped towards her.'
'I smiled and replied ""Makeup is just makeup, skin is just skin. It is what it is.""'

'I want to hear everything you have to say. I want to find a way to heal the damage done until you can forget it ever existed.'
I find that problematic. Getting into a romantic relationship is not going to heal up traumatic experiences and take away mental illness. I hate everything about that aspect of the book. If you feel like you're all alone with your problems, get professional help. Sure, the love and support of your family and friends is important, but it's not a substitute for seeking treatment.

'My mom inquired, ""So how's your life going James?"" I replied ""Fine."" Rick asked, ""Got a girlfriend?"" I didn't respond.'
This grammar and dialogue make me want to cry.

'She had become the center of my world and I felt like I was finally really finally enjoying my life.'
I can't say I'm too surprised to see all these grammar mistakes since the book was self-published.
Also, if a relationship is the only thing that makes you feel good about yourself, seek professional help. It is not healthy for your life to revolve solely around another person.

'Everyone silently sat at the table awkwardly pushing around their food as I gathered my things.'
'Davis could see my upset posture out his window as the bus pulled up so I walked up the steps this time he screamed, ""I love you so much! I wished you were my boyfriend!""'
'She giggled excitedly and immediately jumped on me while simultaneously wrapping her legs around me happilly kissing every part of my face but my lips.'

'The president walked over to Chris, pulling his own pants slightly back so he could crouch.'
'Naturally Abbi was on my team and we played against a couple of people who were equally unenthusiastic about the sport so we basically just stood around talking about how dorky our uniforms were and basically anything we could keep our minds preoccupied.'

'It also made me feel good about myself, as my mom and Abbi would compliment how strong they thought I was every time I walked out with something heavy.'
(Context: they were making out in their bed)'I firmly grabbed her waist and slid my hips slowly up her now soaking legs.' WHY WERE HER LEGS SOAKING??

All in all, I hate how this book romanticised abuse and mental illness as cute. It also used school shootings and abusive parents as drama bonding. The book felt like the first draft of a one direction saviour fantasy fanfiction.

(No offence to anyone who genuinely liked it)"
Stones To Abbigale,Jordan Barclay,"January 17, 2019",2.0,"Oh... Onion boy...

I did an audiobook of this for the clout. Here's the link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzySp...

Now onto the review.

Dear Onion man,
I'm sure you've gotten countless negative reviews about the sh*thead person you are (rating underage girls, manipulating relationships, mocking self-harm victims, etc. (and trust me there's a lot of etc.)) but from here on out, I will remove this personal bias from my review and pertain solely to the text.

Yeah man your book is toxic.
Somewhat well-written, with 'decent' development in the plot, but good lord, the thematic implications are dangerous to promote.

SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT (you won't miss much I promise)

Your protagonist, James (aka the ""idyllic-anime-version"" of yourself), finds joy in 'fixing' this broken girl by assaulting the jocks and kissing her self-harm scars. You glamorize these events.
Stop it.

The school-shooting that you portrayed seemed like it could be coming from a heartfelt standpoint to address a real social problem, but all of that is stripped away when you exaggerate the hell out of it, causing the scene to be triggering to real victims of shootings and unbelievable to other readers. So please don't make Seth, the school shooter, parallel to some cartoon villain.

Finally, your depiction of Abbi's father couldn't be more one-dimensional, which is harmful to deliver to a younger audience that goes through more complex cases of domestic violence. Abbi's father got 2-3 pages of presence in the book's entire plot, yet he's the catalyst for nearly all of her psychological torment. so please, stop this.

Love,
JB

There's a lot more shit about this book, but I'm done talking here. If you want to hurt yourself by listening to my audiobook, go for it. I encourage nobody to give this individual your money (or even time).

I wish I never picked this book up myself. I was simply curious, but now I'm very aware that this deranged author has no idea how humans interact. Please people don't read this, the book will waste some very valuable time you can spend volunteering in soup kitchens, caring for the elderly, and /or cuddling aids babies in their last moments on this planet. This book adds absolutely nothing of value to your life or to society. I've never had a reaction such as this to a book. Absolute garbage."
Stones To Abbigale,Emma L.B.,"December 7, 2019",1.0,"Ah yes, ""Stones to Abbigale"", AKA ""Onisions wet dream about a girl so broken down that he can save her in every possible way and hyperfocus on her in a NOT CREEPY way AT ALL since he just 'cares' about her 'so much' ""...



This book was awful. Not only was the main character uninteresting and boring, but no character had any depth more than it could take a single word to describe them. ""Good"", ""crazy"", ""broken"", ""dorky"", ""angry"", ""stuck up"" etc, I rather have a book with colourful and interesting characters than a book with boring grey goo, yes, but I also like them to have SOME depth, or at least being believable. No one in this book felt believable.

The fact that Gurg wrote this saying that it's not all non-fiction makes me really scared. The way the main character hyperfocuses on Abbi even from start is unnerving, but what's even more creepy is that she actually ""likes it"" and that his creepy behavior never is questioned or seen as problematic. A guy creeping on you, staring at you, longing for you and writing too personal things to you too quickly isn't creepy at all. Naah. It's just ""charming"", because James just SO dorky. Even when she confronts him about him being too much it's completely pointless, because it only leads to them being even closer than before. Abbi has no life of her own, because as soon as James comes into it, he's there for her, every second. She tells him everything, he is her rock, her support. He trusts her and she trusts him in return. She is never mean, she is never on her own. He knows EXACTLY how she feels and thinks, as he states many times in the book (""I knew this meant everything to her"", etc). As soon as they have a relationship they're always together, because ""that's what they both want"". Thinking of Gurg and his relationship to his previous girlfriends in real life makes this so much worse. James really is written as a controlling boyfriend from the eyes of the controlling one, not having the slightest idea of them being controlling at all, and Abbi is the perfect victim, the perfect girl who just goes along and loves him, and takes every right step in the right time, never questioning him and always relying on him. It gives me bad goosebumps, really, really bad.



This book was BORING. There are maybe three big events totally and they're all pointless and boring. (Spoiler alert, I guess, but trust me, the ""spoilers"" aren't worth it). There's James' journey to getting close to Abbi, then there's a school shooting, then there's a death of James' best friend (who I hated with all my heart throughout the book) and then the school is burned down. All of this sounds interesting but somehow, NONE of it really is interesting. Maybe because despite it all, none of it impact out main character. He SAYS he's sad when his best friend dies, but a chapter after the funeral it's like it never happened. By the time the school is burnt down, his best friend isn't even mentioned again. It all feels like the book was a mishmash of stuff that Gurg has been a victim of himself (or wish he was a victim of) but ""despite it all came out stronger and tougher than before"". Which make me once again believe that this book is a wet dream of Onisions, in which he is the calm, collected, strong and sympathetic one while everyone else is dumb, weak and too emotional.

Davis was a character, I think. He only screamed ""LoL RAndEM XD""-stuff now and again and wasn't funny at all, yet our main character almost pissed himself with laughter every time. It felt really out of character for James to be so calm, collected and ""cool"" otherwise, just to broke completely as soon as Davis behaved like a freak. It's almost like Davis is the person Gurg wanted to be when he was a late teenager, and James' reaction is how he wished everyone would react to him. I'm not saying this is true, of course, but that was the first thing I was thinking when Davis started being ""funny"" and the thought stayed with me the whole book through.

Might I also add that NO ONE BEHAVED LIKE A REAL PERSON. Who in their right mind starts talking about another person at their own child's funeral? ""Yes my child is dead and it's sad, but he really loved this other person, he always said he was handsome, oh my how he loved him, you should've heard him-"". I was also very angry that the teacher (whose name I forgot since I never bothered remember it) started of as a somewhat interesting character with a hidden grudge for Abbi, only to then QUICKLY turn into a pro-life psychopath who burned down the school. Nice move, Gurg, you ruined the one single character I actually was interested in this whole time.

I have more to say, but I wont, because this book gives me a really bad taste in my mouth and I regret that I listened to it. I did NOT pay for this book, as no one should, but instead listened to it via . Thanks Jordan.

Now here's to never read this piece of shit ever again (unless to laugh hysterically at how bad it is). Cheers!"

Apart from being unintentionally hilarious, as far as we know at least, there were sections of this fever dream of a godawful attempt at fiction by a self absorbed, deluded, narcissistic emo, more often than not with poor grammar, that reminded me in its moments of sudden outbursts of violence and death as well as psychosexual passion of Story of the Eye by Georges Bataille and Crash by J. G. Ballard. Difference is the latter two are good."
Stones To Abbigale,Melissa De Cunto,"March 20, 2020",2.0,This book made me laugh and cry. The love between James and Abbigale and his friendship with Davis was the parts where I go aww. The things that happen at the school and happen to a character who which I would not say so I won’t spoil you but those parts were the crying happen. Before I read this book I thought it was going to a bad book. Due to fact what people said on YouTube and Goodreads but I decided to give this book an open mind and I am glad I did. I feel like people don’t like this book due to the fact the YouTuber who wrote this; Onision is a hated youtuber who I have watch in the past (but has since stop for years now.)This is why I think it was rated low. Also I feel people rated low is that it was not for them aka the book target audience. For me who doesn’t watch his videos anymore most likely would read his other books tomorrow and hope I like them to. Lastly for people who say the grammar in this book made the book unreadable I am really bad at grammar and spelling so it didn’t really bother me and most of the time did not notice.
Stones To Abbigale,Jenn,"April 12, 2015",4.0,"1. Clearly this is Onisions first book, as many have remarked, it's painfully obvious.
2. Onision needs an editor, I volunteer as tribute!
3. Despite the immaturity of his work and the need for editing I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Yes it's hokey and far too many bad things happen to one set of people and one school but that's easily overlooked by the heart of the story. I spent much of the book laughing, Onisions humor is as juvenile as one would expect. I was completely absorbed and immersed in the little world he created. And then, that asshole made my eyes leak worse than if someone has been cutting onions right under my nose.
4. This is a fast read, I highly recommend it if you are looking for something quick and light to drown in for a few hours, keeping in mind it is his first work and therefor not brilliant or perfect, but exactly what is needed on a rainy day in Washington."

Here are my thoughts.

Onision-I mean ""James""-wants to be the most powerful man on earth, with him always being the saving grace in every character's life. James thinks he is the reason for Abbi's happiness, the reason why the school was saved, the reason why Davis was happy...Onision-I mean James- thinks he is SO important in other's lives that even at Davis' funeral, his grieving mother's speech concluded with her calling James the reason why her son was happy. I mean??? James also was called a hero by the fictional president of the United States. Yep.

We all know that Onision loves being the white knight for suffering women...and he loves to watch women suffer. Here is what Abbi is dealing with:
1 Drunk, neglectful, abusive father
2 Absent mother
3 Gang r***
4 Pregnancy due to gang r***
5 Being beaten by her boyfriend Seth in the stomach, resulting in her losing the baby
6 Being a former c*****
7 Jason harassing her
8 Seth shooting up the school
9 A teacher who is set on ruining her life
10 Bullying

I mean, people have tough lives and go through horrible shit but this is excessive. It's almost like Onision is turned on by women in pain. You know who saved the damaged girl? The character James who Onision calls his ""better self"". In real life, Onion Man has said the majority of his female partners were damaged and he saved them. Yeah, right. Multiple girls have come out saying he allegedly abused them and he has said it's impossible due to all of the ""amazing shit"" he has done for them. The character of James is painted as a hero for being the center of Abbi's happiness.

Let's talk about Davis. Davis is the happy go lucky admirer and best friend of James. Davis dies when he tries to revive a suicide victim. Davis is run over by a truck. James is painted as a hero for pulling Davis' body off the road.

On the topic of the shooting, James didn't save the school. Jason did. James just inconvenienced Seth by damaging his weapon even though he had extras. But no Jason is the competition for Abbi, so there's no way the book can call Jason a hero! James is praised by the school, media and the fucking POTUS for what he did. Yeah...

On the topic of the entire fucking school burning down, I think it was extremely unnecessary to destroy a school that was being rebuilt. Why does a traumatic event have to occur every time something good is happening for the students? And Mrs Robertson starting it and getting locked up? Seems like every enemy of James' is a monster and James is the angel who knew about them all along. Gross.

And last but not least...So James' mom leaves their house that she bought to move in with her boyfriend...why couldn't the boyfriend just move in? And why did his mom allow James to live alone with his GIRLFRIEND at age 17, paying rent for a second house to house teen lovers? What the fuck??

I was very negative so here is what I liked
1 Davis was funny and a good guy
2 I liked when James stood up for Abbi to Mrs Robertson. Stigmatizing troubled kids is something I dislike as well
3...That's it."
Stones To Abbigale,Raynah,"February 13, 2020",1.0,"This review has spoilers!!

This book was terrible. The writing was awful, the characters were awful, and the plot was awful. The plot was basically James getting together with Abbi. All he ever talked about was Abbi, her name is probably on almost every page. Any conflict that was brought up would be resolved as soon as it happened and the scenes switched at a constant quick rate. One paragraph would be about the characters in class and the next paragraph they would be in a different setting.

A lot of events or how the characters acted did not seem very believable (Jason randomly interrupting a class and insulting the teacher, James walking into Abbi's class and making out with her, the fight between James and the jocks).

James' best friend Davis, did not have a purpose other than kissing James' ass and dying. The only time he was mentioned was whenever James' would take the bus to and from school, where Davis would yell about how amazing James was. He was also in a few other scenes where he was either acting out of the ordinary (was not explained but I can assume he was depressed after the shooting and that's how he coped, and or jealous of Abbi). I felt his death had no purpose to the story. James are sad other Davis' death but that's it. His death didn't change James as a person or change his view of the word or anything like that.

James was an awful character. He was obsessed with Abbi both before and while dating her as if she was the only person in the world (not in a cute way). He would get into fights with characters only to not get suffer any consequences (other than the part where he got suspended for pushing someone and getting beat up). James also did not care for his sister at all. He called her boy hungry and thought of her as an annoyance he wasn't able to tune out. When he found out about his sister being upset over a boy she liked who has passed away, he said it was none of his business and never talked about her for the rest of the book. Even if they don't have that close of a relationship, he should have still tried to comfort her. He cares more about Abbi than his sister.

I think my favourite line would have to be ""I am ashamed and somewhat terrified by how little I seemed to care about most everyone else outside her."" This line shows that James is self aware of how he is behaving but he doesn't do anything to fix it. By the end of the novel, he was still the same character as he was at the beginning of the book. There was no character development at all.

This book is just as awful as Onision."
Stones To Abbigale,Theresa,"June 18, 2019",1.0,"There is SO MUCH packed into this book and every little bit of it is ridiculous. It's obviously just Greg's savior fantasies in book format. Every other character in this book serves to justify his existence and have no personality of their own. He glamorizes and romanticizes self harm, domestic violence, sexual assault, and just being ""broken"" in general. The whole plot (if you dare to call it that) is Greg- I mean- James saving Abbigale from herself and the big, bad world while everyone else in his life tells him what a gReAt GuY he is. It was a struggle to get all the way through this, but it was like watching a train wreck. I just couldn't look away."
Empress Theresa,Tom Knighton,"October 27, 2014",1.0,"I only read the free sample chapters on his website.

I'm still pretty sure I overpaid."
Empress Theresa,aimi,"August 21, 2019",5.0,"I'm giving this five stars, not for the content, but for the size of Norm's balls.

Fun drinking game, though, if you're a bit bored of having a working liver: shot every time you roll your eyes at this irritating, narcissistic turd of a protagonist. My favourite part is probably all the times our sweet Christian role model used the words ""drop dead"" when referring to people who hoped she might wave at them."
Empress Theresa,Neon Ninja,"February 1, 2020",1.0,"I'm happy this book exists, because watching Krimson Rogue destroy it on Youtube is a delight to behold. However, the book itself is nonsensical garbage, so you should avoid it at all costs, I can't think of a single redeeming feature of it :)"
Empress Theresa,Alisa,"October 29, 2014",1.0,"So the author sent me a message on The Reading Obsession (which, by the way, I don't post at anymore), with really bad grammar, asking me to read his book, which, he claimed was better than any classic I could find. There wasn't any offer of a free copy like authors usually offer, but I was still kind of interested in a book better than any classic ever, so I looked it up. It's five dollars on Amazon, and I don't usually pay more than three dollars, so of course I wasn't going to buy it. I read the sample, and I am actually surprised at how incredibly awful it was.

First off, I'd like to say that, while I do love perfect grammar and spelling, if it's a self-published book, I am a little more lenient. , however, has not one or two little mistakes, but possibly hundreds. The author does not have a decent grasp of the English language, and this ""novel"" definitely needs an editor. Possibly several.

Theresa wasn't just slightly overconfident, in the first few chapters, she had already passed into the territory of a narcissist, constantly talking about how perfect she is. She complains incessantly, about how everyone likes her and is watching her. The best way I can describe her is in a math formula:

Theresa = (Every Mary Sue element smashed together into some awful combination)^3957

That's how far I got into the sample-just the sample- before I had to stop and have a head to desk connection. Instead of actually reviewing this excuse of a book, here are some pictures that sum up my feelings:"
Empress Theresa,☆Dani☆,"May 28, 2015",1.0,"OK, I'll be honest about two things before I start this review. Firstly, I only read the sample chapters available on the author's website, and secondly, I only read it due to the author's bizarre behaviour.

There are soooo many things wrong with this book. Let's start with the first sentence. No, actually, that is a good place to start. First sentences are important. They're meant to draw you in. It's your first impression on a reader, and you need to start strong. This novel does not. I mean, you know it's a really bad sign when it begins with an author's note saying, 'This chapter sets up the story. The action will begin in Chapter four.' Why would it do this? Why not start with the action, and explain the backstory as you go along?

The actual first sentence is this: 'I’m Theresa, the only child of Edward and Elizabeth Sullivan, and I hope it’s not bragging to say I was cute as heck at age ten.' And? This doesn't pull me in. Theresa means nothing to me yet. Her parents don't mean anything. And since the story is about her when she is a young woman, it's irrelevant what she looked like aged ten. There's no sense of anything happening. It's just useless.

The only thing it's good for is demonstrating how unprofessional the rest of the novel will be. Nothing actually happens for twelve paragraphs, and the first bit of action we get is a fox walking towards Theresa. No. Start off slightly bigger than that. This book still hasn't actually dragged the reader in yet, because it's just Theresa rambling. There's a time and a place for that in a novel, and the opening really isn't it.

On top of that, four things managed to annoy me while reading her ramblings. Firstly, Scout from doesn't really deal with 'simple issues'. Her story is about an alleged rape and racism, neither of which really strike me as 'simple issues'. Secondly, the phrase 'typical American girl'. Thirdly, these sentences- ""I did things in places like Boston, New York City, the White House, London, the British Parliament, Israel, the Middle East, and North Korea. Everybody knows their political relationships to the United States."" Boston and New York don't have political relationships with the United States, they are the United States. The British Parliament is in London, so it's wasteful saying it twice. Similarly, Israel is in the Middle East. This paragraph was a mess. And fourthly, the little self-satisfied rant about 'troubled girls'. I can't bear judgemental people, so already, I'm hating Theresa, who is supposed to be so good and likeable.

And like I said, the story hasn't even started yet.

It really doesn't get much better than that. The story begins with a 'white ball' from a fox going into her stomach, which doesn't even make any sense, and then the temperature gets really hot so the fire department arrive. The language is childish, and not in a good way. There are ways of showing a child's perspective while still writing well. This just comes across as very difficult to read, and extremely choppy and boring. There is no flow within the story, there's all these random events, and then it goes 'two days later, X happened.' Rather than reading it, you just find yourself scanning it, which does not make for fun reading. There's no sense of how the characters feel, or any sort of attempt at creating atmosphere. I guess if I was going to describe it as a food, it would be paper. Bland, boring and difficult to eat.

Then we get to this section, which was easily the worst written dialogue I've ever read in a novel claiming to be serious. Spoilered to save space.






























Did anyone actually read that? No, because it's incredibly boring. I scanned it, which meant I was never quite lost in the words.

There are no 'saids' used in this section, which only works for so long. There are also only three descriptions of what the characters are doing. Other than that, it is just dialogue between two characters we don't know a huge pile about. No feeling, no emotion, nothing, just words. And it's not clever enough to rely on purely the words, it needs something more. Not to mention the fact that this is only half of that piece of dialogue, because even in the spoiler tag, it was just dragging on too long.

A stupid line in that bit of dialogue- Jan asks Theresa how big the 'white thing' is, and we are told she holds her hands out to indicate the size. But as we cannot actually see Theresa's hands, we as readers have no idea how big it is. I kind of feel like this should be obvious, as the author is not a two year old, but clearly it isn't.

Then we get to my personal favourite line- 'This was the most important interview since Moses came down the mountain'. Look, I get that it's supposed to be a religious book. But seriously, this seems a bit blasphemous to me, and I'm not religious at all. In fact, I blaspheme all the time, it's no bother to me, and yet even I can point out an issue in this bit. See, I'm fairly sure Jesus is supposed to have had some very important interviews in his time, but this book pretty much says that Theresa is more important than that. It's a bit dodgy for someone who claims to be as religious as the author, in my opinion. But like I said, I'm not religious, so who knows?

I'm not reviewing anymore of the book, though I have read more. I'm not arsed, because it is complete and utter shite. Even the cover is dire. I'm not going to even mention the quality of the picture, my biggest issue is the fact that the author mentions she is wearing her army clothes in it. And then says don't worry, she's only in the army for a chapter or two, so it doesn't really represent the novel. So why the fecking hell would you choose this as your cover??? You chose your own cover, why choose something that doesn't represent your book???

It's almost a pity this book is so bad, because the author had big dreams for it. He even has a study guide on his website, and mentions on comments to bad Amazon reviews that his novel is going to be a bestseller and a classic, studied in schools around America. No, it's not. It hasn't even got good grammar. He claims that the reason people don't like this book is because they're unintelligent or atheist, and that they're afraid of him. It's bizarre, to be honest.

If he had a bit of a smaller ego, then maybe he could have taken on board criticism, worked even harder, and had a novel worth reading by the end. But his obsessive and delusional belief that his novel is the greatest thing on earth is ruining him. An author should always think their book is just a little bit crap. It's what makes them work even harder, creating something even better. But since Norman Boutin is already convinced he's perfect, he will never get any better. It's a shame, cause he really needs to."

Empress Theresa,Chris Purdy,"March 7, 2019",2.0,"We all know this book as a meme. We all know the author as a meme. If you're like me, you are considering buying this book and reading it ironically. I'm here to give a balanced review of the book as a stand-alone artifact, removed from the bullshit politics surrounding it, so you can set your expectations appropriately as a reader.

=======================

A lot of the other reviews are viewing this book in the lens of literary criticism. To that I respond: there are multiple lenses through which you can consume a story. After reading a few pages it becomes very obvious that this book holds no real value as serious literature. The main character is a level 255 Mary Sue. There are no consistent themes (besides hamfisted religious subtext which serves only to reinforce the ""Sueness"" of the main character). The narrative itself isn't compelling on any deep level.

And yet, I can forgive all of this if the book is otherwise entertaining.

The problem is that it's boring as hell. At over 450 pages, this is is a serious problem. Below I will describe the major contributing factors that lead me to this verdict and how a similar kind of premise could be better (as schlock).

=======================

""Empress Theresa"" is a story about how the titular Theresa is possessed by an extraterrestrial entity named HAL (yes... that HAL) and how she decides to leverage its superhuman abilities to make the world a better place. When you see this premise by itself, there are a few immediate expectations you might form:

(a) Theresa is forced into a situation where she must rapidly develop and learn to accept responsibility for a vast power she's obtained.
(b) The narrative will make some commentary on the nature of power, and the potential dangers of one person being able to affect worldwide affairs on a whim.
(c) The main character will be presented with difficult problems and will have to devise interesting, clever solutions to those problems.

Well, as I mentioned above, the character is a static, perfect entity (characters in the book literally refer to her as a ""perfect person, incapable of improving in any way"") and the novel has no long-term narrative objectives so we are left to find value in expectation (c). Indeed, the majority of this book is about how Theresa is given some variety of impossible tasks and is forced to use HAL to solve them. This is fine by itself and can be interesting, but the execution of this formula is ultimately the author's major failure.

The book is essentially a sequence of discrete episodes, with each episode having a common formula: Theresa encounters problem X, everybody tells Theresa that problem X has no solution, Theresa shocks everybody with solution Y. This is not an uncommon structure in literature: it is the structure of detective fiction, a genre I wholeheartedly enjoy. However, there are really only two ways to make this formula work:

(1) Place the reader in a position where they can actually solve the problem by themselves (often by leaving hints about the solution or by constraining the scenario in some way).
(2) Make solutions that are satisfying, ridiculous, or entertaining by themselves.

""Empress Theresa"" largely fails at both of these tasks.

One of the biggest recurring issues of the book is that the reader never gets a clear description of HAL's abilities. HAL can stop the wind. HAL can lift earth. HAL can put people in comas. On top of this, Theresa has an extremely wide understanding of random topics, from archaeology, physics, mathematics, chemistry, and fluid mechanics. Do you know what happens when dark matter interacts with an hydrogen atom? Neither do I. This makes (1) impossible, since to us, the solution space for any problem is impossibly large. There's no way to narrow down what Theresa is going to do because we have no idea what HAL is capable of. There are no rules. Rules are required for any kind of mystery/puzzle story. Since we can't solve the problems ourselves, we just have to pray that the solutions she devises are at least interesting.

To make a long story short, they kind of are. The high point of the story for me was when she decides to pick up Jerusalem and place it in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. It's so stupid and silly that it's entertaining. There are other solutions that are weird and bizarre enough to make me interested. However, this is where the other critical failure of the book comes in: the pacing. The majority of the book is super rigorous about Theresa's solutions: every phone call she makes, every experiment she runs, and every specific instruction she sends HAL are described in excruciating detail. Any interest I may have had in a fun revelation is diluted amongst hundreds of words about the minutiae of tectonic plate behavior and oceanography. By the time the problem is actually solved I just don't care anymore. The combination of all these factors results in a reading experience that is just a slog from start to finish.

=======================

TL;DR The book has almost no entertainment value, even as schlock: it's not intellectually stimulating, it's not charming, and, worst of all, it's tedious. Would not recommend even as a meme."
Empress Theresa,Harper,"May 24, 2020",5.0,"I have never read anything that even comes close to the caliber of Empress Theresa. Like most people, I originally took interest in the book once I heard about its infamy in certain online circles, both in the quality of the book and the history of its author. Now I consider myself a connoisseur of Bad Books, and seeing that the Kindle book was only $3, I took the dive.

It is genuinely impossible to describe the experience of reading this book in full. Pages upon pages of technical jargon, no context of space or time, characters that make pieces of paper look robust and fully formed. This is not a book. This is a character study of Norman Boutin. His obsession with Theresa's perfection and beauty, often taking whole paragraphs, occasionally to describe in vivid detail how beloved she is by everyone and how beautiful her hair is and how perfect her breasts are is the kind of case that sexual psychoanalysts could only ever dream of getting there hands on.

This is only a fraction of the feelings that this book brings out of me. I think I could write my own book simply analyzing a documenting my time and experience with this novel. Empress Theresa has fundamentally changed who I am and how I look at literature.

I would never advice someone read this in its entirety, but if you must, know that I am on your side, God is on your side, and most importantly, Empress Theresa is on your side."
Empress Theresa,Chad B,"September 3, 2017",1.0,"I hardly ever write opinion pieces on this site, but I feel as if something simply must be said regarding Norman Boutin's truly horrible work 'Empress Theresa.' While I would never encourage people to give this author money for his book, I highly suggest checking out the multiple free chapters available on Boutin's site (see the bizarre, rambling description here on the book's Goodreads page for links to said samples). Beyond the cringe-worthy, childish prose and spelling errors lies a veritable mess of a narrative that all serves as a long-winded excuse for the author's gross obsession with a teenage girl and inane religious proselytizing all under the fascinatingly wrong-headed guise of a female empowerment piece. Even more strange is the story surrounding this book's publication and Boutin's penchant for constantly berating and arguing with online critics who dare call out his work for what it is. If you want to experience the worst that the medium of literature has to offer, look no further than 'Empress Theresa.'"
Empress Theresa,Noisebird,"February 22, 2021",5.0,"This is a masterclass in anti-literature. Seriously; every single English or writing major of any kind MUST read this book. Possibly students of psychology too. It is beyond fascinatingly bad; this is boomer Wattpad fantasy of the creepiest, blandest, and most brain bogglingly and mind flayingly *wrong* kind. It's like eating an excruciatingly large bowl of long expired, knock off, plain cheerios and occasionally finding a rotting toe (and sometimes an entire foot!). When you think things can't get any worse in the story, they absolutely DO! The most delicious part of this abyss of brainworms is that it progressively deteriorates for around 400 agonizing pages and comes to a stunningly ""what-the-fuck"" conclusion.

Empress Theresa,Tanzila Tabassum Zisha (Annabel Lee),"March 14, 2020",,Sometimes I find such weird sh*t on goodreads...
Empress Theresa,Dayton,"August 26, 2020",1.0,"I went into this knowing that this book was dubious at best, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt. The internet loves controversy, and the author did nothing but stir the pot. But as for the book...

Oh my god this is the worst thing I’ve ever read. It’s actually fascinating. There are basic, elementary concepts, that are factually wrong. Ideas are introduced then abandoned. There is no plot. Characters aren’t characters. Dialogue is stilted and there are practically no descriptions for anything.

The “plot” is that a girl named Theresa gets poorly defined superpowers when she encounters a fox who shoots an alien space monster into her stomach in a scene flushed with creepy undertones. From here she uses her new abilities for self gain and evil while everyone she encounters gushes over how good she is, despite doing clearly evil and selfish things with the alien.

Theresa is the biggest issue this book has. She is described, at length, as being a “good girl” and the author makes sure to reiterate that she is a “good girl” on almost every page. Not through actions, but by out and out saying “she’s a good girl.” Her actions paint her as a narcissistic and evil woman with stunted emotional and moral growth. She puts people into danger constantly, possibly getting them killed, she dooms the world and plays victim and while she’s dooming the world and people are starving, she takes a vacation because she is tired of helping. Anyone who calls her out is deemed an antagonist by the book, to the point she practically holds someone hostage because they spoke out against her for ruining the world’s economy by creating gold and and making everyone “rich.”

Theresa is possibly the most dim witted protagonist I’ve ever seen. Now this can work, as long as a less than intelligent protagonist has a good support ensemble. Theresa does not. There is not a single intelligent character in this book. Everyone is supremely unintelligent. “Experts” consistently get basic, sometimes elementary, concepts wrong in their respective fields. From how weather works, to medicine to even firefighters. Everything is wrong. At one point, doctors try to revive Theresa after she’s been DEAD FOR TWO WEEKS. And they believe her husband when he tells them that she has an alien monster inside her. Then there is the big interview where Theresa is trying to explain what HAL, her alien, is. Up until this point Theresa has barely been able to form coherent sentences, often relying on simple one word replies, but goes on at length about HAL being made of dark matter and tries to explain what dark matter is, and she contradicts her self sometimes paragraphs apart. No one calls her out, everyone just accepts it without a shred of evidence.

Then there is HAL. Described as an alien on one page, then not an alien on another. He arrives on earth and, according to Theresa, saw her mother raking leaves and thought the rake was an extra appendage, then chooses Theresa because she must be special with this line “don’t you see, HAL could have been here a hundred million years, but he never saw anyone raking leaves before!” It would take us hours to unpack everything wrong with that line, but you are smart so we don’t have to. HAL gives Theresa powers based on external stimuli. She’s trying to bend something, give her boosted strength. This concept is interesting and would work. What would happen if someone exceptionally unintelligent gets super powers? But HAL also randomly gives Theresa various other powers despite her claiming that HAL ONLY gives her powers based on what she needs. She randomly gets a targeting reticule in her vision, which she uses for self gain, and bestows upon her the ability to generate huge amounts of heat, that appears for one chapter then is seemingly forgotten about. HAL is a deus ex machine in a personified form. He only exists to create and then solve situations in the novel, in the most contrived ways possible.

I could spend hours of your time telling you why this book just doesn’t work. I’m not joking when I say that EVERY PARAGRAPH, has elements that are wrong. But here is the thing. I recommend you read this book. This is the purest, most undiluted example, of how not to write. Both from the novel standpoint, and how to conduct yourself as an author. This book is fascinating in just how wrong it is. I’ve read it 3 times. First out of morbid curiosity. Then 2 more just trying to comprehend what I was reading. Each time, I found new things I hadn’t noticed before. Like I must have blacked out while reading the part where the author insists that this 17 year old is super sexy and gets married so she can “do it.” As good catholic girls do, naturally. This book is full of creepy undertones. Theresa is over sexualized frequently. “My cleavage charmed the crowd.” Said the maybe 17 year old.

But does this book cross into the so-bad-it’s-good, zone. Is it like the movie “The Room?” Where it’s so bad that it’s actually entertaining? No. It starts out that way. It starts out so fascinatingly terrible, but then after chapter 4, it just grinds to an absolute halt. Entire sections become meaningless filler.

All that being said. Yes, I still do recommend you read this book. Don’t give the author money, oh hell no. But if you find it abandoned on a park bench somewhere or laying in a dumpster, or someone desperately tries to give it to you because it’s brought pestilence upon their home, then yes. Then give it a read."
Empress Theresa,Tupaq,"February 6, 2020",1.0,"I've watched Fredrik Knudsen and KrimsonRogue reviewing it and read some bits and pieces available online and I can attest that this is the worst book of all time in all the good and bad ways.

It would have been brilliant and enjoyable if ""Empress Theresa"" was a movie by Neil Breen. But as a written and printed-out novel with the intention of this and its author being taken seriously, this is just bad.

The full embellishment of scenes, dialogues and descriptions, that easily could have been shortened or completely left out, makes the plot dull and forgettable for the most parts. In fact, the hybris of Norman himself and his disturbed relationship to criticism outshines his own work.

I give Norman a ""You've tried at least"" star. He failed miserably as a writer and is overall an awful individual, but he gave us something special."
Empress Theresa,Cameron Robertson,"January 11, 2020",1.0,"I want to fucking kill myself, holy shit"
Empress Theresa,J.S. Frankel,"January 16, 2020",1.0,"I had to give one star because Goodreads won't allow zero stars or negative integers. What is bad about this novel is that A) it's overlong by at least one-hundred and fifty pages; B) it's got poorly constructed sentences and lots of punctuation and grammatical mistakes; C) the characters are nothing more than cardboard cutouts.

Ex: Having the main character say she was cute as heck in the opening sentence and her character never changes. She's all-powerful, given that power by an alien (or so we think) presence...and she calls it HAL? Theresa is all-wise, practically omniscient...(yes, ellipses)...in short, she's perfect. And if a character is perfect and doesn't change for any reason--good or bad--during the course of the novel, what's the point? Even if they take a turn to the Dark Side, at least they changed.

There are other instances of the author saying repeatedly that Theresa is a good Catholic girl. Not that I'm an expert on Catholicism, but having Theresa dress provocatively and flirt with another guy to make her boyfriend mad--that doesn't sound like being a good Catholic to me, although I could be wrong.

This is one of these DNF efforts. It's not just fan-fiction, IMO, but BAD fan-fiction. The author has gained notoriety mainly by arguing against anyone and everyone who didnt like the book. Arguing with reviewers is a sure way to get readers to lose interest in a novel, and it's a cardinal sin for the writer to do so. Hopefully, the author has learned not to do that.

I really can't recommend this book to anyone. It's simply not good, IMO, for anyone of any age."

Empress Theresa,Tyler M,"March 15, 2019",1.0,"Empress Theresa: An Adventure in Illiteracy…

Can you give a book zero stars?

Characters:
They are all thin, human-shaped, cardboard cut-outs that speak and act like emotionless robots. The “attempts” at emotion is either bland, cringe inducing, boring, or outright hilarious at how badly they express what the actor is feeling.
There is Absolutely ZERO character development in this, each robot walks onto the stage feeling and acting one way and they leave the stage at the end feeling and acting the same way. Nobody learns anything, nobody changes through adversity, this isn’t a novel, it’s a 400+ page Sermon about how you should act and what you should believe. 1/5: No Cowbell detected, needs a lot more.

Plot:
There is none… This burning dumpster-fire is a laundry list of things that Mrs. Mary Sue perfect does and is basically a 100,000 word sermon on the merits of a pure life and Catholicism. I could go so far as to say that this is a thinly veiled fetish piece of religious erotica modeled after Joan of Arc, but that would be giving it WAY too much credit. It’s more along the lines of a female Jesus… which is even odder.
It’s essentially; girl gets mysterious powers and the government tries to do things while she reacts and fucks up the world in the process. A Tom Clancy novel this is not, although it TRIES to include elements of a spy novel; all with hilarious and cringy results that were Mr. Clancy alive would have him in fits of rage to see it. 1/5: Some Cowbell here and there, needs a lot more.

World-Building:
There is almost zero world-building throughout. Conversations seem as though they are disembodied voices floating in a dark void. When a scene is bothered to be described or set up at all, it is a short one or two sentence blurb giving the absolute minimum amount of information. Which is usually not even relevant to the scene at hand.
Large sections are spent describing things that have no meaning and go nowhere. This coupled with the pacing and flow issues makes the reader lost and confused more times than not.

Structure:
This is a first person novel of a female character written by a male, not a bad thing nor should it be held against it, but the fact that she talks about her body a lot and certain other things makes it a little creepy. That and the fact that the author clearly doesn’t have any idea of how a teenager thinks, let alone a 10-19 year old girl, and you begin to understand the level if cringe and believability throughout.
The author has also demonstrated that he doesn’t know the difference between ‘Narrative’ and ‘Narration’ within the comments section in response to other reviews. So, you can imagine then why the books structured narrative is completely nonexistent. There is nothing that really drives the story other than “because’ which makes the reactions of those involved seem wooden and unrealistic.

Nit Picks:
Spelling and Grammar… Seriously, how hard is it to edit your work or even run it through a basic word processor? There are a host of FREE programs that will gleefully point out almost every error I came across in this book. Short, choppy, and unconnected sentences are pieced together form the most painful paragraphs my eyes have ever had to scrape across. If literature had an allegory for water boarding or eating glass, this would be it; I may even contact a couple Senators to see if they could stock Guantanamo with this.
Preachier than Jesus… I think even the Lamb of God might find this book offensive in one way or another. Not for its CLEAR religious undertones, but in the ham-fisted way they are inserted and dealt with, and the SMUG tone that is conveyed while doing so."
Empress Theresa,Jasmin,"June 2, 2020",1.0,"Hot garbage.

Edit:

“I´m Theresa, the younger daughter of Edward and Elizabeth Sullivan, I hope it´s not bragging to say that I was cute as heck at age ten. Everybody in the family said so.”

Aight so I haven´t read the whole book, I don’t remember much of the story, and this will probably be a bit messy, but here we go. I would be a bit more lenient if it were not for the fact that the author claims it is one of the greatest works of fiction of all time, and that it should be required reading in High School yada yada. But in reality, this story is just…incredibly bad. The pacing is horrible and dragged out, and foreshadowing is awful (to quote KrimsonRouge “I´ve seen better foreshadowing on the expiration date on my milk.”). Characters are two-dimensional/flat and they are there to either suck Theresa´s di** or hate on her because she has no flaws (AND the characters who dislike her is written as absolute braindead idiots).
A messianic (like she is basically Jesus) and omnipotent mary-sue. Theresa is loved by basically the whole planet for…reasons I don’t really know. Or care to know. She radiates an aura of ´goodness´ that awes everyone in the goddamn room - she is the perfect paragon of good despite being a narcissistic, selfish, and petty, which is rewarded or glossed over. PROFESSIONALS in their fields are awed at her wisdom. A lot of space is for describing her wardrobe, some being incredibly skimpy. This is funny because one of the apparent selling points of the story is that there is no sex although the author constantly sexualizes Theresa (""My green outfit was modest, only five inches above the knees and with not much cleavage, but didn't hide my well-turned figure. All right, my chest and butt were well outlined"").

Man, this does not include the ridiculous events that happen in the book, such as that one time Theresa is kidnapped by the government (and the president of America?) and sentenced to be executed by an atomic bomb. And I´ve heard that she also puts the whole planet in a 600-year coma and gives birth to 420 children during the time.
Yeaaaah, I´m done."
Empress Theresa,Tyler,"November 22, 2020",1.0,"What's there to say about this that hasn't already been said? All I know is that the author to this day is still defending himself on Amazon and Twitter and calling out ""trolls"" who don't believe that Empress Theresa is the greatest book of all time. The man himself is unapproachable and is incapable of having a decent conversation with anyone.

But since this is a book review and not an author review, let's talk a little about the writing itself. I'll keep this brief. Empress Theresa is one of the least likable or relatable characters at all time. Everything in this book revolves around her. She is an annoying, belligerent, callous, deceitful, egotistical, foolish, garish, hypocritical, ignorant, jeering, klutzy, lying, maniacal, nasty, obtuse, pitiless, quarrelsome, reckless, selfish, tyrannical, uncaring, vapid, worthless, xenophobic, and yellow zealot who expects the world to worship not only the ground she walks on, but the air she breathes.

All of the other characters are undeveloped flat caricatures wishing only to praise Theresa. The plot makes no sense. The dialogue is so unnatural that it sounds like Norman talking instead of anyone else. The prose is really telly, and not interesting to read. In short, avoid this garbage like your life depended on it (Probably because it does)."
Empress Theresa,Nadia,"March 5, 2020",1.0,"Only reason I read this book (I use that word very loosely to describe this thing) is because I was gifted it and told to read it as a dare.
This book is just a random mess that doesn't really make sense and if I wasn't dared to read it I would have given up after the first chapter.

The main character Theresa is incredibly annoying she spend a lot of her time talking about how perfect she is or complaining about how unfair everything is or how everyone is watching her.
To top it off shes also the host to an alien that makes her the most powerful being on Earth so Theresa has taken it upon herself to save the world because shes the perfect teenager and would never abuse all the power shes been given (while complaining how unfair it all is)

Theresa is a perfect example of every terrible Mary Sue trope squished into one character.

Overall this book is terrible and I can't think of any reason to recommend it. I was told this book won the award of worst book of the decade and if that is true it has definitely earned that award.
I'm just glad I didn't spend any money on buying this and will end this review by saying this is a very very very bad book."

Empress Theresa,Alexander T,"February 8, 2022",1.0,"Now here me out here. This book, almost, could have been the 'Freddy Got Fingered' of literature.

Now to anyone who is a fan of that cult classic, I mean that in a good way. For those who don't know, Freddy Got Fingered was a movie written by and starring Tom Green, a somewhat successful comedian who employed a lot of ''random shock humor'' in his work.

When given the opportunity to make his own movie, Green took this as an opportunity to make the most disturbing, inconsistent and unapologetic film to ever hit the big screens. From day one his goal was to win a Razzie. He didn't care that critics destroyed it and audiences didn't know what to think because thats exactly what he intended to happen. This was a guy who played by his own rules, and took every ounce of criticism with stride and didn't care in the slightest. In his eyes, the film was a masterpiece, not because he thinks its good but because it served its purpose to enrage and confuse common movie goers into watching it and fueling its legacy, which continues to this day.

You'd be forgiven for thinking Norman Boutin (which may or may not be the authors real name) wanted to do something similar. Empress Theresa is written inconsistently from the very first chapter, with almost random events and tangents that add nothing to the overall story. Even the idea of a young woman with Superman level powers and almost no character flaws that would make Rey 'Skywalker' blush, sounds like something that would bomb for how formulaic and boring it appears. Almost like Naked Came the Stranger, which was intentionally terrible, but ended up becoming a best seller.

But here's why I said it almost worked. Norman Boutin is not Tom Green. Boutin believes his work is a masterpiece, period, and that any and all forms of constructive criticism is heresy of the highest order. Unwavering in his ideals, Boutin has locked himself in a soundproof room with a one way mirror so he can see view everything without having to worry about others finding out how he really feels. But if his own website is anything to go off of, he doesn't handle it very well. If Tom Green had written a book like this, you know he'd walked out to receive his national book award for the worst book of 2014 with his own red carpet and a bottle of Jack Daniels.

It should be noted that I barely paid a dime for this book. I found it randomly at my local goodwill and, as someone who has a habit of reading bad literature, I couldn't help myself but think at how much better this could have been. I don't think even a great author could save this book from obscurity or failure, but at least it would have been an attempt."
Empress Theresa,rogue,"July 4, 2020",1.0,"Friends, Romans, country-men; when one lacks confidence in their writing, feels hopeless in their abilities, or needs to be reminded of how far they have come as a writer, they can read the free chapters made available by the author of this very book. I, for one, often hit writers blocks and long stretches of helplessness with my work, however this book offers me great peace. It gives me a beautifully illustrated guide of what not to do, of what I should strive to be as far away from as possible. This goes not only for my writing, but also for who I should be as a person when receiving criticism.

In much the way that film schools will often use The Room to teach students everything you shouldn't do, I feel that this book - along with the acclaimed Onision trilogy - should be used in a similar manner. Everything has a purpose, after all."

I was able to get through it and find some level of enjoyment by viewing Theresa as an unreliable narrator with an extreme case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder. From wiki, symptoms include:
-A grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g. exaggerating achievements and talents, expecting to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements)
-Preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love
-Believing that they are ""special"" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions)
-Requiring excessive admiration
-A sense of entitlement (unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with their expectations)
-Being interpersonally exploitative (taking advantage of others to achieve their own ends)
-Lacking empathy: unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others
-Often being envious of others or believing that others are envious of them
-Showing arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes

Theresa checks all the boxes, and viewed through this lens, the book actually makes sense."
Empress Theresa,Claire,"February 13, 2020",1.0,"This book is basically the boomer equivalent of some slimy neckbeard writing garbage fanfiction about his anime waifu OC, complete with childish prose, quotes from better books, typos, choppy pacing, and a protagonist who has neither agency nor personality, and yet is lauded as a goddess by all of the other dull characters in this book.

And as the trash icing on this trash cake, said protagonist (Theresa) is presented in a highly sexual and fetish-y way, with the 60-year-old male author (Norman Boutin) taking special care to talk about what a ""good girl"" Theresa is, her luxurious mane of hair, the way her shirt fits over her breasts, and the way that men ogle and drool wherever she goes. It also doesn't help that the entire story is told in first person, which makes ""good girl"" Theresa sound incredibly narcissistic.

Read it for the memes, read it to troll Boutin, but don't pay money for this. Read the sample chapters on Boutin's website, or watch one of the many livestreams and reviews of this book on YouTube. You'll get all of the hilarity, but with only half the torture of actually reading it."
Empress Theresa,Madz H,"September 1, 2021",1.0,"Paraphrasing but....""Theresa's safety was more important than the innocent lives of strangers.""And much of the book follows the same mindset.
She is no hero. Everything she does is for her own gain and praise. She is a self-serving, big-headed, haughty, brat who cares only about what others can give to her or how they can worship her. A disgusting narcissistic, tyrannical, hypocritical, poorly written super villain, but written as though we're supposed to see her as a goddess and hero to humankind?? Oh, and she's only 18 for most of the story, which makes sense because she has the mental capacity of a child.
She has soooo much money, she doesn't know what to do with it, and how??? BECAUSE SHE DESTROYED THE ECONOMY BY RAINING GOLD, SILVER, AND DIAMONDS FROM NOWHERE!!!! She is stupid, reckless, and written as though she can do no wrong, even though every problem she solves is of her own doing!!!! This book is a slough of horrible writing, bad editing, and DUMB CRAP happening. One of the worst books ever written. Incredible, in fact, in its incompetence."
Empress Theresa,CONSTANCE,"December 24, 2021",1.0,"In the words of Tyra Banks, ""I wanted to give you a 0. I cannot so I'll give you a 1""

I hate this. And I love bad books. I love trashy, poorly written things that are just a blast to read. This book just angers me. Nothing makes sense. Everything contradicts itself. Theresa behaviors like a self insert in a wattpad story - and not a very good one at that. Norman made an OC and proceeded to spend the whole book fawning over how great she is. This book is a wondrous display of incompetence.

One positive I can give it, is that the idea of being able to shut off any car a person gets in is petty enough that I like it. If only it had been used to good instead of evil.

I recommend reading this book if you also wanna lose brain cells"
Empress Theresa,Coral Reeves,"August 21, 2020",1.0,"I was tricked into buying this second hand from a person I THOUGHT was a friend. I thought this was a children's book because of the cover. Like a collection of children's tales and stuff. Had I known he just wanted to get rid of this horrible book I would have hit him over the head with this. Is this the book version of The Room? This female protagonist is pretty delusional and I've read Handbook for Mortals! Was this book written by a troll? Is the author trolling humanity with this book?
I'm going to donate this book to the public library so people don't have to buy this anymore.
I just hope they don't throw it in the dumpster like I wanted to do."
Empress Theresa,Grant Dominguez,"August 13, 2021",4.0,"Unbelievable. This book is that very special kind of bad: every new page is some new horror or delusion. There were several parts when I just said ""what the fuck?"" out loud. This is The Room of bad writing."
Empress Theresa,Janinanin,"September 20, 2021",1.0,I am genuinely amazed how laughably bad this book was
Empress Theresa,Alexis,"August 24, 2022",1.0,"Good lord, was this TERRIBLE!!!! Norman, may I ask as to how many binders you have dedicated to writing, because I have at least 7 dedicated to mine!!

This book was among the most ridiculous things I've ever read, and it makes my friend's story seem good compared to this. 😒

Theresa isn't who Norman Boutin (the author) plays her up to be. Norman plays Theresa up to be this perfect girl next door who can do no harm. Reality: Theresa is a narcissistic sociopath, and makes my estranged father look like a normal human being--and trust me when I say that my father was a real piece of s?!t. Another thing, too, is that Theresa dies, and floats on the ocean surface for two weeks, dead, while sharks are being turned into chum around her corpse.

Norman, if you're reading this, this next bit is directed strictly at you! I have connections in the health care industry, and when I asked them what they would do if they found someone who's been floating in the ocean, dead, for two weeks, they looked at me like I was insane. All they would do is bring her to shore, check for a pulse, and then declare her dead, and let the investigation ensue. Not spend 14+ hours resuscitating her only to wind up turning on some heaters... THAT'S NOT HOW ATTEMPTING TO RESUSCITATE SOMEONE WORKS, NORMAN!!!!!! It's all chest compressions, chest compressions, chest compressions; NOT TURNING ON SPACE HEATERS AND STICKING THERMOMETERS IN THE RECTUM (or Theresa's vagina in this case 🙄)!!!! Speaking of dead bodies, Norman, Theresa should be near skeletal after two weeks in the ocean currents because bodies decompose faster in water than on land. Did you do ANY research at all while writing this? If you somehow manage to figure out how commenting works on GoodReads, don't reply with the excuse that ""HAL protected her because Theresa is a good girl who can do no harm."" Also, Norman, Theresa is a narcissistic sociopath--not the good girl you think she is.

Like I said above, Theresa is not a good girl. She literally goes about virtually assassinating anyone who gets in her way. She also goes around screwing up the economy in order to ""make everyone rich"" by pulling gold, silver, diamonds, and other precious metals out of her ass--this further goes to prove that Norman did jack all for researching--somehow manages to stop the wind by falling out of the sky, and further screws up the planet by messing with the Poles so that the North Pole is now Wisconsin or Michigan.

Something that Theresa does is solve problems in such an obscure way that my brain actively disintegrates into mush because of how ridiculous things are. COKE BOTTLES AREN'T GOING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE, THERESA!! THEY'RE NOT LIFE PRESERVERS!!! Why in the world would the army even allow her to bring them onto the plane in the first place???

These characters are so 1-dimensional that it makes Bella Swan from ""Twilight"" look somewhat rounded (I don't recommend one bit!! It's an iconic abuse story, not an iconic love story!!!). Theresa is the literal definition of a Mary Sue. Everything is about her. What ""Empress"" Theresa wants, ""Empress"" Theresa gets.

That ending....God save us... I don't think Norman knows how pregnancy works... Norman, the chances of a successful pregnancy are 1 in about a million.

This book it terrible, the characters are flatter than a fridge, and all in all, I wish I hadn't read this... Yes, it's a self-published book, so I'll be a little more lenient, but the author should've done some research into this. If a 14 year old who writes for a hobby is telling someone as old as my grandfather to do a bit of research into certain things to make the story more believable, you should know that this story is bad.

Edit: I looked at Norman's website/online shrine for ""Empress Theresa,"" and now I'm offended. He praised Theresa, and he holds her on this pedestal of utmost respect. One thing that pisses me off is the fact that Theresa isn't facing any of the normal peer pressure from friends. I'm going into my second of four years of high school, and my friends were peer pressuring me into vaping not even halfway through semester 1. Norman, please attack me in the comments because I want to have a pleasant conversation with you... Don't worry, I'll be using my whole vocabulary that's at my disposal, too....

The MC is a psychotic egotistical despot with no positive points at all. She is the narrator, and it is given from her point of view, and it is her justifying how she ruins the world because... reasons. Surviving an atomic bomb explosion and a free-fall to the ocean, destroying both poles, creating stupidly ridiculous water-spouts, changing the earth's declination, putting people to sleep without a care, interfering with due judicial process because she's evil, stealing Israel from the Jews...

Something happened. A terrible thing. There are events in your life that change your life forever. At around 0:35 AM September 28th, 2020 my life was forever altered… for the worse. This is clearly satire and meant as a joke, but I’m giving this book generously , cause I believe with every fibre of my being that this book should have never been published. 
 
Why is this guy GREEN?
Have these scientists been smoking crack? 
Why was this even published?
 
I can answer two out of three questions. 
 

– Before I can answer that, we need to start at the beginning.

Dr Alexa Ashingtonford is one of the few scientists that didn't die from the coronavirus and responsible to find a vaccine. Just the thought about the virus makes Alexa verryyy excited if you know what I mean.

There is another scientist Dr. Gurtlychund who's working with her on finding a cure. Dr. Gurtlychund inserts the trial vaccine into his arm, because PLOTTWIST he has coronavirus and he would rather die testing the vaccine himself better than some children. What a man 🥵💕

After pumping the vaccine into his blood.. The winds are whisling, the lights are flickering, the mountains shaking and then silence (I'm not even joking with this, it was described like this without the mountain shaking tho).
Dr. Gurtlychund has turned into Hulk. Everything about him is bigger and I mean EVERYYTHING!!

That's the description:

Only when Alexa asked Dr. Gurtlychund if he's okay, he doesn't know a Dr. Gurtlychund. Because Dr. Gurtlychund is dead, the virus consumed him. (A silent minute for our strong warrior sacrificing himself for the greater good ✊😔)

Alexa and Hulk have a very interesting conversation







So the brilliant romance begins. The connection these two share out of this world. Never seen before 😭



AHAHAHAHA 🤣🤣🤣. This part makes me cry so hard. I have nothing more to add to that.

Their smut scene is gasoline. Other authors take notes


I mean WOOOOW! How Covid thrust his warbling member into Alexa pocket of ecstasy? Sheer BRILLIANCE. When will your favorites be on their level? The answer is never.

And they live happily ever after

Or do they???






Did Alexa die?? My brain after reading this ""book"" can't process this information.

Some more of my favorites quotes that I didn't know where to insert.




 
– This will always stay a mystery. But I'm pretty sure the author has.


– On the Amazon description This was truly the thing that was sending me LOOL excuse me ma’am or sir (cause when you click on the name on GR it shows a man) … if THIS book is your attempt at paying the bill, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you’re going to stay poor forever. Maybe think about a career change, cause uhmm… writing is not one of your strengths just saying. 

Okay, it's time to deactivate this account because 1. so I will never find more disturbing books like this and 2. I prob traumatised a lot of people with this review 😬

I often self-effacingly refer to myself as a garbage can because I read a lot of books that many people consider trashy. In fact, a lot of trash is quite excellent or at least aspires to be. Not KISSING THE CORONA VIRUS, though. This is a book that in its terribleness. Even though it's only sixteen pages, the author has charged 99 cents for it, and written something so outlandish that all of us are out there, doing all of their publicity for them. It's so evil, it's practically a Disney supervillain's scheme.



Set in a lab, KISSING THE CORONAVIRUS features a female scientist named Alexa, one of a ""crack team of scientists."" (I can only imagine that the ""crack"" in that sentence refers to crack cocaine.) Alexa enjoys her work a little too much, because the COVID specimen she has in a test tube make her so wet (and her nipples ""as hard as tic tacs""). So obviously, she's delighted when the teddybear scientist she works with takes a vaccine for COVID they made and it causes him to hulk out, COVID style, with a big, green, protinaceous dick.



The sex scenes are... about what you would expect from a book like this. It's like something a middle schooler might sit down to write if you-- inappropriately and inadvisably-- told them to write something ""hot"" (note: ). Characters kiss like they're swishing around ""chunks of microwaved fish"". The word love lotion is used, unironically, as if in an ode to Bertrice Small and her ""honey evens"" and ""love grottoes."" Alexa's breasts glisten like water balloons under the summer sun. It is the worst, most hilarious, thing that I have ever read.



Is it worth 99 cents? No. Did it make me laugh? Yes. Did it make me feel slightly sick? Yes. Should you buy it? I mean... why not. This is what happens when people are stuck at home with nothing to do. We crack open a bottle of the good stuff and start creeping over to ""the dark and shady corner of the erotica genre."" And honestly, I can't help but admire the author for putting this book out there... if only because I'm slightly secretly jealous that I didn't think of it first. Could this be the next dinosaur erotica? Maybe.



Also, I don't think this needs saying, but just in case: if you encounter the Coronavirus, you should not fuck it. Not even if it makes you horny. COVID-19 is a real pandemic and it has cost real lives (200,000 in the United States alone). Please, please, please wear a mask when you go out, carry and use hand-sanitizer, avoid touching your face in public, wash your hands well and often, and practice social distancing. Even if you don't think you're at risk, you could be saving the life of someone immuno-compromised who doesn't have the luxury of being careless.



If you're an essential employee, hats off to you for keeping our country running through these terrible times.



And if you're the author reading this, thanks for giving us all something to bond over and laugh at during quarantine. I really, really needed that.



1 star"
Kissing the Coronavirus,Hamad,"October 2, 2020",1.0,"I read this because it has been all over my social media and as someone who works daily with the virus, I couldn't say no to this!



‘What’s your name?’ she asked. ‘Call me Covid,’ he said.


This was BREATHTAKING!! Quite literally.

This year I read huge authors like Sanderson, Abercrombie, Ruthfoss and others and yet I think this author writes on a whole different level. Prepare yourself for your next favorite read after you finish this one.

I don't know where to start with this one but I think I will start with the cover, all great books have great covers & I think this follows the rule. We're gonna ignore the fact that Covid's left hand is not green because small details like that can be missed when we have an awesome cover as this one.

The writing is just magical guys, honestly this is unlike anything I have ever read. The author has great writing skills with awesome use of similes and metaphors. The book is only 16 pages long and I wanted more but the best writers can express themselves with the least possible words and this was a work of art in 16 pages.





There are 3 main characters: Alexa, Bob and Covid and they were just fleshed out and very humane (except for COVID). The way the characters were described makes them three dimensional in your mind, for example:



The author did not use Thick but THICC which shows the advanced writing skills he has.



Or here when we know that COVID has both legs and presumably feet!!

The plot is meaningful, we have Alexa who is a scientist trying to save the world and she is horny, she is so thrilled by Covid and their romance ensues.



The scientific part was well researched, the virus had its spike proteins and the test tubes were mentioned (Even though we don't use the regular ones for COVID but don't be a nudnik) and down to the protective equipment they were wearing (or the lack of it).

This is just an unusual story that will spread more than the virus did if it finds the right audience. If you are a fan of the genre, don't miss this book!

P.S: The GR author page shows a guy while the kindle speaks of the author as a she. It doesn't make a difference. Still a masterpiece!

She was supposed to cure the Coronavirus.
Instead...she fell in love with it.

This iconic book has received all kinds of reviews, yet there is one question no one has offered an answer to: What the FUCK?


dividing it into four parts to help specify what the fuck ⤵





Before we start, I should warn you that my review will include lines and quotation from this “” meaning there will be mature content, sexual innuendos, and explicit language; so proceed at your own risk. Now, *rolls up sleeves* let’s discuss this baffling phenomenon and attempt to comprehend what has just happened to humanity and



Allow me to tell you a story.

Once upon a time, there was a young woman () and she was alive in the year 2020. As you can guess, this tale is already a tragedy even before starting—but bear with me.

So Merika was going about her day as usual, which is to stay she was stuck in her rental apartment doing absolutely nothing. It was noon and her stomach was being a demanding ass as usual, so she headed to her smaller-than-her-brother’s-wife’s-bathroom kitchen, scolding, “” As the monologue——continued, she picked up her last remaining steak and wondered where the hell she was gonna find any money because dammit but with only one meal a day her fridge was still emptier than her bed and fuck but who was gonna pay the rent and gahhh but life sucked and she was only interested in one definition of sucking and .



She needed ideas and she needed them now. But, more pressingly, she also needed to pee. Killing two birds with one stone, Merika quickly entered the Workroom of Creation——and, in that holy corner of creativity, she pondered. She thought about the reason why life is such a hot mess, being the coronavirus, and how easier it all would have been if the virus didn’t bring this dull grim feeling but one where the was more prominent than the , and in that profound moment of boredom, a genius vision creeped up upon her ⤵


I know what you’re going to say—that you’ve been plenty bored and not thought of a virus making you wet and whatnot, but the thing is that you have. So as you wallow in misery, your brain grasps at anything and everything for some reprieve, and the wilder your mind the more absurd the idea it will come up with. But in normal circumstances, these thoughts would be dismissed in a flash until you’d stumble upon a solid creative thread. This was not normal circumstances.

So where were we before you interrupted me?

Her mind preoccupied, Merika left the Workroom of Creation and tried to go about her day as usual—that is, tried and , as we’ve already established that includes “being stuck in her rental apartment doing absolutely nothing.” Thus, switching TV channels and assaulted with death after death, Merika opened her chat with her bestie ⤵































Despite having been unceremoniously abandoned by her crappy best friend, Merika couldn’t deny that she might just have had the best laugh of her lifetime and now she could no longer even attempt to get this iconic image off her mind. So she, quite gleefully, proceeded to open the chat with her second bestie and write, “”

And thus the premise of was born.




I mentioned how, under normal circumstances, our wild, absurd thoughts are thrown right into the metaphorical trash bin of our brains, and how the stress of this pandemic is not normal circumstances at all. And, you see, there are only so many people you can reach through direct messages. So stuck with boredom, a need to scrap together some cash, a gigantic amount of horniness, and one joke, you begin to write.

That’s exactly what Merika did.

Merika had never written literally anything before, but how hard could it be? First, , so Merika opened Google and searched “” and found this ⤵


Okay the green Hulk guy, let’s call him Covid, needed to have these proteins. So Merika wrote ⤵


Great! Now, Easy peasy. She added ⤵





That being done, Covid also required , you know, to actually sound like a person and for Alexa to thoroughly fall in love with him. And ⤵


Superb! But ⤵


Lastly, Thus Merika decided to write ⤵


Then, after successfully stealing ’s pen name and picture, our aspiring author sat back and gazed at her masterpiece. Nodding, she thought, “”



Four things, I think ⤵

✦ Let’s face it, the COVID-19 pandemic has effectively uprooted any possibility of dating () and a large portion of the society () is——brimming with horny thoughts, deprived of “” or, you know, the other way around. As the author so aptly and perceptively phrases it ⤵


✦ Who think of how researchers stuck in their small little brick cubes get bored out of their minds? () —literally, one of them deciding to test an experimental cure on himself without informing anyone and the other comparing a virus specimen to a “” and wanting it to do things to her. Makes sense, right?

Please tell me it does and that you understand. I need you to tell me you understand. Because this needs to make sense right now or I will have to face the fact that we are, as a species, insane morons.

✦ This book genuinely addresses the sexism in STEM, showing how, because “” she is overlooked as an idiot by her male co-worker; ignoring that But let’s focus on the positive, I’m trying to make sense of why this fuckery has gone viral, okay?

✦ Ultimately, the question of what the fuck would make humanity want to read this book can be answered by pointing out three major factors: Shock. Curiousity. The need for a good laugh. It’s impossible to read of how “” and not stare wild eyed at your screen, unable to decide whether to burst out laughing or claw out your eyes—better, your brain. And

Plus, I did not know that a clitoris could judder until I read this line: “” It’s even...educational. Bravo.



Simply put, DOOM.

Call me a doomsayer or a buzz kill if you want, but I ask you to think: What does it mean that the addition of some pressure to the usual equation of boredom + horny urges can make the crossing of lines so easy and, indeed, ? Because some things should just not become a joke. I might personally have zero awareness of “sensitivity” if I’m not constantly trying, but I put in the effort and so I know that you call COVID-19, cancer, or malaria , no matter how well-meaning you are.


I leave you with one final question:



Having now been infected with the virus for the 2nd time despite not leaving the house for months, I’m starting to think it’s in love with me—I’ll make sure not to succumb to its charms."

Kissing the Coronavirus,Matilda,"June 28, 2021",2.0,"This is the best, worst thing I’ve ever read

Firstly, thank you Phuong for bringing this masterpiece to my attention. My life would not have been complete without it.

“She was supposed to cure the Coronavirus. Instead…she fell in love with it.”




This might be the best introduction to a book I’ve read. It makes absolutely no sense, yet complete sense. I basically laughed the entire time I read this novella.



THE ERECT PENIS COMMENT LMAOOO how did the author come up with this shit, it’s perfect.

Not that the plot matters, but Alexa is a doctor working on the cure to COVID-19. Like literally in the first few paragraphs, she tries to fuck herself with a test tube full of COVID.





BUT, she gets interrupted by her boss with a micropenis. Alexa informs her boss that she has finished the tests for the COVID cure, which she manipulated(for some damn reason) by adding more COVID to it. Her boss wants to test the cure on himself because he has been infected with COVID already. When he injects himself, something happens or should I say

Yep, the boss becomes COVID-19 or rather Covid because that’s what this gigantic, protein-spiked, green creature with a huge dick says his name is.

Long story short, they fuck and she’s in love.








How come when COVID entered my body, didn't enter my body??

I literally cannot even with this book.

First off, what the fuck did I just read?

Secondly, how did it take 5 MONTHS for me to find out about this book!?

I literally read this novella in about 15 minutes, and I still don't know what to write in my review. There were so many WTF moments in this book, the least of which were about the heroine falling in love with COVID. I admit to reading some weird genres, but NEVER have I read a before. COVID wasn't even the worst part though, and the sexualized virus is not the reason why I'm rating this so low. I'm an equal opportunity reader and try to give everything a fair chance. But the writing in this one was so SO cringey and did-she-really-just-think-that-wtfuckkk that I just could not. Let me show you.

Our heroine thinking about her non-attractive coworker:

How our heroine describes kissing her lover, Covid:

Our heroine thinking about the important things finally:

The heroine being named ""Alexa"" was just the icing on this fishy hotdog cake as I read the entire thing in Amazon Alexa's monotonous yet sassy voice. I'm glad this book is in KU because at least the author is getting paid for my morbid curiosity.

Kissing the Coronavirus,Dilek VT,"October 2, 2020",,"WTF is this?
What kind of BS is that?



Why would anyone write such an absurd book and how is it even published?

Look at the cover. He is green.
GREEN, for God's sake?!



And he is covered in small, green bumps - like the virus itself. And he calls himself Covid.
Yeah, lovely!

Kissing the Coronavirus,Silvia,"September 30, 2020",1.0,"I started this fully intending to give it 5 stars because come on, you have to be a genius to write something so bad but I'll have to go with the more mainstream 1 star!

I laughed my ass off so that was exactly what I needed, but while I could deal with uh, whatever this was, my inner scientist couldn't take the scientific inaccuracies (where inaccuracies is the kindest euphemism I've ever used). I wish I could have turned that part of my brain off but alas I couldn't :(

Anyway this is obviously meant to be 5 minutes of fun and I did give almost myself an asthma attack from laughing so y'know it kinda worked"
Actors Anonymous,Casey,"April 22, 2014",2.0,"This James Franco book was really very James Franco. It was the most James Franco sort of James Franco book I have ever read. You can tell that the author, James Franco, really loves James Franco. If you enjoyed my commentary about this James Franco book by James Franco you might like to read Actor's Anonymous by James Franco. James Franco."
Actors Anonymous,Christine,"October 6, 2013",1.0,"Actors Anonymous calls itself a novel, but really, it is a collection of short stories and ramblings, loosely based around the concept of Alcoholics Anonymous. In theory, this seems like it could be an interesting idea – a behind-the-scenes look written by a famous actor about the seedy underside of the acting industry. However, the problem here is that this book has no central cohesive plot. Franco isn't able to weave all of the stories together in a way that means anything. Each narrator of each story sounds exactly the same, despite being different characters and storylines (which is to say, like they're written as Franco). There's also an entire chapter of mediocre poetry devoted to River Phoenix.

I know that I probably wasn't supposed to read this book as James Franco's life experiences, because technically it's a “novel.” But I, and surely a great number of people, can't help it. It's just too much Franco peeking out between the pages. For example, there's a story about a freshman girl in college (from her perspective) who loses her virginity to none other than James Franco. Really? Couldn't he have been a bit more creative? Had he decided to make this into a memoir or an exposé, this would make more sense, but as it is it just makes him look obscenely egotistical.

And how can anyone take this book seriously when Franco pens such gems as “I used to care about how I looked. Now I don't care as much. Maybe it's because I'm so handsome.”? Is James Franco really self-aware, and this is just one big satire on himself, or is he truly that deluded about his own talent?

A lot his “characters” are homophobic and misogynistic. Most, if not all, of his descriptions of women are simple objectifications, describing either how ugly and unattractive they are, or how fabulously hot they are (in much more lewd language), and rarely are they brought into the story without sex being involved. A character also casually rapes a woman. If there was such a thing as a Bechdel test for books, this book would fail spectacularly. Gay people are described with all of the classiness of a train wreck, with slurs and insults, mostly, despite the fact that his characters seem fascinated by queer sexuality in general. His characters have no depth, and it's painful to read.

At one point, Franco writes, “My work is my life and my life is my work. And something like this – this book – is totally free of the pressures of being popular, because I don't make my living off of books, I make my living off of acting.” And thank God for that. Stick to acting, okay, Franco? Really. You've written a few books, you can call yourself a published author, now stop it. Don't make any more people suffer because they saw your name on the cover and thought you might be a good writer. is pretentious pseudo-intellectualism at its finest, and likely won't even appeal to his biggest fans. Stay far away."
Actors Anonymous,Barry Wightman,"November 20, 2013",1.0,"Famous Actor James Franco has written something. The book’s cover describes it as “James Franco’s brilliant debut novel."" Ah. A clue — it is a ""novel.”

Here’s how it begins:

“I am the Actor. I am alive in 2013 and I was alive in 1913. … I am Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando and Jimmy Stewart ...”

Uh oh.

If you’re of a certain age, you remember Barry Manilow’s chart-topping ‘70s megahit “I Write the Songs,” written by Beach Boy Bruce Johnston. A charming, thoroughly treacly and sappy tune: “I’ve been alive forever and I wrote the very first song … I am music …” You know how it goes. (And it’s okay to like it — I’m a recovering musical snob.)

Manilow’s record sold millions. It’s in your head now, isn’t it? Yes, there it is.

Sorry.

I am here to report that Famous Actor James Franco’s annoying novel, Actors Anonymous, is not in my head. In fact, I’m having trouble finding some good parts to share with you. Yet, through the magic of Hollywood celebrity and a few very nice famous writer dust-jacket blurbs (wow, Franco owes them big), the book will sell well — Amy Hempel gushes, “eloquent and suitably scorching.” Gary Shteyngart glows, “subversively funny and provocatively honest.”

So there I was as I settled down with Actors Anonymous all set to dig it. Eloquent and subversive? I’m there — count me in.

Then I read it.

Eloquent? Just don’t see it.

Subversive? If you mean playing fast and loose with convention, throwing out any fictional rule book, blurring lines between reality and a made-up world — sure. Yes.

I couldn’t wait for it to end.

Don’t get me wrong, you’ve got to admire Franco. He’s a talented, smart guy — actor, director, writer and, according to his publicist, a Ph.D. candidate at Yale. Go for it, James! Gotta love anybody going for that ultimate, terminal degree. And I’ve got to hand it to him for taking major risks with this thing. Some say Actors Anonymous is “experimental,” “a postmodern sleight of hand.” And hey, he’s got an epigraph by W. B. Yeats. Okay.

The whole thing’s a mess.

A very loosely threaded (dare I say, imperceptibly connected?) collection of 12 “Steps” and 12 “Traditions” of an entity known as Actors Anonymous (not so loosely based on Alcoholics Anonymous), the book uses many narrative voices, and they all sound alike. Call me crazy, but isn’t that James Franco, his voice, the famous actor, our author, behind that nearly transparent scrim of a fictional curtain? Is it fiction or what?

Maybe it doesn’t matter.

The “characters” are mostly young men struggling in LA, trying to make it, mostly slipping off the bottom rung of the star-maker machine’s ladder, each playing life fast and loose in all manner of awkward and brutal sexuality, controlled substances, you name it. Like out of a slickly sleazy, say, Steely Dan tune about dealers, hustlers and losers, minus any attempt to show the slightest dignity, humor or bits of beauty in the characters you might find in everyday low-rent life. For instance:

There’s a guy who works the all-night drive-through at an L.A. McDonalds who has obviously joyless bathroom sex with one of the burger-flipping guys on the crew. Probably the only bit of the book with a whiff of narrative. The writing? William S. Burroughs or Henry Miller, it ain’t.

There’s a terrible long poem about the long-dead actor River Phoenix:

“Hello James, it’s River.
Where do you think I’m calling from?”

There’s a long scene of a Parisian seduction of The Angel by The Actor, complete with multiple multi-colored fonts, footnotes, “missing text.” Sounds promising, but with characters named Diarrhea, Cunty and little in the way of “story,” well, your mileage may vary. This section does contain the best line in the book:

“The seduction of the Virgin was as smooth as a bullet through a birthday cake.”

Charming, eh?

There are long chapters of short, declarative paragraphs like this:

“It’s funny when people say actors can’t write. Most of ‘em can’t, but look at Woody Allen. Look at W. C. Fields.

“And what is good writing? Even the best writers resemble the best actors. They have a few good projects in them, and the others don’t seem to add up.”

Huh.

No style, no attempt at what Vladimir Nabokov called the enchantment of fiction.

Midway through the book, in a footnote (I love footnotes in fiction, by the way), Franco writes:

“In defense of myself, this is a piece of fiction. I know that my stories might sound like my autobiography, and I am not making much of an effort to hide when I call my character ‘The Actor,’ but isn’t fiction about writing what I know? … At least acting is something I know a little about.”

Well, okay.

So what’s The Actor’s game?

Franco, in Actors Anonymous, does not appear to have or has chosen not to display his narrative gene. Franco is a student of and friends with author David Shields. Shields blurbed the book, calling it “an ambitious and seriously deconstructive fiction.” Shields’ recent books, Reality Hunger (2009) and How Literature Saved My Life (2013) are two literary grenades tossed at the fiction establishment. Shields writes that new fiction should be:

“Collage — in which tiny paragraph-units work together to project a linear motion … collage teaches the reader to understand that the movements of the writer’s mind are intricately entangled with the work’s meaning … are the work’s meaning.”

So, collage — a blurring of nonfiction and fiction but without any attempt at a seduction of the reader. Actors Anonymous — it’s one big, whiny, slapdash “dig me!” Franco, it is apparent, has tried valiantly to implement Shields’ make-it-new approach, tell something of his innermost story. Ambitious, yes. But a failure.

I’d rather listen to a Barry Manilow record."
Actors Anonymous,Just a Girl Fighting Censorship,"June 25, 2015",2.0,"So this was weird. Going into this I had a pretty ambivalent attitude towards James Franco and after reading this book I kind of still do. I don't really know what to make of this very odd book or the man who wrote it.

Is it the ramblings of a madman?



Is it a monument to narcissism?



Is it a desperate plea for attention?



Is it a pretentious manifesto?



Is it good?



I honestly don't know if this was good because I'm still trying to understand the intent. There are moments when Franco is so unbelievably pretentious telling the reader about 'real' art, but am I supposed to take this seriously, is he being ironic? Cause I mean lets be real here, this is the guy that made and .

There are several short stories where he writes about himself in the third person which is really strange. The most disturbing had to be the short story about a girl (who sounds just like all of the male characters) who hooks up with James Franco. That's right, Franco, in great detail, literally sleeps with himself. I'm pretty sure that is like the definition of narcissism.

Setting aside all of the ostentatious references to films he starred in and using the title 'The Actor' as a stand in for his own name, there are stories that are complete fiction. These range from slightly interesting to WTF. All of Franco's characters are pretty much the same. They all talk the same and they even make all of the same references. If I had to hear about Marlon Brando or Jack Nicholson or James Dean one more time... To make his characters interesting Franco does pretty much one of two things. He either makes them drug addicts or sex fiends or both.

Still Franco's writing isn't terrible and there was a story or two that felt well crafted and held my attention, but then there would be some strange essay or open letter filled with name dropping and addressing his public PR issues. It was all very distracting. It seems pretty clear that James Franco thinks very highly of James Franco. This mentality can get trying but, to the benefit of the reader, it is tainted with a certain level of .

Overall, this was just a bit of a mess. I suggest reading this if you love train wrecks or if you, like the author, have deluded yourself into believing you are a misunderstood intellectual."
Actors Anonymous,kelly,"December 29, 2013",1.0,"Holy shit, this was bad...

Jesus, where do I start?

This book calls itself a novel, but it isn't. Not even close. It is a collection of short stories, Franco's ramblings about the film industry, scripts, and bad poetry--loosely based around the concept of the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. This could have been a nice book (there are mixed media, untraditional novels that pull themselves together quite nicely--i.e., Jennifer Egan's Visit from the Goon Squad) but Actors Anonymous is a mess. There really is no central plot or characters, and Franco never really pulls it all together to create a meaningful, cohesive storyline. Each narrator here is some version of a complete loser and sounds exactly the same as the last. And I could have banged my head against my table when I saw a whole chapter of god-awful poetry dedicated to River Phoenix. Was he really serious? God, I pray he wasn't...

And even after the last bomb that was ""Palo Alto,"" I am displeased to announce that Mr. Franco has still NOT figured out how to write. In Actors Anonymous, we get to read such gems as:

""The seduction of the Virgin was as smooth as a bullet through birthday cake.""

""He was part Swedish or something. He made me think of candy canes stuck in people's asses, and gray rooms where people said nothing but inanities.""

Which brings me to another problem with this book: Franco's characters all throughout this book are mostly male. They are shallow, sex crazed, homophobic, and women seem to only enter the narrative when there is some kind of casual sex with a male character. The business-as-usual way that he describes how one of his main characters rapes a woman is truly disturbing. I could see his using such characters to, let's say, make a point about how such behavior is unacceptable, but this never happens in Actors Anonymous. Matter of fact, nothing significant ever happens in Actors Anonymous. There is no character development, no emotion, no depth, and it sucks to read.

I checked this out (along with its equally shitty counterpart, ""Palo Alto"") at my local library, so, other than several hours of my life, I lost nothing here. I would implore other readers to stay as far, far away from this book as possible."
Actors Anonymous,Ryan Field,"November 23, 2013",5.0,"I finished this novel last night and figured I'd better post a review while it's still fresh in my mind. And that's because in many ways it reminds me of a graduate course I took senior year in college called Communications and Literature. I was supposed to take this lame senior seminar as a requirement, but with a little foot work and a really cool advisor in the fine arts department who had some national fame at the time (and signed anything I asked him to sign because he knew how hard I worked in his sculpture classes) I figured out a way to bypass the senior seminar and take a graduate course that focused on literature, interpretation, and communications.

The course was so intense the professor admitted on the first day he didn't get it either, especially the semiotics and semantics. And the reason I'm even mentioning this now is because while I was reading Actors Anonymous I felt as if I'd been transported back to that graduate course all over again. Actors Anonymous, like the graduate course, is the kind of book that needs to be absorbed a certain way, and parsed with an articulate eye. So far, in reading most of the mainstream so-called professional reviews I haven't seen anyone do that with Actors Anonymous. I'm not talking about Amazon or GR reviews now. I highly respect all customer/GR reviews and everyone has an opinion I respect. I'm only talking about people who get paid to write reviews for mainstream publications, and who should know better. Unfortunately, I guess they didn't take any grad courses in communications and literature.

One aspect of communications and literature I learned about in the grad course I mentioned above is that we tend to interpret literature differently at various times in our lives. In other words, I might feel completely different about Actors Anonymous ten years from now if I reread it again in the future. If you don't believe me, revisit a novel you read ten years ago and see if you feel the same way about it. As our lives and circumstances change through the years, we often tend to interpret the books we read in different ways. For me, at this point in my life, I think I appreciated Actors Anonymous as much as I did because as a career fiction writer I understood what was written on the page, and also what was written between the lines of the pages. I probably wouldn't have felt this way ten years ago.

Due to the fact that Actors Anonymous is so abstract at times I can't get into a full plot description because the novel doesn't really follow the normal course of novel writing. I have no doubt it's fiction for the most part. And yet it's not an anthology, and I should know because I've been in far more anthologies than I can even count at this point. What I thought it did was follow a theme that revolves around acting, the deep need to act almost to the point of addiction, and all the traps that accompany fame and fortune if an actor is successful. And it's done in a current (and simple) way that I think is about as real as any novel I've ever read before. If there were a genre labeled ""Reality Fiction,"" this would be a perfect fit. There's no proverbial sugar-coating deal going on here, and in the same respect it wasn't too over the top in a way I might have questioned.

The book does bounce at times from chapter to chapter, which I thought added more abstract appeal. There's a chapter with texts discussing a realtor who boasts about things like her glorious adventures to her deep desire for what I thought was supposed to be interpreted as affection. I could be wrong about that, but it was an interesting chapter anyway. And it's really the way a reader interprets the chapter that matters most. And then there are chapters like McDonalds I and McDonalds II where an unusual guy who seems to drift with the breeze tries to pull his life together by working in fast food and making a few extra bucks on the side by performing sexual favors for some poor unfortunate who's not going to get laid any other way. In fact, throughout the novel I found many well written sex scenes. But they aren't sex scenes that are designed to stimulate the reader in a sexual way. Most are raw, they devolve into the darker side of life most struggling artists experience at one point or another, and they often left me wanting to shower (or rinse my mouth with peroxide). However, the fact that they had this brand of clarity only made the novel more intense for me and the overall reading experience.

If I had begun a book like this and found the writing overdone or poorly executed I probably wouldn't have finished. Thankfully, none of the characters ""barked,"" in the dialogue tags and no one's ""feet climbed up the stairs."" However, the word economy, the exact way each sentence flows into another, and the structure of the narrative kept me turning each page into the early hours of the several mornings. I would love to have seen the original manuscript without revises just to compare it with the final book. It's been so well edited and made so tight I couldn't find one single flaw with the writing. Even the sex scenes worked, and scenes like this in other novels I've read tend to be over-written many times. But not once during a single sex scene did I read a sentence like, ""He brought her off."" This might sound like a minor detail to many people. But if you read a lot and you know the difference, it's a huge thing for others.

Whether or not this novel was written to be sarcastic at times could be anyone's guess. I did detect a hint of snark and WTF-ery in an amusing way (Perez Hilton: smile), but it's not the first time I've seen that in fiction of this nature and I'm sure it won't be the last. The voice in a general sense kept me reading, even during a few of the bumpy sections where I had to go back and figure out what had happened. For me, that was fun. I have eclectic taste and I like reading abstract works that challenge the norm every once in a while just as much as I sometimes like reading Debbie Macomber. I've already recommended Actors Anonymous to people whom I think will like it as much as I did (or get something out of it), and I've cautioned a few who I know would expect something else. As a writer, the one biggest fear I've always had was getting nothing but three star mediocre reviews. Because the books that get the most balanced reviews between one star and five always seem to be the most challenging to the reader. They touched a nerve, they made someone think, and whether they pissed someone off or thrilled someone else, the extreme is always what matters most in the end in fiction.

My suggestion to anyone vetting this book for purchase would be to check out all the reviews and read the samples. My warning would be to beware of all the so-called professional mainstream reviews that talk more about the author and the author's fame than the actual contents of the book.

I purchased the book in digital format on Amazon for 5.99.

Side note: I think you can retrieve your iTunes if your drive crashes. (It's in the book.)"
Actors Anonymous,Ben,"January 9, 2014",1.0,"I like and respect James Franco and really wanted to like this book. But in the end I had to agree with Franco's blunt, self-critical analysis: ""James, I am going to be as frank as I can be: Stop writing. You don't have the facility for it. You have the love, but not the skill. As I have said innumerable times, you throw in a lot of flash, to hide a lack of substance. I think this comes from your deep fear that readers won't accept you as an actor and a writer.""

Authors usually aren't this self-aware or self-deprecating. But in the end, James chose to disregard his own advice and publish the novel - which isn't a novel really, but a series of disconnected, pretentious ramblings about the craft of acting that read like they were dictated by Entourage's Vincent Chase after a long night of cocaine and supermodel sex."
Actors Anonymous,Jake,"October 11, 2013",4.0,"I won this book from a Goodreads giveaway. From the beginning I tried to forget that James Franco is an actor and judge the book just on the writing, but that wasn't possible. Franco didn't let me forget that it was written by ""The Actor"" as he kept popping up in first and third person. The book read like a short story collection. Some of it was really good. Some of it was pretty bad. But, overall I enjoyed it more than I've enjoyed recent books by Chuck Palahniuk. It's worth a read if you aren't easily offended."
Actors Anonymous,Paul,"October 30, 2013",,"For one thing, I doubt very highly that this book was copyedited (I doubt it was edited at all—not by Franco himself nor by anyone else. None of the writing surpasses the quality or feel of first-draft material.) It’s a bad sign when a novel’s first sentence exhibits bad grammar (“We of Actors Anonymous are more than fifty men and women who…”), and we’re treated to at least one more misstep before graduating to page two. Aside from bad grammar, though, which is borderline rampant, strange formatting issues surface; Franco ends a chapter by quoting from Mamet’s , and several of the apostrophes are set as straight quotes (or tick marks), which I can take only as a sign that the author copied the dialogue from the Internet and pasted it into his manuscript. Hardly the novel’s biggest faux pas, but nonetheless embarrassing.

Though is billed as a novel, it’s really just a disorganized scrapbook. E-mail conversations and text messages; multiple collections of vapid one-liners masquerading as philosophical/practical advice for would-be actors; an OMG-is-it-real-or-is-it-fake letter to Franco’s NYU classmates; a few horrendous poems; disorderly, multicolored, Danielewskiesque collections of typefaces (coming off as more vapid and shallow than Mark Danielewski may be Franco’s one accomplishment here); and an unfortunate rant against “” () magazine give the novel the feel of a motley collection of files recovered from a crashed hard drive. Franco has created an AA-esque twelve-step program (from which the novel takes its name) meant to tie everything together, but the contents of the chapters have nothing to do with the twelve Steps or Traditions that give them their titles. In any case, by the time you get to a section of actual narrative, you’re so relieved that you almost believe that the writing maybe actually kind of isn’t really all that bad. Actually, though, it is.

A short introduction precedes the aforementioned / chapter, wherein Franco invites his readers with the eloquence of a third grader to “Make what sense of it that you can.” Elsewhere, the author muses, “And I think you could say that I probably wouldn’t have been involved in everything bad that happened after if I hadn’t been in [that film].” There’s absolutely no attention paid to syntax or to structure, or to the fact that it takes two or three reads to parse this sentence, which in any case holds no real meaning, reveals nothing, and doesn’t serve the story. Franco’s dialogue is downright laughable:
“Give me his fucking number, or . . . I am going to have your new place shut down for serving minors and cocaine use and for being a fucking whorehouse!”
“Jesus, Marc. What is your problem? I’ve never heard you like this, except when you were on coke.”

Franco’s attempt to create a heterogeneous or polyphonic novel is undermined by his patent inability to instill in any of his characters a unique voice. Every man, woman, and teen exhibits the same bored, alienated, pseudo–Holden Caulfield bloviation that’s been done countless times before and to far greater effect (which is to say to any effect at all). We’ve all read Bret Easton Ellis’s sordid tales of disaffected youth in LA, we’ve all read , we’ve all read . Compounding the problem is the fact that ’s characters fail to exhibit any shred of intelligence or intellect, as does the writing itself; if we didn’t all know who James Franco was, we might think that this novel was written by a seventh grader with a decent thesaurus app. Indeed, the book’s themes and concerns rarely transcend those of a junior-high classroom: Who’s hot, who’s not, who’s cool, who’s lame, who hates who, who’s a bitch, who wants to fart or to shit in whose face. (This is excepting, of course, the rape, the men’s-stall blow jobs, and the sex and the sex and the sex.)

An example of Franco’s ineptitude with voice: In one story, a young man recalls his nights spent staring at the cobwebs in the corner of his room where “the ceiling slanted up to a peak and made a crotch” (more junior-high prurience). “As I slept, [the spiders] probably crawled all over me and in my mouth, but I didn’t kill ‘em. More would just come.” (Ignore the fact that this assertion is completely nonsensical, that the character’s claim to have consciously refrained from killing the spiders (while sleeping) after only that they “probably” crawled in his mouth is ridiculous.) The character’s anomalous and intrusive colloquial “‘em” never reappears in his or any other section of the novel—it’s just a flight of first-draft Franco fancy.

As in Franco’s story collection, , ’s characters are never described beyond whether they’re hot, or pretty, or ugly, or sort of pretty, or not very pretty, or maybe just okay looking. Occasionally we learn that a character looks like James Dean or Corey Feldman. It’s all image, and it’s all sex. One female character is “very comfortable showing [her] tits,” since they’re “perfect tits,” but is “shy about [her] pussy,” because she’s “afraid it smells.” (All her words.) Franco informs us later, in one of the novel’s five collections of insipid one-liners, that “Some people smell when you bend them over.” Thanks, James.

In the real world, two years before the publication of , James Franco’s bare ass appeared on the cover of magazine. In the chapter titled “The Account,” Franco the author gives us an “unpublished article,” ostensibly written by an editor at “” Magazine (’s surrogate) about how difficult it was to work with Franco the celebrity. There are footnotes, too, which are meant to have been written by Franco (deemed, in blue, “The Actor”). At a certain point in the eleven pages this disaster comprises, the actual letter ends. “It was torn. It’s quite possible that The Actor ripped it in anger, if he is in fact the annotator,” some third-party italics explain. Yet the footnotes, somehow, remain. And so we’re treated to another seven pages of vapid, petulant, seventh-grade vitriolic “motherfucker”s and “shithead”s and “Duh”s and “fucking retarded”s, not to mention James Franco’s collegiate resume with the proper nouns omitted. It is without doubt the book’s low point, not only because of the language (which is juvenile beyond the vulgarity), and not only because the premise is both fatuous and gratuitous (Franco seems to think that his readers will be interested above all else in which sections of his novel are fictional and which are real-life snippets from his real life; the problem is, fiction or nonfiction, not a page of the novel is interesting), but mostly because Franco, whether it’s Franco the author, Franco the character, or Franco the celebrity, comes off as hateful to the point of absolute tedium.

This is a numbingly stupid book that concerns itself only with vacuous, juvenile, and well-trod banality. “Every actor says he wants to work with Scorsese,” Franco claims in another one-liner. “But why are we all sitting around waiting for Scorsese? Why not be your own Scorsese? And even if you can’t make movies like him, the power of creation is enough. If you work on your own projects, the projects you believe in, then you have the power of making a Scorsese film.” What Franco seems eternally ignorant of is that, obviously, not everyone can be his own Scorsese. It takes more to create art than just believing in one’s self—yes, it takes effort, but it also takes talent. Simply sitting down and typing (or copy/pasting) 300 pages does not produce a novel. The obvious temptation is to call a tale told by an idiot, though I’m reluctant to do so only because it’s not a tale at all—it’s just a mess."
Actors Anonymous,Lukáš Palán,"February 16, 2018",1.0,"Just because you don't know me doesn't mean you don't know me!

Toto je jedna z prvních vět knihy a Franco tak naznačuje, že svůj surrealistický styl ""jsem herec, tak budu i spisovatel,"" vypiloval k dokonalosti. V Palo Altu to ještě byla docela švanda, teď už to bylo ale vážně fyzické utrpení.

Jako Palo Alto, i Actors Anonymous je slepenec přiblblých povídek, jehož hlavním hrdinou je vždy nějaký dement, který dělá dementní věci, většinou obklopenem dementními lidmi, které když dodementuje, tak se nic nestane. Jelikož se to Jamesovi zdálo málo přidal i dlouhou báseň o mrtvém herci Riveru Phoenixovi a musím říct, že větší nesmysl jsem v životě nečetl a to mám poctivě načtené všechny WC Ducky v maďarštině.

Úplným vrcholem knihy pro mě potom byla povídka, ve které James Franco píše z pohledu mladé herečky (I’m shy of my pussy. I’m afraid it smells. It doesn’t, and it’s not an ugly pussy, but I’m still shy of it), která je zamilovaná do Jamese Franca, protože je génius a bůh a on ji nakonec oprcá. Jako, jak velký koule musíte mít napsat takovouhle věc? Já bych si tedy připadal jako úplný debil po jednom slovu. Kurt Cobain is my god. He is the most beautiful man that ever lived. Except maybe James Franco.

LOL, ježiš marja.

Na závěr připojuji část biografie Rivera Phoenixe, která je na čsfd. Při rešerši jsem tam totiž narazil na dalšího velkého spisovatele, uživatele Ivana Kučeru, který vykouzlil odstavec, u kterého jsem málem spadl ze židle:

V INTERVIEW S UPÍROM mal hrať - ako už názov čo to napovedá - novinára, ktorý robí rozhovor s chlapíkom, tvrdiacim, že je niekoľko sto rokov starý upír. Rolu ale napokon obsadil Christian Slater. Nie snáď, že by River z projektu zdupkal, to nebol jeho štýl. Ale nedávno oslávil 23. narodeniny, práve bol Halloween, Predvečer Sviatku Všetkých svätých a médiám a bulváru spravil predčasné Vianoce. Daroval im smrť. Tú svoju. Umrel na predávkovanie drog na špinavom chodníku pred nočným klubom Viper Room. Nepomohlo ani volanie na tiesňovú linku jeho o štyri roky mladšieho brata Joaquina (vtedy sa ešte volal Leaf), vďaka ktorého očiam s nami River zostane navždy; Leaf (vlastne už Joaquin) je talentovaný herec, zdá sa, že nás to s ním tak skoro neprestane baviť a ani jeho s nami. Bolo by zaujímavé sledovať, ako by sa ich kariéry vyvíjali a aké by to bolo, keby sa raz stretli v spoločnom filme. A keby padali z neba milióny, všetci by sme boli veľmi bohatí ľudia.


Daroval im smrť. Tú svoju. hahahahahaha, zabte mě. PROBOHA JEŽIŠI KRISTE"
Actors Anonymous,Eduard,"January 16, 2016",1.0,"Actors Anonymous: More Nonfiction than fiction. Should be called James Franco streams of consciousness rants. I couldn’t wait to complete this “book” and remove it from my Nook. I suppose if you are a superfan of Franco then this book is worth reading. More like a primer for wannabe actors for insight into the self-absorbed acting mentality and psychology. Franco is egotistical and brags about all the women he bedded due to his fame (90% of ""book""). Every other sentence says how “handsome” the “actor” i.e. Franco is (if he does say so himself). Beyond arrogant and stupid autobiographical nonsense. This is hardly a book. Certainly NOT a book of short stories. There were maybe 2 notable short stories here. The remainder of the book is Franco yapping about how great (he thinks) he is and his self absorption. An insight for the stupid acting mentality I would say than a book or stories with plots. Ok to see what type of people actors are (self loathing mentally unstable insecure). Just quips and thoughts of Franco. This isn’t a book. Book should be called “James Franco: my ego and thoughts on acting”. This is what the book is (which is fine) but don’t expect more. Somewhat insightful into the actors egotistical mentality. Thank God I got the ebook for free so when I deleted it I felt relief. I’m embarrassed to say I read this POS. I shouldn't have expected more from an actor."
Actors Anonymous,Jenelle,"February 7, 2014",1.0,I feel dumber for having read this book. Seriously.
Actors Anonymous,J. Lynn,"June 18, 2015",2.0,No. Just no.
Actors Anonymous,Nicole,"March 14, 2014",3.0,"I tried to avoid reading reviews before reading this book because I wanted to go into it with a blank slate, but I couldn’t help reading all the GoodRead reviews. Even after reading bad reviews I decided to give him a chance. There’s no doubt Franco has a talent writing but, like quite a few writers, there are some things he needs to work on.

Most of the characters were extremely unlikable and have something to do with addiction. I felt a lot of the stories were redundant and this is definitely not a novel, but a collection of short stories. Near the end you realize the stories weave into each other through characters, plot, and key events. So they’re not completely random, like some reviews claim.

I liked his writing (he’s not as bad at Meyers but is no Rowling), everything flowed nicely and seemed to go somewhere (most of the time). It’s hard to put a finger on what I liked about it. I guess an “inside look” into what most perceive as a glamourous world is what makes this book so intriguing. It is a fictional novel, though references of real actors/films/events are inserted throughout the book. It makes me feel like most is based on fact while staying true to the “Anonymous” part of the story. And I’m assuming the “actors” gave their stories to Franco since he is referenced quite a few time making the reader quite confused.

It was a fun read. I won’t reread it but it was definitely entertaining. Just like James Franco and lots of actors, there is something about the book which makes it likeable…even if you don’t know what it is."
Actors Anonymous,Sandy,"November 20, 2013",4.0,"This book is unlike anything that I've read before. It's quite original, and for that, I give props to Franco. Although loosely based on Alcoholics Anonymous 12 steps to recovery, this book is presented in a compilation of the typical book format, as well as essays, poems, short stories, footnotes, etc. I particularly like the footnotes section where the writing is in the present tense and talks of what is happening, while the footnotes take place after the death of The Actor, and are that person's view of the events. Furthermore, Franco manages to transition between, and intermingle crude, profane language and an eloquent narrative. Although I do not think this book has a lot of plot, it is informative, interesting, and extremely unique. Some may not like his style of writing but I personally think it is quite insightful and nice.

This book has received a lot of bad reviews, most people are saying that had he not been famous, it would not have been published. I completely disagree. Had he not been famous I probably would not have read it, but I sure am glad I did.

Furthermore, you may be more inclined to read this if you have a fascination with movies, theatre, and TV, as I do."
Actors Anonymous,Cindy Knoke,"November 6, 2013",1.0,"It is hard to imagine this book ever being published if the author wasn't a famous actor.
That also appears to be the focus and theme of this ""tome-ette"", the fact that the author is a famous actor.
It cannot in all accuracy be referred to as a novel. It is more a series of loosely constructed vignettes, much like one might encounter in a cheesy acting class. Incidentally and unsurprisingly, there is a fair amount of cheesy acting class vignettes in this novelette. Let's call it a novelette, written by an authorette and we might be on to something.
The novelette is sleazy and full of depressingly sophomoric sex scenes. The authorette is not without glimmers of talent though despite these formidable limitations.
I have no idea if he could actually write a novel, but I know for certain this is not one.
Why bother? Unless of course, your onboard an airplane and your only other choice is a cheesy movie or People magazine.
That's my excuse. Plus sometimes I just like to read crappy stuff. You may have higher literary aspirations than I do.
Good for you."
Actors Anonymous,George Ilsley,"April 13, 2022",2.0,"Parts of this mess are actually quite good. The premise is interesting, and might have been made into a decent experimental short story. But as a novel? Any novel where you can skip entire sections without losing anything is not really working.

The elements which referred to real life James Franco (such as references to 127 Hours) were a distraction and served to deflate rather than elevate the narrative import. One infers that Franco here is playing with ""celebrity as fiction"" and ""acting is something we all do"" and so on, but the fact is, if this was not a book by the famous James Franco it would never have been published — not without another rewrite or two."
Actors Anonymous,Julia Tulloh Harper,"September 12, 2017",1.0,"DNF.
Tbh I'm not really even sure why I picked this one up. It was like reading an attempt at a creative writing assessment by a first year uni student who just discovered critical theory and now thinks they understand the universe. Except it was written by a famous rich artist (and *PhD* student) in his late 30s who should know better. The self-congratulation dripping from this text was pretty frustrating - I'm not even sure if he was trying to be satirical/ironic half the time or if he just wasn't self-aware at all. Don't read this, anyone. Instead watch the old Spiderman films and remember Franco in the golden years of his youth."
Actors Anonymous,Marie,"November 10, 2013",2.0,"Okay, so I’m giving this book two stars, and although I have pretty much given up on writing extended reviews, I will, for this one, to explain this star rating to anyone who happens to stumble upon this account.

I’m going to admit that I read this book for the lols. My friend loaned it to me, with the River Phoenix poems as the hook. The four poems, three from the perspective of Franco and one from the perspective of Phoenix (written by Franco, obviously), were not good, although I wasn’t expecting them to be. I mean, I was reading the book specifically because I thought they would be terrible. But in comparison to the rest of the book (which was, for the most part, technically well done), the poems lacked any sort of technical poetic skill.

Also, there is that element of self-indulgence. Franco writes to his idol, Phoenix, about how great he is, and Phoenix responds with how pure he is and how inconsequential Franco is in comparison, which is just a reflection on Franco, and has nothing at all to do with putting himself in the mindset of Phoenix.

There are other noteworthy lols. Franco writes from the perspective of a girl who loses her virginity to him, which leads her to feel deeply connected to him, despite her recognising that “he took a lot of girls’ virginities”. Then the first of what I would call “footnote stories”, begins with a guy looking at a picture of a butt of “the Actor”, trying to decide whether the butt is straight or gay, and eventually deciding that the butt wants to fart in his face. There is actually quite a bit of butt/fart/shit stories throughout the book, but the butt photo really is Franco’s magnum opus of butt stories.

These were the things I read the book for. They were for the frivolous joy attained by reading the vainglorious pseudo avant-garde writings of a self-obsessed actor, who feels today’s acting scene is like the beat generation. Based on these stories alone, I would have given the book five stars, because it fulfilled its purpose for me. I’m also going to state again that the writing was much better than I was expecting, which only added to the joy of reading about a butt picture trying to fart in someone’s face. And if I had been pleasantly surprised by a greatly moving story about the lives of young actors in Hollywood, it would have just been gravy.

Now to explain the lowly, two star score:

I don’t usually deduct merit points from a book just because it’s told from a mostly male perspective. People write what they know, and I can understand that a writer may not feel confident, or like they would be able to do the character justice, if they wrote from the perspective of a different sex.

That being said, the male characters in the book are all just appalling creatures. Their masculinity is demonstrated in violence, and reducing female characters’ worth to their level of attractiveness and value as a sex object. It’s pretty much my nightmare of what some guys actually may actually think or feel about women. This is best demonstrated by the underlying rape storyline of the Angel/Casey*.

The first mention of the rape is in the fifth section, when a college guy, Ben, is making out with an unnamed girl. When she passes out, he just decides to have sex with her. Later in the section, he tells an acting teacher about it in an attempt to show he’s had enough life experience to get in the class.

In the fifteenth section, the rape is brought up again, the victim given the pseudonym of “the Angel”, who is in a relationship with “the Actor”. After finding out, two years later, the Angel was raped, the Actor struggles with his masculinity. He sends someone to go attack Ben, but this is obviously not enough, and he decides in order to restore his feelings of sexual potency, he needs to sleep with every girl, including the Angel’s sister, “the Virgin”. There is also a reader in the story, who sums up the situation as follows:



While there’s no doubt that, in reality, rape can affect not only the victim, but the people connected to the victim, the interpretation that the women’s rape is too cliché, while the male artist’s reaction to it is something worth empathy and understanding, is highly offensive. It gets worse later, in the nineteenth section, when one of the characters, Thomas, explains the relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Casey*:



Perhaps, one could argue that Franco is making an intentional statement. Yes, the characters treat women as sex objects and blame rape victims, which demonstrates the vacuous, misogynistic elements of our culture. But is that an intentional element? Is the book attempting to point out societal moral flaws? If it was, it was not demonstrated clear enough. I can imagine the young, aspiringly vain reading this book and relating its themes to their actual thought processes, without it actually challenging them. And that scares me.

So, to sum, I got exactly what I wanted from the book. But I also got something much worse.

*I assume that Casey is the Angel, and Thomas is the actor, though it possibly may not be, however I am connecting them together as whether or not they are connected, it still demonstrates my point."
Actors Anonymous,Colleen Wainwright,"February 5, 2014",2.0,"So sharp and incisive in places it's maddening how sloppy and slapdash it is throughout. Here's an insider who gives a shit and can write. Go ahead: hate on the dude. He can write. Apparently, like latter-day Stephen King (who can, whether you like his quirky, colloquial style or not, also write), no one is willing to edit him. At least, that's my best guess as to the highly uneven but ultimately disappointing collection of thoughts/stories/rants contained herein.

Me? I love stories about people who use (drugs, alcohol, fame, work) to fill the hole inside. And here's someone who has dabbled heavily enough in all of these areas *and* recovered sufficiently from the dabbling *and* has an artistic, searcher's spirit to make a go at sharing how devastatingly ineffective these things are at fixing anything AND CAN WRITE, yet for whatever reason has decided that shipping a first draft is good enough.

Dude is busy. I get it. He's squeezing out books between things. Unfortunately, it looks like the things in question are his perfectly sculpted ass cheeks. What infuriates me above all—in myself, in society, in exes (talk about being able to write a book!)—is wasted potential. Here's hoping he gets a chance to meet his before burning out on multiple activities."

Reseña Original Junio, 2014





No me gusta decir que alguien es ; odio usar el adjetivo porque , sinceramente , creo que todos tenemos algo de pretension en nosotros ... es decir , todos , en algun nivel , (obviamente me incluyo) . Lo somos hasta tal punto que a veces es dificil darse cuenta .Es mas , hasta diria que es un punto gris e incluso llegaria a dudar de la existencia de tal cualidad .

La pretension , supongo , estaria (vieron que pretentious que soy , la cito en ingles y ni se si esta bien escrita o no). Es una opinion , una vision totalmente subjetiva sobre un tercero . A veces tiene mas que ver con la pretenC/Siosidad (de nuevo , las faltas oooorto-graficas me pueden) de uno mismo el juzgar a otros de serlo ; o sea , se me viene a la cabeza a un estudiante de arte en tercer año juzgando de semejante cualidad a uno de primero por ser fan de Dali sin darse cuenta de que uno de cuarto esta simultaneamente juzgandolo a el como tal por expresar semejante opinion ; incluso me encuentro a mi misma diciendo que las novelas de John Green son pretenciosas y sabiendo que , al mismo tiempo , alguien va a estar pensando que pretenciosa que soy yo por decir eso .

¿Me hago entender? ¿O acaso destilo ?

Lo que digo es esto : calificar a alguien de pretencioso es puramente subjetivo , tiene que ver con las opiniones de cada quien ...

Salvo cuando es tan obvia que da asco .

Como es el caso de esta coleccion de JAMES FRANCO .


Maldito pretencioso .

Y decir eso es quedarse corto . Aspira a ser un William Faulkner y ni siquiera llega a un sencillo Irvine Welsh (a quien, encima , tiene el tupé de criticar ... oh , la humanidad!)

No lean este libro si quieren seguir siendo fans del actor . Yo lo lei y ya no puedo soportar ni verle la cara en una foto ."
Actors Anonymous,David,"October 29, 2014",1.0,"Noodling around in the library the other day, I saw this book by James Franco that I did not remember hearing about, so I picked up: On the cover it said it was a novel, and I wondered why I did not know he'd written a novel. The short stories had gotten so much publicity, I must have been under a rock to miss the kind of fuss a novel would have caused. (NOTE: If this is a novel, then I'm Jane Austen!) When I saw that it claimed to be the 12 Steps and 12 Traditions of Actors Anonymous, that seemed to promise amusement, so I decided to check it out. At first, it seemed mildly amusing, but eventually one of the (hopefully) fictional sections reported the narrator committing date rape, and I was suddenly not amused at all. Foolishly, I kept reading. It only got worse, really, and so I kind of skipped ahead to see if there was anything redeeming at the end, but alas, no. I guess it was called a novel so that he could string together a few random bits of underdeveloped fiction, and the 12-step thing makes a nice cover for throwing in a completely random mish-mash of what may be autobiographical observations, with the safety of ""a novel"" to give deniability to the author, should he wish to avail himself of that out. Anyway, I really wanted to like this, and I am sorry the author made that impossible, but I suspect that being offensive was the whole point, and he simply succeeded better than I would have wished him to. Sigh. Instead of one star, I really should be giving this a grade of minus-one star. Ugh."
Actors Anonymous,Po Po,"January 10, 2014",3.0,"Plenty of name-dropping, too many narratives, and not enough direction. Tried to bring things together, but failed miserably.

There were some funny parts. All of the self-referential megalomaniacal stuff that others found distasteful, I really enjoyed.

I also liked the nuggets of truth that came by surprise every now and again:

""We all have masks. Often, I like to write about young people, because it's a time when they are still sculpting their masks.

When we get older, after years of use, the masks meld with our faces. Yes, there are little tweaks here and there, but the mask is reinforced by response. We wear the mask, and people respond to the mask and the mask becomes us, the outside response from others nails it down tight."" [ p.250]

Good idea to use the 12 steps + 12 traditions of AA, but I found the follow-through sadly lacking. The stories didn't fit with the modified actor steps/traditions.

There was just too much going on. For instance, Tradition 1 [Film is Life] and Tradition 10 [From the Foreword to the Second Edition] were chapters that made me think of fruitcake.

Finally, another food analogy: Actors Anonymous = old granny's casserole in yer face. Throw all the leftovers in, bake at 350, and act offended when the kids and grandkids claim they are full and have already eaten."
Actors Anonymous,Kandace,"October 29, 2013",2.0,"Franco was extremely ambitious in Actors Anonymous. The style ranged from almost-stream-of-conscience snippets to emails, text messages to very well crafted prose. The overall feel of the style was in the vein of Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad. However, Franco was unable to capitalize on the form as Egan did, primarily because there is no story progression. In fact there is very little story at all. To call Actors Anonymous a novel is a gross exaggeration. Instead of a unifying plot, it feels as if this is a collection of loosely connected stories in various forms.

A lot of people give James Franco grief because, let's face it, his myriad ventures do seem quite laughable. Personally, I'm a fan (have you *seen* Pineapple Express? Hilarious!), but Franco fell short here. I applaud his creativity and his fearless play in style and form, but this debut ""novel"" what I would want to represent my long form writing.

Overall Rating: 2.5 stars.

Actors Anonymous,Tito Hammer,"July 27, 2018",1.0,"Two or three interesting, well-written chapters and then a plunge head-long into an abyss of absurd footnotes and chaotic non-literature. If you really MUST read this book, just stop around Chapter 3. In all seriousness, without a doubt, this is the worst book I've ever read. Chop off the last 4-fifths of this ""novel"" and you have, perhaps, a compelling rough draft for the beginnings of a novella (and by ""you"", I mean you are the author and you have yet to graduate high school).

I'm honestly curious how any firm would admit to allowing this crap to be published.

Thank God I borrowed this from the library and did not pay one red cent for it!!"
Actors Anonymous,Wiebke (1book1review),"February 23, 2014",3.0,"This is the first of Franco's books I read and I like the idea and the format. Especially the chapters that feel like total word vomit where he's just saying what's on his mind stream of consciousness style. I also liked the idea of experimenting with different narrations and characters and not following a plot from beginning to end.
Nevertheless it feels a bit long and repetitive at some point and also constructed, especially in the chapters about The Actor.
I'm curious to read more of his books, and see where his writing goes.

I am more eloquent and elaborate in my video review of this book:"
Actors Anonymous,A. R.,"November 8, 2013",3.0,"About halfway through this book went from being ""pretty good for being written by James Franco"" to just plain ""pretty good"". I think the style and concept were fine, but the substance is a little weak--it's a little too self-conscious and Franco is too present in the text. Maybe he's playing with the public's views of him, but I'd really like to see what he could do if he got out of his own way. Maybe some of the cute stuff would get cut and you could focus just on the writing, which is actually pretty damn good.

I have not read Palo Alto, but I will give that a shot now."
Actors Anonymous,Hannah,"April 1, 2017",2.0,"This stream of consciousness-but-with-indents kind of book describes what I'm assuming are autobiographical experiences in Hollywood and the film business in general, starting with acting class (and love) and progressing to job experiences in the business. One chapter is written by a groupie of Franco's who he's slept with, describing their intimate encounters, as well as her feelings. Thrown in are a couple of opinions about actors, directors, and the movie business as a whole, with topics rapidly and randomly changing. A few times he lists names of actors, which was a bit annoying."
Actors Anonymous,Thereadingbell,"February 6, 2020",1.0,I do not even know what I just read. I felt like James Franco went on a ranting rampage about the movie industry. It was not a novel but a book filled with short stories. This book failed in every way possible. Maybe this book is better if you are high on some drugs or drunk as a skunk to get what he is trying to tell the reader. I finished this but it as such a pain to get to the end. I do not like to DNF books but this was that bad. I do not know how a publisher thinks someone ranting about the movie industry is worth publishing when it is just a non cohesive rant fest.

is many things: a book, a published work of writing, something that exists in this universe. But an entertaining story? A good piece of literature? A good use of my time? It is none of those things. I think every single person can agree that no one has ever picked this book up and read it for any other reason than because James Franco wrote it. I've been reading all of Franco's books, and I will say that this one was better than , which is in no way a compliment because is the worst book I've ever read. This book was just tolerable enough to go up a star in rating, but I would rather read this book ten thousand more times than read again. Honestly, I think if I read this book first I would have rated this one star, but I guess that I was just so relieved it wasn't like the last one that in my delirious ass decided this was two-star material.

One thing that I *love* about Franco is that he thinks he's some sort of sex god. He somehow got the idea that every single young girl would love to hook up with him, and it shows in his writing. He literally wrote about someone hooking up with him, and in other chapters he wrote about people obsessing over him and just talked about his general love of young women.

“Or I’m like Santa Clause: Everybody needs a picture sitting on my knee. The ones I don’t mind are the young pretty ones.”

You know, it really makes me feel great knowing that if I met him in real life he would try to hit on me.

I get that the theme of the book was acting, but it felt a bit strange that a super successful actor who got famous in his early twenties was telling these stories of all these failed actors. As someone who wants to go into acting myself, I don't really want to be reminded about how hard of an industry it is to thrive in, and how only a small percentage even make something out of it. Clearly he didn't have to struggle for very long before he became famous. He also spends a lot of time complaining about how ""films aren't good anymore"" and that ""being an actor sucks."" It's like he isn't even grateful for the opportunities given to him, especially when there are so many people (who are genuinely better people than him) who would do anything to be in his place. I'm not saying he can't complain about the downsides of his job, but he never even acknowledged his privilege.

It's also a bit ironic how he tried to make a bit of commentary about the misogyny in the film industry, because he is part of the issue. Between the language he has used time and time again to the MULTIPLE sexual misconduct accusations and law suits against him, Franco even pretending to care about women is a joke.

“Now I know how every actress feels when she has to deal with perverted producers and filmmakers who try to convince her a topless scene is essential to the artistry of the film.”

Considering the fact that you got backlash from multiple people for claiming to support the Me Too movement says enough about your character to tell me you ARE one of the perverted producers in question. And if I ever hear anyone say ""It'S pRoBaBlY sAtIrE"" I will kill them, because it is very much not, even if Franco himself thinks it is.

I will say that there was one chapter that I liked. It wasn't just ok compared to the rest, I actually enjoyed it. And that was the chapter about the kids who performed , in which the main character had a hatred of the boy who played Romeo because he was dating the girl he had a crush on. Now I'm not going to act as if the writing was very good or the storytelling was well done, but I did like the ending.
That actually took me by surprise, and in a good way too. It was exciting, I felt some sort of emotion other than boredom or disgust, and I really wished at least one more chapter could have had an ounce of the excitement that this one had.

On the plus side, there wasn't a worst chapter, but that's because every single one of the rest of them were pitiful. I had pretty much no fun reading this book, and I got nothing out of it. I don't even feel proud that I got through it, because it was just that bad. But on the plus side, I don't have to read any more of Franco's novels, and I can start the painful process of trying to forget this monstrosity. I really hope that none of the actors who Franco compared himself to have read this book, because then they would have to live with the knowledge that James Franco thinks he's as good as any of them. I especially don't want any of River Phoenix's family to read this, because I don't want them to have to stomach to disgrace that is the poetry that Franco wrote. You know, in MGK's new movie, his character is described as being like a modern River Phoenix, and I don't know if that movie line or this poetry is a bigger disgrace to Phoenix's memory.

I'm going to wrap up this review by sharing some of the *best* lines from the book:

“The seduction of the Virgin was as smooth as a bullet through a birthday cake.”

“He was part Swedish or something. He made me think of candy canes stuck in people’s asses, and gray rooms where people said nothing but inanities.”

“I want to be able to show my pussy out loud. But I’m shy of my pussy. I’m afraid it smells. It doesn't, and it’s not an ugly pussy, but I’m still shy of it.”

“...but I for one have never said, when admiring breasts, “Looks at those Granny Smiths!””

“I was ready for that Swiss faggot.”

“There is a bullet hole in the front widow of my parent’s home.” (I want to draw attention to the quite obvious spelling error in this line. It wasn't the only one I came across, and between that and the general bad quality of the book, it lets me know that Franco didn't bother to edit at all.)

To wrap up this review I'm going to share a passage from the book that perfectly sums up how I feel:

“James, I’m going to be as Frank as I can be: Stop writing. You don’t have the facility for it. You have the love, but not the skill. As I have said innumerable times, you throw in a lot of flash, to hide a lack of substance. I think this comes from your deep fear that readers won’t accept you as an author and a writer. Well, if you continue writing about a character called “The Actor,” of course they won't accept you as a writer! You need to either buckle down and learn to tell a story, or just stop writing. This material is like a combination of National Enquirer gossip, MTV-style quick cuts, and experimental fiction schlock. Of course I am a scholar of the English Renaissance, and you could say I know nothing about what is current, but I also know that Shaespeare has been read for 400 years. Can you see this mess being read even two weeks from now?”

Well... at least it was better than Palo Alto."
Actors Anonymous,Freda Mans-Labianca,"July 4, 2018",1.0,"Meh.
I wanted to like this book, I mean, I LOVE James Franco. The premise was pretty interesting too, and unheard of. Still, the book fell flat for me.
It was a fictional book of short stories, it was supposed to be thespians that were not famous yet. Each story was a vignette of how they cycle around acting, tryouts, casting calls and more. Stories from their every day norm, and how they get through life.
I found that almost every story had a sexual side to it, or was about things I felt uncomfortable reading about. I didn't need to know half of what was told, especially who was doing who.
There was a moment where James was telling his story, but being fiction, you quickly realize it's him but he's talking drivel. So I lost interest.
I would enjoy a memoir much more, that's clear. Fiction is not his forte in my opinion. He should stick to acting."
Actors Anonymous,Amy,"July 12, 2018",4.0,"I like this, ok, and don’t understand the low rating. I think it’s fair to take this for a satire, or at least a little tongue in cheek, rather than tasteless self-indulgence. JF doesn’t hide the fact that much of the material is autobiographical (or adapted from real life, which all fiction is), rather he calls himself out to humorous effect. Maybe the themes don’t coalesce perfectly, but they’re there and are entertaining/thoughtful enough.

Also, people who are saying this doesn’t count as a novel because of its unconventional structure would probably have the same bone to pick with Nabokov’s Pale Fire, which is their loss."
Actors Anonymous,Courtney d,"February 11, 2019",5.0,"Still wanting to know is James Franco the ""actor"""
Actors Anonymous,Evin Ashley,"January 5, 2016",5.0,"I am, with hesitation, giving this a book a five - it was a fitting segway from reading about the life of the first Roman emperor Augustus, who remarked on his deathbed, ""If I have played my part well, clap your hands, and dismiss me with applause from the stage.""

I already enjoy Franco's innovative career, and was curious to read what he put to pen. I've also been interested in exploring the psychology of celebrity - how people from all walks of life may be thrust into the spotlight, and how that kind of power transforms them. Understandably, since Franco was an established celebrity before being an author, his writing has received wildly polarized critique. If you often do quick scans of NYT or the Goodreads review section to solidify your opinions - or predetermine them - then you will not be satisfied this time around.

The first hundred or so pages of Actors Anonymous had me enamored; it was like a splendid dive into a pool of emotional exploration after Everett's measured retelling of history. I began thinking, ""Wow, this book could be a five."" But around p. 144, the stories began to stagnate on a depressing, recurring theme of sexual degradation - be it pedophilia, sexual shame and compulsion, rape or prostitution. I began to infer his similarity to another rapacious, contemporary LA author, Bret Easton Ellis - based upon his repeated use of derogatory words about women and sex and the excuses of tortured souls.

On p. 206, at the climax of a story that had been constantly interrupted by and interweaved with footnotes and voices, Franco just seemed blazed out of his mind.

In spite of these major two annoyances, there were so many passages that were wrought with an emotional honesty; a ""truth"" as he likes to put it - and a brave dive into depth of human psyche. It is evident to me and so many readers of the inherent irony of his book's title, ""Actors Anonymous"" - Franco is attempting to shine a light on his multifaceted celebrity; how his art has been shaped by his fame, and how that art has shaped him. His writing is both personal and raw, and universal and detached.

I appreciate Franco's bravery to create in spite of the critics, and his own loudest internal one. I thoroughly enjoyed reading every page of his book; just not the last one with the headshot that seemed to say: ""Yeah, I know you want to give me a five. Give me a five."""
Actors Anonymous,Chloe,"December 30, 2013",1.0,"Nooooooo! I defended Palo Alto with my soul, and I have been let dowwnnnn.
Alright, straight up. The text really only connects with a certain breed of reader - namely, Actors/ movie people. I consider myself a well-to-do movie buff and I could not care about any of the characters. But really, I tried.
It was much easier to emotionally connect with Palo Alto because, who hasn't been an angry teenager? I don't work in the movies, I don't know any actors, so I care very little about the philosophical ramblings of acting, Hollywood and celebrity.
Franco's writing is actually quite good in AA, nothing ground breaking, but he retains a dry simplicity that reads well. The thing that weirded me out was the form... Is this a novel? Parts felt a little self-indulgent, like Franco has taken small interesting things from his career or things he's heard from other actors, dramatized and fictionalize these moments and crafted a story to project an image he wants to be seen as in the public eye. He also takes the luxury of bringing up old dirt the media dished on him, like falling asleep in class, professors being fired etc... this all felt a little tacky, but I understand what he was trying to say about celebrity blah blah blah blah blah - this is the 21st Century, we worship celebrity but we don't CARE about it.
The annoying thing is (and this really frustrates me) you can see Franco has IDEAS, like really good IDEAS, but he can only execute them through what he knows (being young, being an actor) - he actually half-heartedly mentions this in the text. He says he doesn't know anything about sci-fi etc, but he knows about literature. It's okay to write a novel about nothing but a guy walking around (Henry Miller/ Albert Camus/ the entire Beat generation) Hollywood making observations and stating his ideas with minimal plot - and I think to a certain extend, this IS what Franco is trying to do. But he's missing the single dominant character who we identify with and who's ideas we care about - unless that character is the author, but here is where he falls into the self indulgent trap. Poor guy, he would have been better writing an autobiography, or (ironically) publishing this book anonymously."
Actors Anonymous,Tina,"October 16, 2013",3.0,"I received this copy from a giveaway on goodreads.com.

My decision to give 3 stars was very difficult. I mulled over how I would rate and review this book for several days. I enjoyed it, in many parts. In other parts, I wondered if it were a vanity publication.

Reading the first chapter, I continually asked myself if I was reading this book out of obligation; I had won it and owed an honest review. The first chapter read like a writing assignment in college. YET, I did continue to read, and not out of obligation; many of the stories/chapters intrigued me. The last chapter was the only one I had to force myself to complete.

James Franco has written a book that leaves me wondering which parts, if any, are autobiographical and which are purely fiction. I firmly believe that was his goal. There are passages in this book that are painful and glorious in their (for lack of a better word) honesty. As I read I began to compare his writing to Spencer Tracy's acting; it was difficult to tell the part from the person, which is the finest acting of all.

Actor's Anonymous drew me in, as any good book should. The writing is a bit juvenile or amateurish in the first chapter. I don't know if this was a deliberate device. Despite the perceived flaws, I would recommend this book for the parts which shine. I do not regret reading it- something I cannot say for some books I've read. While it won't stay in my home, I will remember it (some scenes may stay in my mind for a very long time) and that is another point in its favor.

If you are a James Franco fan, or someone who enjoys books written by famous actors in the hopes of feeling closer to them and their motivations, this might be entertaining for you. I don't guarantee you will get a better understanding of James Franco, but you may find yourself asking questions about why you should care about someone just because they are in the movies. Perhaps that was his intention in writing this book."
Actors Anonymous,Casey,"February 5, 2014",3.0,"This book really took me back to my writing classes in high school and college. I was tempted to write in a lot of experimental ways back then, and sometimes I did experiment. But as I've grown as a reader and a writer I've come to see that the best writers are usually invisible. The stories speak, but the writer doesn't. Some writers paint poetic images with their words. Sometimes what they do works, and sometimes it really doesn't. I believe that Franco has some talent as a writer (he probably got some good grades in his high school writing classes), but not enough to make a day job out of it. He's lucky enough to pull his audiences in from other means and then experiment freely with his writing.

As a reader, I wondered what was truth, what was fiction, and what was just Franco airing his dirty laundry outright for the court of public opinion. I was curious enough about his world to be drawn into it, but I didn't love it. It was disorganized. It never really came together, and I wondered if the joke was on the reader. Maybe this book is like a creative writing aficionado's version of a selfie that exposes their privates? An artistic and thoughtful butt joke?

For example, he names many calls many characters by their characteristics. There is ""the actor,"" ""diarrhea,"" etc. He also seems to include some e-mails, text messages, etc. verbatim (they may or may not be real messages). As I type this, I hear him reading it in his own voice.

I listened to this book as an audiobook. Some audiobook readers wished they had it in another format. I don't. It seemed right to hear it in his own voice. I feel like I know him much better after reading this book, and I wish him all the best in his future writing endeavors (which I will not be reading)."
Actors Anonymous,Veronica,"June 5, 2014",1.0,"I gave ""Actors Anonymous"" one star, because really, it's brave of James Franco to put material out there to be admired/judged. Criticism is hard, because it's always subjective, and I can't just say, ""I hate it!"" and expect people to go along with me.

...but I HATED this book. I don't agree with the term ""novel."" I'd say it's more a collection of thoughts, short stories and stream of consciousness paragraphs. This in itself isn't a bad thing, but James Franco has the unfortunate ability to insert his persona into every bit of his ""fiction."" His characters are all some form of ""the actor,"" and none of them manage to escape their (his) own self-importance, or experience growth. The narrative weeaves along without plot or point, but the common demoninator in every paragraph, in every page, is this: I am an actor, I am an extremely important artist, and I am misunderstood.

Any females in the book are mentioned purely in relation to their looks, and other characters that wander in are selfish and one-dimensional. Sometimes, James writes as ""James"" and gives us insight into his tortured artist's soul.

I can't decide whether he is really self-aware, and has made a genius-level commentary of his absorbed, self-involved life, or if he's really this clueless and grandiose. Either way, save yourself the effort."
The Almost Moon,Kendra,"February 29, 2008",1.0,"I wanted to believe that the backlash against this book could be explained by general disappointment about Sebold's second novel not living up to The Lovely Bones. Um, yeah. Not only did it not measure up, but I don't even want this book in the same ROOM with my other books. It really and truly is that bad. I tried, people. I tried. But when I spent 4 hours on a plane learning how to do Sodoku just so I wouldn't have to read one more heinous word of this novel, I knew that I was going to have to throw in the towel and say some terrible things about Sebold's latest effort.

We all know she can write. Even when her words are polluting my air, it's obvious she can write. Why she chose to write such this time is just beyond me. The entire book centers around Helen killing her mother. And, you know, that could have been an interesting theme to run with, but Sebold just mangled and butchered it instead. I suspect that maybe I was supposed to feel sorry for Helen, but instead I found her to be thoroughly unpleasant, and I started wishing that she'd go ahead and kill herself, too. After 87 pages, I no longer even cared enough to skim ahead in order to find out what horrible things had happened in her past. In fact, I'm surprised that I ever made it past page 44, which as another reviewer already noted, contains some of the absolute worst lines ever written. No kidding. I don't recommend reading this entire book (obviously), but if you're into brief spurts of masochism, mosey on over to the library and pull this book off the shelf just to read page 44."
The Almost Moon,Laila,"January 30, 2018",4.0,"I should preface this by saying that I have never read a book with an accumulative star rating this low before. It also confirms that star ratings are ridiculous - or maybe that one star ratings are compliments in disguise.

Can someone explain to me why a story has to have likable characters? Why someone who is clearly loosing it should act in a way a sane reader finds believable? I'm pretty sure when I read Fight Club I didn't think I would act that way... but she's a woman, so she has to be in fiction that can be quickly accessed and then resolved with a nice bow on top.

Let me be clear: this book is poisonous. It's hits hard, especially to anyone who understand complicated issues between mothers and daughters. But that's what it's supposed to be, it's supposed to be poisonous, it's supposed to disturb the reader and make us feel bad and I thought it was very well crafted.
To me, the character made perfect sense, and I even liked her as much as that is possible. She did the best she could for a long time and then she snapped and did something she couldn't take back. I thought the book depicted that situation beautifully.

Now, I have thing for Alice Sebold: I thought The Lovely Bones was good and entertaining, but my special interest is in those books that were generally described as disappointing, like Lucky and this one. Maybe her way of seeing the world just makes sense to me, and maybe that doesn't bode that well, but just because she describes the world out of the viewpoint from characters who may not fit exactly in the nice, uplifting story with a bow on top formula so predominant in so-called ""women's fiction"" doesn't mean it's bad writing."
The Almost Moon,Orsodimondo,"September 2, 2022",4.0,"LA FIGLIA OSCURA



Helen Knightly, l’io narrante, esordisce così al primo rigo:
Alla fin fine, ammazzare mia madre mi è venuto facile.

Devo dire che Alice Sebold mi ha abituato a incipit che non si perdono in giri di parole, incipit fulminanti e senza preamboli.




C’è odio nel gesto di Helen. Ma anche amore. E, forse, perfino pietas. Per la madre, e, finalmente, verso se stessa.
L’anziana era una donna bella e affascinante: ora è avvinta dalla demenza senile. È stata una madre poco presente, probabilmente una ‘cattiva madre’, ma forse soprattutto una madre inerme.
Adesso, è stata trasformata dalla malattia in una specie di figlia vecchia. Figlia della sua stessa figlia.

A parte Elettra che uccide la madre Clitennestra (*) nella tragedia di Euripide, il matricidio è molto meno frequentato dalla narrativa del patricidio. C’è voluto Freud, la psicanalisi tutta, perché questo lato del vivere emergesse.
L’essere ‘madre cattiva’, e ‘figlia oscura’, sono conquiste e scoperte della letteratura più recenti. E ancora si fatica ad accettarle, ad accoglierle.
È stata Elena Ferrante nel suo articolo del 2007 per presentare l’ultimo (finora, spero!) romanzo della Sebold, a evidenziare questo aspetto.




Forse perché il legame madre-figlia e figlia-madre è più insondabile di altri, più misterioso. Almeno per la metà maschile del mondo.
O forse non è davvero così tanto più complesso e misterioso, è solo che per orrenda tradizione semi universale il ruolo della donna è più marginale rispetto a quello maschile, e quindi, c’è voluto più tempo e più impegno per scandagliare l’universo femminile.

Ancora oggi, nel terzo millennio, a chi viene attribuito il dovere di sacrificare la propria vita per badare agli altri? Alla donna. Chi è che assume il ruolo di balia e badante? Più spesso, la figlia femmina.
E ora che le conquiste in campo medico fanno sì che la vita (ma non la salute) si sia allungata sempre più, la figlia femmina rischia di arrivare a settant'anni continuando ancora a occuparsi dei genitori. Una gabbia, una prigione per chi non ha un rapporto assolutamente meraviglioso e idilliaco con la madre o il padre (e a quanti capita davvero?).




Non c’è dubbio che Alice Sebold abbia accolto appieno questa apertura del mondo moderno: i suoi romanzi sono tutti viaggi nella psiche femminile. Esperienze strepitose di un mondo altro per me uomo.

Dopo due romanzi nei quali l’io narrante era vittima a tutto tondo e subiva, lo stupro e la violenza nel primo, la violenza e la morte nel secondo, arrivata al terzo romanzo, Sebold racconta una vittima che si ribella e commette il crimine massimo: uccidere la propria madre.
O forse, il crimine massimo è uccidere il proprio figlio/a? E allora, che cosa sarà la tua prossima storia, tenera, ironica, rabbiosa Alice?
A ciascuno il suo dolore.



PS
In un’intervista Alice Sebold ricorda questa storia: la madre della scrittrice Patricia Highsmith bevve acquaragia per abortire. Ovviamente il tentativo fallì. Highsmith finì per scrivere romanzi di rara misantropia. Eppure continuò a prendersi cura della madre fino alla morte, che anticipò di poco la sua.

The Almost Moon,Rhian,"January 21, 2008",1.0,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Bad in every way: terrible sentences, dreadful unbelievable characters, boring story. Includes this line, ""This was not the first time I had been face-to-face with my mother's genitalia."" Her genitalia has a FACE!!!! Downhill from there."
The Almost Moon,Monty,"November 24, 2007",5.0,"I couldn't put this book down so I read it in two days. What I especially liked about the book was how the author used stream of consciousness thinking (flash backs)to explain the thoughts and actions of the main character during a 24 hour period just before and after she kills her demented mother. Also, as unreal as the events seem in the this story, they stem from the main character (who grew up in a disturbed family) making some minor poor choices under stress, then making a major poor choice (she killed her mother) which put her on a path of no return. I think this happens to us all the time, but not on such a major scale. If you haven't read The Lovely Bones, then I recommend that book as well.

NOTE: It's interesting that most people who read or starting reading this book didn't like it. Nevertheless, I think it's a good read."
The Almost Moon,Rita,"May 24, 2008",1.0,"Spoilers...

The subject matter was hard at the start, but it got easier as the book progressed, because I started to really dislike the main character.

Yes, I understand and appreciate the dichotomy of the mother/daughter relationship, especially a dysfunctional one. I get the love/hate thing. I really, really do. But, the fact that she owned her hatred of her mother at such an early age--she acknowledged it and expressed it, I mean she OWNED it, but then she only acted out the ""loving daughter"" part, was so disingenuous. But, if we're to accept that this is who that character was, then she was just weak and sick. And continued to be weak and sick, all through her marriage, hurting her husband and her children all while openly hating the mother that she insisted on caring for, and then finally killing that mother. The character was 49 at the time of the story, and in all those years, from the first spark of hatred of her mother when she was little, did she ever think that this was all unhealthy and wrong? She was closed off, cold, cruel, pushing everyone away, even her children (which I found so hard to read, that she went on and on about her dislike of her older child) and never had any inkling to change? Oh, she saw the one therapist once, who was apparently just as nuts as she was, and talked about her hostility towards his ""probing."" It was all just too weird to accept.

Then her having sex with her best friend's son was even more hard to stomach than her killing her mother. I mean, that feels almost incestuous, doesn't it? The son was grown, and apparently had a crush on this woman for a long time, but still, I don't understand how you can have sex with someone who is the child of your best friend. Someone you've had an adult role in raising since birth. It was, as I said, worse than the murder she'd just committed, IMO. After I realized that I truly did not like this woman, anything about her, it was even harder to plod through her narcissism over her figure (realizing that if she had not taken such good care of her figure she wouldn't have had the strength to murder her mother, nor be attractive to her friend's son--oh GAG me!--and her going on and on about how plump her friend was, in a not-nice way--again, who is SHE to put down anyone!?!)

See, the book wasn't presented as maybe the diary of Charles Manson would be, like it's supposed to be a spectacle of horrors, hard to get through because that level of sickness is just so out of our understanding. It was presented kind of like we were supposed to maybe sympathize with her and root for her. I think she was supposed to come across as weak and having made bad decisions, but ""damaged"" by her upbringing. I think we were supposed to recognize that she made bad choices, but also feel compassion for her because of what she'd gone through, and her conflicting emotions. I didn't though. At first I did. But, then the stuff with the friend's son came in and the stuff about the kind of mother she was, and that she just never even tried to stop wallowing in her own illness. I just thought she was selfish and a horrible person.

The end was mildly redeeming. Yes, she was going to take responsibility for it, finally, and try to repair her broken relationships (from prison, or a mental institution, more likely). But, it was too little too late.

What I truly hated about the book was that it is the opposite of what I like and what I hope to achieve in my own writing. I am all about stories of people who come from sickness and bad luck and through whatever (the unexpected love from others, their own strength, some luck that graces them, assistance from doctors, teachers, mentors), they are able to get out of the muck and make something of themselves. I'm not even talking big like The Persuit of Happyness. Even just little ones like Dead Poets Society, where the big prize is having the courage to ask out a girl, or tell your parents you don't want to be a lawyer. Just to get over the negative weight and live a normal life. I am all about stories of rising above whatever handicaps you were born with or dealt early on. I like to see stories where people were born ""freaks"" and then somehow normalized that title, made it work FOR them, taking what they've been given and gaining strength from it.

This was the opposite of that. This took a person, put her in a bad situation (yes, her childhood was bad, but it wasn't the worst I've seen by any measure) and then held her head under its water until she drowned in it. It took what could have been a quirky person from a less-than-ideal upbringing, spun her around and turned her into a freak, instead of taking a person out of a horrible place and turning her into a hero. I just don't like those kinds of books, I guess. I just had a really, really hard time with this woman's lifetime of submission to weakness and selfishness and felt that there shouldn't even be a book written about this kind of person unless it is clearly stated that we are supposed to genuinely dislike her. And, well, I genuinely dislike plenty of selfish and weak people who have done real-life bad things to me and others, so I just don't want to invest my recreation time to it, too."
The Almost Moon,Ann,"December 5, 2007",3.0,"When I read The Lovely Bones, Alice Sebold’s bestselling first novel, I thought, now what? What does an author write after that? How could she possibly top this novel?

Three short years later Alice follows with a realistic, maybe too real, new novel, The Almost Moon, that promises to ease its way up the bestseller list in a short time. In what seems to be Ms. Sebold’s tradition, The Almost Moon is a dark tale, not a cozy quick read. This story voices some of the worst emotions and fears one could imagine.

Helen Knightly, a middle-aged woman looking after her elderly mother, commits an act that most could not fathom. In the first sentence of the book, Helen tells the reader in her casual voice—as if she were a friend—that killing her mother came easily. This personal point of view sets the tone of the story and somewhat prepares readers for the emotional ride to come. The book only covers a twenty-four-hour period, but because of the way the story is told readers will hardly notice. I must applaud Ms. Sebold for the courage to tackle emotions and thoughts that readers will not want to identify with and a subject that will surely generate plenty of criticism.

The intricate relationship Ms. Sebold weaves between mother and daughter brings to the surface what most families fight to bury in their histories. The unhealthy bond between Helen and her mother Clair is evident when a young Helen eats a whole cookie sheet of candy Clair has made. Helen is punished by having to remain at the kitchen table until her father comes home. She becomes quite ill, but manages to stay in place.

The crazy dance between mother, father, and daughter has a long-lasting effect on Helen’s reality. She helps her father make existence possible for Clair by taking on an adult role with the neighbors and outsiders when Mr. Knightly is out of town. At one point, Mr. Knightly is gone for three months on business, or so says Clair. While he is gone, Helen is greeted with sad nods and casseroles from the neighbors, which she hordes in the deep freeze while mother and daughter live off peanut butter crackers and cheese toast. Helen fears one day she will be responsible for feeding both herself and Clair. She fears her father will never come home.

Sebold reveals a whole set of legacies passed on from one generation to another. Helen grows into a teenager perceiving her family as normal. It’s not until a neighbor points out the mental illness laced through her parents’ actions that Helen feels some freedom and validation. Her feelings about her mother were given a name: insanity.

Clair Knightly is not the most likeable of characters. She came to motherhood late in life only after her lingerie modeling career became nonexistent. The simple detail that Helen grew up in a house where the walls and tabletops were covered with framed black and white photos of Clair wearing lingerie was enough to make me sympathize with Helen, especially as more of the backstory unfolded. But just as I became willing to understand Helen’s act, Helen would say or do something that pushed me away. Whether intentional or not, this distancing was an excellent technique.

I believe every book asks a question of its readers. With Helen’s whole story unfolded, revealed, does this give her the right to take the life of her mother? Is her act a punishable offense, or do readers find something about Helen that helps them hope for her freedom? I’ll leave this for the readers to decide for themselves.

Alice Sebold’s unflinching ability to stare down the everyday violence lurking under the surface deserves both acknowledgment and praise. While this book may bring debate, and is not recommended as a casual read, I strongly suggest The Almost Moon to lovers of writing well done."
The Almost Moon,Leslie,"March 8, 2008",4.0,"This book was extremely disturbing. The main character is introduced as seemly a normal woman whose elderly mother is entering her final years and at the stage of facing a nursing home or care facility. Even after she kills her mother, she tells the story as if this is just sort of a bummer day, almost, ""Oh my gosh, I killed my mother. I don't want to be late for work."" Ironically, I was even lulled into moments where I was not completely horrified at what just happened--and continues to happen through the next 24 hours.

Through the book, we learn about her mother's mental illness, as well as her father's, and we see the domino effect of mental illness.

A lot of people rated this book very low, and I have to admit I had difficulty getting through it. I am a young adult librarian, and I still struggle on whether I want to add it to the collection because it is told in such a real way.

In fact, I have seen women like the main character in the news...i.e. minister's wife kills husband...and I wondered what happened to her to make her do it. This is her story. The slow erosion of rationale thinking due to mental illness and emotional strain. I think it is a very unique book in its perspective and helpful in analyzing the thought processes of the mentally ill, which is why I recommend it."
The Almost Moon,Jade17,"September 13, 2008",1.0,"I made it to around 60 pages before I chucked it across the room. Horrible horrible horrible all over the place, pathetic writing with sad, unlikeable characters."

I freely admit it; that as a man, there are sometimes things that women do that utterly baffle me, and will probably continue to baffle me until the day I freaking die, just like it is with women regarding men. And that's because, avoiding any kind of qualitative judgment, I think we can all agree that there are fundamentally different ways that men and women sometimes react in different situations, based on a variety of criteria and societal concerns, and that in some cases such actions and behaviors can seem incomprehensible to the other gender. You don't hear of too many men, for example, who just lose their marbles one day, drive their kids to a nearby lake and calmly drown them; not too many male jilted lovers go on insane cross-country drives in the middle of the night, with bizarre weapons in tow and while wearing adult diapers so that they don't have to make bathroom breaks, all in the name of some crazed crackpot scheme thought up in the middle of the night regarding stabbing their lover's new lover then turning the knife on themselves.

It is one of these very topics, in fact, that fuels the entire storyline of acclaimed author Alice Sebold's latest brilliantly twisted dark little novel, ; in fact, that's what the very first chapter of the book is devoted to, is a real-time blow-by-blow accounting of a middle-aged woman suddenly going insane one day and murdering her senile, sh-t-covered old-age mother, just randomly one afternoon while over at her house and preparing to clean her like a baby for the thousandth time in a row now. What the rest of this delightfully wicked story is about, then, is a fascinating and detailed look at the decades leading up to this moment, told in a non-narrative ""hyperfiction"" style that jumps from early-childhood to just yesterday at the blink of an eye, painting one of the deepest portraits you'll see in contemporary literature of a dysfunctional mother-daughter relationship, and of all the teeny, tiny, strange, entertaining, depressing, hopeless, fascinating ways the relationship affects the way the woman deals with each and every other person in her life too. It is utterly a female story, the kind that can only be told by a female author, but told in a way so that I as a male reader can get it too; I love such novels, as I've mentioned here before, and am always glad to come upon another one like I have this week.

So why does Sebold's name sound so familiar, you're thinking? Well, because she's the mousy dark novelist who seemingly appeared out of nowhere in the early 2000s to write , an emotionally devastating crime thriller and meditation on loss that happened to have been written from the standpoint of a murdered teenage girl as she watches the proceedings from heaven. I read it too when it first came out, and like many others it made me openly weep in public; it became not only a runaway bestseller, but is also slated to be the next movie by impresario Peter Jackson. Oh yeah, Alice Sebold!

This is only her second novel, after taking a break between them to pen the true rape memoir ; and it is the best kind of second novel to write, to tell you the truth, one that..."
The Almost Moon,Sara (sarawithoutanH),"March 3, 2018",1.0,"Before I start this, let me just say that Alice Sebold’s writing style is not the problem. This is a definite example of how good writing does not always equal a good novel. The writing was compelling enough that I did not DNF this book. But, in my opinion, the plot itself was absurd. I am shocked that this is from the same author who wrote The Lovely Bones. I’ve never read TLB, but I’ve known many people who have cited it as a great book, or even their favorite book. This book feels like it came from a different planet. How can an author who wrote such a critically-acclaimed novel also write this? As Zac Posen would say on Project Runway, the taste level just isn’t there. (I’ve been binging too much PR and I might be the only one to get this reference).

I like to think that novels are stories that authors feel they *need* to tell. I have no clue why anyone would want to tell this story. I’m not against dark stories. In fact, I loooove dark, fucked up stories. But this is just dismal. Helen is a miserable person and the only thing this novel does is confirm that she had a terrible childhood and her mother’s mental illness went untreated her whole life. Her father also suffered from mental illness, but it was skirted around and not as vilified as her mother’s. There’s a point where Helen is confronted with the truth of her father’s illness and she makes a conscious decision to never blame him for anything that has gone wrong in their family, and yet she constantly blames her mother and says she’s always wanted to kill her. It was just confusing. The story is told in a stream of consciousness style, and I just wasn’t really here for it. I really did not like Helen or anything she chose to do, in the past or present.

Also, usually when the main character of a novel murders someone, I kinda want them to get away with it. With Helen, I was was ready to dial 911 myself, if only to end the book. I’m not sure what I was supposed to feel while reading this. Bad for Helen? Bad for Helen’s mom? Bad for the people they both affected? All I really felt was annoyed.

Don’t read this book if you enjoy using your time for productive things. I’m sure you could find a better story that encapsulates a dark family dynamic and how mental illness affects us, personally and as bystanders. Honestly, I *know* you could find a better book with these themes."
The Almost Moon,Caroline,"December 1, 2007",1.0,"This was just not worth the effort it took to get through it, at all. I could have gotten over the main character murdering her mother (which is within the first sentence, so don't panic about being spoiled) if she weren't so unpleasant in every other respect. First she murders her mother, and then she goes on to do other things that are just as cringe-worthy.

I also could have gotten past how horrible a person Helen was...if they novel had any kind of point at all. I kept reading in hopes that it would resolve , and it doesn't. All it does is confirm mental illness and a horrible childhood, all of which is pretty obvious from the first chapter, and that's it.

The writing itself drove me a mad, as well. It's written in more stream-of-consciousness, so the story jumps all over the place because Helen's mind jumps all over the place. One second she'll be narrating how she's panicking over what she did to her mother, and the next she'll be five years old and talking about some important event that happened to make her the way she is now. I can appreciate stream-of-consciousness, but not when it's so disjointed that it confuses me as to what is going on.

Yes, the characters are fleshed out. Yes, Alice Sebold has a great command of the English language and is very poetic at times...but this was just awful.

After I read the last page (which made the whole thing feel like there was point, what with the lack of resolution and all), I felt mentally ill for reading the whole thing."
The Almost Moon,Carin,"June 28, 2008",4.0,"Sebold has a gift for poetic tone and thoughtful metaphor. I love how you're just toodling along, reading away, and suddenly, BAM! she hits you with something like: ""She looked up at me and smiled. 'Bitch,' she said. The thing about dementia is that sometimes you feel like the afflicted person has a trip wire to the truth, as if they can see beneath the skin you hide in.""
Or: ""I got her standing with ease, but once she was upright, she collapsed in my arms. It was all I could do not to drop her, bringing both of us to the ground. As I adapted to the balance of holding her full weight, I could not help but think of my father, how year after year he carried the burden of her, apologized to the neightbors, dried her copious tears, and how this body had folded into his over and over again like so much batter until the two of them became one.""

The book spans one 24 hour period, beginning with the narrator killing her mother. It weaves past and present together to form a picture of the family and how events of the past shaped the events that initiate the novel. It has a dark veil drawn over it, infusing most of it with an isolated and suicidal tone.
It was not perhaps the smartest move on my part to follow it up with a marathon of Cold Case Files on A&E."
The Almost Moon,J. Kent Messum,"September 23, 2015",3.0,"I enjoyed this novel, though not as much as Sebold's 'The Lovely Bones'. I didn't think it was stellar, but I thought it was solid. A lot of people took a massive shit on this book because they disliked Helen's character so much... but you know what? There are lots of ugly characters in the world, and they are far more believable than the fictional heroes and heroines we blindly champion because they offer us no incentive to wake up and smell the coffee.

I like REAL characters, offensive or otherwise, and Sebold definitely showed us the other side of what a protagonist in a novel can be. In fact, I surmise that Helen's character shares more in common with most people, much more than most people would ever want to admit."
The Almost Moon,Florence (Lefty) MacIntosh,"August 28, 2016",4.0,"Seems like a lot of people hated this book… I'm not one of them. There’s mental illness in my family so I appreciated the author giving a voice to how the day-to-day living with someone with a mental disorder impacts every person they touch. Wickedly funny and really well written, Sebold has a great lyrical style, paints her characters so real they breathe; I empathized. Admittedly the author leaves a lot of loose ends but I didn’t have a problem with that, enjoy a story that isn’t all tied up in a neat bundle – convinced Sebold made a deliberate choice in the ambiguous ending, a choice to leave it to the reader’s imagination."
The Almost Moon,Lorraine,"February 15, 2008",3.0,"THE ALMOST MOON is a brave book by a courageous writer. After the phenomenal success of THE LOVELY BONES, Alice Sebold could have chosen to write a sophomore novel in which she once again gave readers a sympathetic, utterly likable narrator like Susie Salmon. Instead, she writes through the voice of Helen Knightly, and Helen tells the reader, right from the beginning, that liking her is going to be a challenge:

When all is said and done, killing my mother came easily. Dementia, as it descends, has a way of revealing the core of the person affected by it. My mother's core was rotten like the brackish water at the bottom of a weeks-old vase of flowers. She had been beautiful when my father met her and still capable of love when I became their late-in-life child, but by the time she gazed up at me that day, none of this mattered.

The book, told in Helen's voice, is about the 24 hours that follow the matricide. But, in that day, Helen will veer back and forth between a present, in which she deals with the consequences of her actions, and the past, in which the costs of her mother's closeted mental illness make themselves clear to Helen in a series of flashbacks.

Helen's behavior, while at first difficult to comprehend, becomes more understandable as she narrates her story. Some readers will undoubtedly find Helen such a difficult narrator that they will be unable to empathize with her. It's part of what shows Sebold to be a writer who is willing to take risks. Creating a character who, at first read, appears vain and unempathetic, is to take the risk that a reader will not stick with the book until the end. But, as more of Helen's story is told, one sees how damaged she was by a childhood in which her parents' demons injured her. And Sebold's language and skill as a writer give to Helen a depth that demands that the reader ""hear her out.""

As Helen tells more of her story, we see the shadows of her parents' demons move across Helen's skin. She grew up in a house of secrets but Helen makes her living as a nude art model, and yet, while Helen is nude almost every day, she is rarely naked. She had learned to hide from the people who love her: her ex-husband, her best friend and her best friend's son, and Helen's two daughters, as effectively as Helen's agoraphobic mother had hidden from the world. Killing her mother forces Helen out into the open, and Sebold lets us see an imperfect woman who struggles with all-too-human issues albeit in a violent and extreme way."
The Almost Moon,Gabril,"July 31, 2018",4.0,"“Alla fin fine, ammazzare mia madre mi è venuto facile”.

Con un incipit così traumatizzante comincia la storia di Helen, figlia di una madre psichicamente instabile (aggravata da una vecchiaia demente) e portatrice di un debordante sentimento di odio-amore che viene via esplicitato, capito e giustificato dalla storia che Helen stessa ripercorre.
Voce disperatamente lucida, voce pulsionale che produce gesti agiti direttamente dall’inconscio, voce che si spezza, si arrampica, si arrotola su di sé e poi si dispiega, in un ritmo che è allo stesso tempo serrato e disteso, tanto che la definizione di ‘thriller esistenziale’ è quanto mai calzante.

Ecco che la madre, il corpo del desiderio primario, viene distrutta nell’illusione di potersene liberare, di annullarne il potere soggiogante, ma anche per il bisogno di vendicare un padre troppo amato, della cui fine la si ritiene responsabile. Insomma, la tragedia di Elettra rivisitata: oggi, nella sonnolenta e gretta provincia americana e attraverso la disfunzionalità emblematica delle famiglie contemporanee.

E proprio il corpo è al centro della narrazione di Sebold: quello della madre viene raccontato nel disfacimento naturale degli anni, nella sua riduzione a freddo cadavere, nella cura con cui viene poi lavato e accudito; quello della figlia è ridotto a oggetto estraneo o allontanato da sé in una sorta di doppio alieno: è un corpo nudo di modella, un corpo esposto per essere ritratto dagli allievi della scuola d’arte; è un corpo pulsionale che chiede di essere scopato, ovvero semplicemente messo a tacere nell’amplesso. È infine un viso estraniato, allucinato, che non si riconosce allo specchio, quando la fine di tutto appare vicina.
La fine, o quasi."
The Almost Moon,Leanna,"October 31, 2007",2.0,"I mentioned a few weeks ago that Alice Sebold’s The Lovely Bones is a disappointing and overrated book. Imagine my pleasure and delight (I always like to feel justified) when I read several reviews (The New York Times Sunday Book Review and USA Today) absolutely trashing her latest book The Almost Moon. However, Almost Moon sounded so bad that I just had to find out how bad it is for myself.

First, do not read this book. The protagonist (if I dare use that word), Helen, kills her mother. I am not giving away any plot details since Helen announces the murder in the book’s first sentence.

I am not sure what Sebold intends with Helen and her plot. Are we meant to sympathize with her? Should we feel murder is justified because her mother was not nurturing? Or is the book intended to be a glimpse inside the mind of a murderer? I suspect the first. However, I have absolutely no sympathy for Helen.

The rest of the book is a mishmash of events from Helen’s life: meeting her husband, divorcing her husband, the death of a neighbor. All these episodes, I’m sure, are meant to illuminate Helen’s psyche. Personally, they just leave me bored.

Sebold seems to delight in shocking her reader. Helen is a murderer, she uses the “f”-word as if it is sexy, she seduces her best friend’s son. Yet none of these actions is really shocking. Instead, they read like clichés.

Like I said, do not read this book. But I will also say it was not as terrible as the book reviews made it out to be. Or maybe it is, but reading the reviews took away much of the pleasure of discovering for myself how terrible the book really is."
The Almost Moon,Kellie,"July 11, 2008",4.0,"I am very troubled by this book. First, I found it so unnerving that someone could write about killing their mother. What kind of person does that? Well, I googled on Alice Sebold to find out and discovered that Ms. Sebold was brutally raped while attending college at Syracuse University. I believe that this brutal act of violence may be the catalyst that has caused Ms. Sebold to teeter on a violent edge that few authors dare to go. This book is about and told through the voice of Helen. Helen grew up with a mentally ill mother and a father who turned out to be almost as ill. Helen kills her 86 year old mother and the book follows Helen through the events that occur after the crime, as well as, Helen's thoughts of her past. There is a small section of the book that gives the reader an idea of what it was like for Helen to be a daughter of a mother like hers and how the title of the book relates to the story. “The moon is whole all the time, but we can’t always see it. What we see is an almost moon or a non-quite moon. The rest is hiding just out of view, but there’s only one moon, so we follow it in the sky. We plan our lives based on its rhythms and tides.” “I knew I was supposed to understand something from my father’s explanation, but what I came away with was that, just as we were stuck with the moon, so too we were stuck with my mother.”"

The Almost Moon,Diane,"September 9, 2008",5.0,"I LOVED: The Lovely Bones, and although several people told me that this book was totally bizarre, I had to read it and judge for myself.

Once I began Almost Moon, I could not put it down. I could understand how a 49 year old woman, a product of a dysfunctional, mentally ill family, could snap under extreme pressure and murder her elderly mother who suffered from dementia. This dark, serious novel, made me smile on more than one occasion by the author's use of clever writing techniques. I loved the way that the entire novel took place in a 24 hour period as well.

Alice Sebold did not disappoint me with this latest GEM. Read it for yourself and do not be mislead by some of the negative reviews you may read. You will miss a unusually wonderful book!"
The Almost Moon,Gary Guinn,"September 4, 2017",4.0,"“When all is said and done, killing my mother came easily.”
How’s that for an opening line? Helen’s mother needed killing, and Helen was just the person to do it. Except she wasn’t.
Sebold’s second novel, The Almost Moon, is the story of fifty-two-year-old Helen, whose father committed suicide when she was a teenager, and her spontaneous act of mercy/revenge on her eighty-year-old mother and the chaos that follows. Helen’s ex-husband, her two adult daughters, her best friend since childhood, and her best friend’s adult son are all affected by, and drawn into, the chaos.
Sebold’s first novel, , was universally praised. The average rating on Goodreads, with 1,655,999 ratings is currently 3.7. Most of the ratings and reviews are high. But when looking through the ratings for , which has an average of 2.67, with about 32,000 ratings so far, what jumps out is the incredible disparity of opinions. There seem to be about as many 1 and 2 star ratings as 4 and 5 star. Many of the people at the bottom of the ratings loved , but were disappointed, angered, revolted by . The reasons varied. Some could not stomach the basic premise of killing your mother. Many could never sympathize with the protagonist, Helen.
I come down on the higher end of the ratings, largely because I was amazed by what Sebold did with narrative time. The real narrative time of the story is twenty-four hours. Everything “happens” in that short time. But the experiential time for the reader is Helen’s entire lifetime. The narrative is in first person, from Helen’s point of view, and Sebold moves Helen’s consciousness through time flawlessly, weaving past and present into, dare I say it, a crazy quilt. I found the characters, both past and present, believable and sympathetic and powerfully motivated. As Helen gradually teases out the truth about her father and mother, and about her own marriage and family, the reader as gradually begins to understand that opening line of the novel.
I do confess the novel was slow engaging me, even after the surprising opening line and chapter. That opening line promised more than the next sixty or seventy pages delivered. I usually give a novel fifty pages to get its hooks in me. If I’m not hooked by then, I set it aside. I stayed with beyond that point because of Alice Sebold’s beautiful prose. Very early the narrator says, “As darkness descended, so did the cold. I looked down at the length of my mother’s body, wrapped in double blankets, and knew she would never feel the uncertainties that come with the fluctuation of air or light again. ‘Over now,’ I said to her. ‘It’s over.’”
So I stayed with Helen a little longer, and it wasn’t too long before I was glad I did. This novel isn’t for everyone, as the wide-ranging ratings indicate, but if you’re a fan of literary fiction, I’d recommend giving it a try."
The Almost Moon,Anne,"November 25, 2007",1.0,"In 2003, my brother bought me Alice Sebold's first novel, The Lovely Bones, for Christmas. I was into it from the first page, and I couldn't help crying my eyes out. Later, I read her memoir, Lucky. I didn't think it was quite as well done, but it was about a very powerful topic, and it gave me some respect for where Sebold had come from and how much she had overcome. So, I eagerly anticipated getting this one from the long library waiting list. The Almost Moon tackles the difficult subject of family mental illness. Given my work recently, this is an area I am very interested in - how genetics affects behavior and how families attempt to normalize ""crazy"" behavior. Unfortunately, like mental illness, this book is all over the place. Sebold switches from present time to the main character's childhood to her life with her husband and children - and does so in a way that is haphazard and often confusing. The main character (unlike John Nash in A Beautiful Mind) is completely one-dimensional and thoroughly unlikeable. Her behavior is erratic and nonsensical, but instead of painting a picture of mental illness and its devastating effects, I simply found this book boring and irrelevant. It doesn't seem like Sebold did much research into the area before she wrote this. Rather, it's like she just took pieces of bizarre behavior and threw them together hoping something would resonate. For those who have never read Sebold, please read The Lovely Bones. For those who read The Lovely Bones and loved it as much as I did, DO NOT read this book. It will only serve to taint your image of Sebold's talent."
The Almost Moon,Yennie,"October 30, 2007",4.0,"Have a healthy relationship with your parents? Then you probably won't relate to Helen, the protagonist who confesses to killing her mother in the first sentence of the novel. Alice Sebold doesn't expect you to understand what Helen has done-- even Helen doesn't quite understand it fully. Effort and compassion is needed just to start understanding the complexities of this mother-daughter relationship, and Sebold does a beautiful job exploring that aspect of an act that society condemns in a knee jerk. Great imagery, as one comes to expect from Sebold and her friends (including Aimee Bender). The ending will annoy plenty, but one has to remember that the ending of a book is not necessarily the conclusion of a story; I thought it was perfectly timed and thought provoking."
The Almost Moon,Lain,"April 17, 2008",1.0,"This is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. Not because the writing is poor -- in fact, just the opposite. Sebold is such a talented writer that what she's done with this book is nothing short of a travesty.

Am I supposed to feel sorry for Helen, the daughter of a mentally ill mother she ends up killing in her old age? There isn't enough hurt and anguish in her for me to believe she did so out of long-simmering rage. Am I supposed to feel outraged at the brutality of the act? Clair is so unsympathetic that I can't muster even the slightest cringe. Am I supposed to believe that Helen acted out of her own mental illness? If so, there isn't enough evidence to convince me that she's insane.

All in all, the book left me disgusted. Disgusted in the characters, disgusted in the plot, disgusted that I spent so many hours reading it."
The Almost Moon,Sherree W,"May 12, 2010",5.0,"So, this is the only book that I have felt a duty to review.

People who are uncomfortable with the many topics broached (topics that don't make for polite conversation) may feel that this book goes too far...

I live with an Alzheimer's patient. She is turning 90 in July. She is my mother.

Luckily, thus far she is not too much like the mother in this book, but I was gripped from the first pages. The situation and the thoughts of the protagonist, while hard to take and easy to deride, are slightly different if you have experienced a loved one's slow deterioration into a different person from dementia.

Sadly, this widely panned book is one of the finest I've ever read. Very raw, very real! Please don't discount it because of people who aren't able to 'get' this one. Alice Sebold did an amazing job and must have known she would be risking a lot to write this. I for one am very glad to have read it.

People who only want to read books where the protagonists are simply good people who make good choices are missing out on some amazing experiences. Not every book has to be about the struggle between 'Good' and 'Evil', the struggle within each of us every day is far more complex and occasionally far more interesting."
The Almost Moon,Michelle,"March 3, 2008",2.0,"Let me start off by saying that I love Alice Sebold. 'Lucky' and 'Lovely Bones' were two books that stayed with me long after I finished them.

That being said, I hate to say that 'Almost Moon' was such a disappointment to me. I had read all the bad reviews of it and thought 'It can't be that bad.' Unfortunately, it was.

Was it because the story was about an unsympathetic narrator who kills her aged mother in the first chapter? Perhaps.

The rest of the story unfolds as Helen both revisits memories of growing up and deals with what she has done.

Here is my advice: Don't bother reading this one. If you want to read Alice Sebold, pick up either 'Lucky' or 'Lovely Bones' instead."
The Almost Moon,Brittany B.,"February 19, 2013",4.0,"Awww! The low rating is so unfair... It's dark fiction about a woman tumbling out of control. It is fiction!! I'm sticking to my first impression. Despite the overwhelming consensus here at GR and prior disagreements with my own friends, I liked this book.

Anyway here's my story about this book--
I read this 4-5 years ago, when I happened to be going through a rough spell. I really liked it. It was dark, but it was not depressing to me. I saw a contrasting humor in parts of the story that seemed really messed up. I remember so many things that made me cringe and laugh at the same time. (For ex., keeping dead woman's braid under her pillow??!!...) I stayed up all night reading it. When I finished, I was excited to recommend it. (Huge mistake!!)

Within the week, I recommended this book to an older friend, who also happens to be a well-respected therapist. I even loaned her my copy.
When I saw her again, I asked, ""Oh didn't you love it?!?""
At this, she became very serious and said, ""
""

So my friend/therapist basically questioned my sanity over this book....

In her (or my) defense, I am different now, and I avoid depressing books as much as possible. (I blame my hormones for the change.) I'm far more sensitive to books, music, and even commercials make me tear up. So I doubt I would like this book as much today as I did then. But who knows?!?

Also it's not nearly as intensely depressing as Lovely Bones.

*****I do recommend by Alice Sebold. It is her own story, and it is one of the very best books I've read. (Those aren't empty words. Check my profile page, it's there!) Extremely honest and moving. And I think it will help readers understand why her books are edgy and darker than other main stream authors.****"
The Almost Moon,Kate,"February 5, 2009",1.0,"I got to page 100 when I realized I was not going to finish it. I don't know why I lasted that long. It is a very strange book, and the topic (going mad) is better covered elsewhere. At least, that's what I think the topic is. I was constantly confused who was who in the book. Was the narrator talking about a daughter, a sister, or a best friend? Was the man mentioned the father or his son who had the same name? Whatever. I'm looking for something else to read."

The Almost Moon,Deb,"August 6, 2014",3.0,"Disturbing. Probable yet improbable. Quirky. Curious. Eerie.

As I first started getting into this my initial thought was that this was so absurd that I actually laughed. But when I thought about this premise more closely I realized it's not absurd at all. Just browse past any of the various true crime cable channels or even prime time nightly news stories and it will be affirmed that this story is not only disturbingly probable but could have been lifted or adapted from one of these re-enacted accounts. The political news journalists like to focus on big city or inner city crimes when in all actuality a lot of the time it's in the suburbs of small town middle America where behind the picket fences and down the block of identically manicured lawns in a normal looking house lives a person who is crazy as hell. Who often never get help because they live the illusion of normal and end up passing on damaged parenting to poor innocent children who in turn grow up, like mother like daughter carrying on the family traits of dysfunction, putting it nicely. Disturbed, genetic criminal, if we put it bluntly. This is the case with agoraphobic Claire and poor Helen. 







This is a somewhat sad strange story of a woman who grows up playing third fiddle to her parents who were such disturbed tortured souls. Helen and her father bare the strain of her mother Claire's what seems like undiagnosed, untreated mental instability and agoraphobia for decades. They have a love hate relationship with the whole existence of their family unit. What happens when it is all just too much? At some point the dam has to break. This is that story. Through the absurd present, somewhat eerie and strange flash backs to the past leading up to the fateful day when everything changed all hints lead to the why of it all. 

This was different. You start off with the climax, so to speak and then you delve deeper into the characters as you go learning what made them tick. By the end if the book you have the full picture and you get it. On the one hand I understand, on the other there is still no excuse. On the one hand the whole family needs to plead insanity and get on some medicine ASAP. On the other hand a chain reaction was caused by the negligence of all and all guilty parties should be punished. At times I thought is is just so absurd, at other times I thought this is someone's story.
 
I'm going with a 3 stars on this one. I likes the way the author presented this and kept my attention through most of the book I would say, up to about close to the end when I just wanted the boys in blue to show up NBC TV style and just put an end to this nonsense. It drug on toward the end. I also didn't like the ending or lack there of. I do recommend it to readers of this particular author and to those who watch True crime shows or read this type of novel. Here's another way of looking inside at it."
The Almost Moon,Cecily Kyle,"February 1, 2018",4.0,"I can see why a lot of people do not like this book but I kind of get it. I mean if I had to live like she did, with a mother like that I would be bitter and a bit on the weird side too! I think she is a bit like a ""Wednesday Adams"" type character. A little dark and misunderstood.
I actually liked the book, more than the rating lead me to believe that I would. I also coincidentally read it on #bellletstalk day for Mental Illness and it was quite fitting.
Decent Read!"
The Almost Moon,Lex Larson,"October 28, 2007",2.0,"I'm currently reading this book and feel compelled to comment on it before I finish it. I am reading this book literally back-to-back with The Lovely Bones -- which I enjoyed enough to look into Sebold's other books -- but I find myself dismayed (disappointed?) with it.

Sebold has repeated imagery used in The Lovely Bones, practically verbatim. She's also reused surnames of characters. Initially I assumed this was to make some sort of callback to The Lovely Bones, implying this Stolfutz fellow was a relative of the couple who owned Stolfutz field from The Lovely Bones. But later it seemed he was just a throw-away character with a recycled name. Annoying!

Something about these characters makes me hold them at arms' length. I don't get to know them through their actions or recollections. However, I don't really want to.

At this point I'm plodding through the rest of the book out of duty and perhaps a sick fascination of how to make this seemingly aimless story end, marvelling at the protagonist's epic stupidity and frailty.

Okay, now I've finally finished it and I'm left with annoyance and lack of satisfaction with the ending. I still have an intense dislike for the protagonist and cannot fathom her behavior at all. I don't connect to any of the characters, actually. The story feels forced throughout and I wouldn't recommend that anyone pick this up (except possibly those who are unable to distinguish between 'bestseller' and 'good reading' or those dim coworkers who think critical thinking is being mean) because this book gave me nothing but disappointment."
The Almost Moon,Kelly,"February 5, 2016",1.0,"The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is my favorite book of all time, so when this came out, I was thrilled. I was so excited to read something else by this author. I hated it.

I do not feel that every book has to have likeable characters, or a happy ending, or even do things throughout the story that make sense, but I just could NOT get on board with this.

There was something about the content, writing style, and tone of this novel that was entirely lacking and very strange. I spent most of the time I read it wondering.. WTF is going on? Definitely not for everyone. Frankly, I am surprised anyone liked this book. I will definitely be sticking to Lovely Bones."
The Almost Moon,Alissa Patrick,"August 4, 2015",3.0,"This book was beyond odd. I always felt weird about The Lovely Bones as well, which is by the same author. This main character, Helen, is a borderline sociopath, and it was hard to relate to her, or feel any sympathy for her.

She comes from a terrible childhood and is now trying to take care of her agoraphobic mother who has onset dementia. Helen makes a sudden decision that will affect not only her life but her entire familys', and she spends the next 24 hours reflecting on her past.

It was a bizarre read but it kept my interest. 3 stars for that reason."
The Almost Moon,Christy,"March 9, 2008",1.0,"Wow. What a bleak, creepy disappointment. I can't believe I waited on a list at the library to read this travesty. I mean, the narrator comes right out at the beginning and tells us that she's murdered her poor mother. Then we get a depressing series of disjointed flashbacks that I forced myself to trudge through, hoping for some kind of redemption in the end. It never happened."
The Almost Moon,lacy white,"July 24, 2017",2.0,"2.5 stars

I'm starting to think that Alice Sebold isn't the author for me. Her writing is beautiful, don't get me wrong. It reads like one long poem. But her plots make no sense half the time and I'm usually either lost or bored. Which is never a good thing.

This book is about matricide....I think. It had topics such as mental illness and divorce. I'm going to be honest and say that for the most of the book, I wasn't entirely sure what was going on. The plot literally bounced from past to present in the span of a paragraph. One paragraph would be about the present and then the next time I know, we are in the past. It was confusing and incredibly frustrating at times. I think it tried to fit too much into a small amount of time and that's one of the reasons why this book failed for me.

I didn't like learning about Helen's family sooooo slloooowwwllly. For being just shy of 300 pages, it felt like a 600 page book. Maybe I should say that because I have read some incredible 600 page books that read like they were 200 pages. There were be times where absolutely nothing happened and then there would be times were twenty different things happened and I had to go back and re-read parts of the book.

I couldn't keep the characters straight because they had no personality, which didn't help me in trying to figure out what the plot actually was about. Helen was terrible both in personality and as a narrator. I couldn't really trust anything she said, which sucked because the entire book was from her POV. I had no idea and still don't about whether or not she hated her mom or what their relationship actual was.

Clair was made to look like this weak willed individual with a heart of ice. I obviously didn't care for her. Because Helen never really knew what was wrong with her, we didn't either. Don't get me wrong, that works for some books. But because this book was very character driven, I felt this really didn't help things. I don't know if I was supposed to hate Clair, feel sorry for her or both. The rest of the characters were so flat and dull that they aren't even worth mentioning. Not to mention the fact that I can't remember any of their names.

I think I am done with Alice Sebold. She has one more book that I haven't read, which is a memoir. But honestly, I'm going to pass. She obviously needs to work on writing better and building better plots. You can write beautifully but still have a plot, like Roshani Chokshi. But if you just have beautiful words and no plot, the book falls flat. Like this one did."
The Almost Moon,Ellenjsmellen,"July 27, 2008",4.0,"After reading the first line of this book, I had to continue this to see where it would finish. Interesting family life revealed through memories."
The Almost Moon,Chana,"September 14, 2009",3.0,"I want to try to write a more honest opinion of this book. Although I did not intend my first review to be dishonest I was not satisfied with it.
When I was in elementary school a girl in my class died and we went to her viewing. I felt nothing but evidently I was affected, some part of me shut off and the automatic mechanisms with which we do so much took over for awhile until I could process this overwhelming situation. Alice Sebold’s book had this kind of affect of me to some extent. I recognize some of the stupid or gross things that she said that other people have mentioned in their reviews and I definitely read the book at a remove and with a moue of distaste, but she can write and her words hit me and hit me until I was an automan reader, uh huh, uh huh, until it was over. I didn’t like the ending but looking back I accept that it was probably the inevitable ending. I am still wondering why this book was so disliked by most people when we readers consume murder, dysfunctional families, mental illness and domestic abuse in great quantities and usually lap it up. I think it is because she crosses the taboos we still hold, she writes well and at some point it just makes you sick.
Rating the book is difficult. I didn't ""like"" it but I can't rate a book that is this powerfully written less than a 3, and I certainly did not Really Like it or Love it."
The Almost Moon,-t r,"March 12, 2013",4.0,"People writing the reviews before me go on that ""there's no point"", but what if that's the point. That there are some people who are just that distraught, that mentally unstable, that, destroyed by his/her life that this vignette just makes sense?
This is a glimpse into the terrible life of someone who, for a myriad of reasons, cannot and will not deal with her demons. We get to know why the demons are there and the actions caused by those demons. But in reality, and in the course of twenty-four hours, change isn't going to happen. Life has beaten her down (and it doesn't matter that she had a fairly economically well off upbringing), the pain that her mother inflicted, that she has internalized for whatever reasons, has brought her to this place in her life.
We're so very used to slice-of-life plots and characters being , that when we get one that has snapped and, at least for the length that we're with her, isn't redeemable, many cannot deal.
This is reality. This is how many people are. We all hide our demons. Many of us deal with our demons through therapy or growth. Many don't.
This is a well-done story of one who hasn't. And I enjoyed reading it for those reasons."

Seriously???

I took out an old box of books the other day.. and was horrified to find it lurking there! so here's my reaction:

1. What the Hell! the font is so small.. were they trying to blind us?
2. 50223.. a number I wrote on the cover.. think this is my exam ID?? =D
3. I used to write my name as Rukkayea instead of Ruqayya *where did I get that from?? it sounds suspeciously like ""trachea"".. uh uh not impressive at all!*
4. On page 31 there's a drawing with the cutest skeleton EVER! looks like a shy skeleton! =D *I'll scan and upload it ASAP*
5. All over the books I doodled facesthat look very much like Harry Potter! *oh wait by that time the movies were out and I was a big fan already* *I'll try to scan an upload this page too*
6. I wrote (BFFs) -- we were the golden trio back then if you're wondering.
7. I also wrote the no. .. I have no idea what it stands for o.0, area 51 maybe??
8. On the very first I wrote 5ive. Abs *my fav. band back then and my fav. band member*

That's my review of the book.
Wait! you weren't really waiting for a review of the content.. were you?? it so doesn't deserve it!
Believe me, my rendition is way more exciting ;)

Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies","January 17, 2014",1.0,"Here's a conversation I had with a friend regarding the first 30% of this book:

“Andy, you’re overreacting—”
NO SHIT YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

It is one thing to read about a self-absorbed rhymes-with-itch when it comes to YA fiction, it is another thing entirely to encounter such a pitiful, sorry excuse of a human being in an adult contemporary. I cannot recall ever having such hatred for an adult main character within a book.

This is one of the instances when I was sorry that I have a digital copy of this book because half the way through this book, I wanted to pick up my poor abused Nook and fling it halfway across the room. I was that angry at the main character. My friend recently introduced me to a new vulgar expression; I would like to use that expression in a sentence. There has nary been a book character more deserving of being cunt-punched than Andy Sachs.

I have absolutely nothing but the utmost loathing and contempt for our main character.

It has been 10 years since . You wouldn't fucking know it from Andy's personality. In 10 years, people change, mostly for the better. They mature, they grow wiser, they ability to make sound judgment increases. Not so with our little treasure, Andy.

Her fiancé doesn't tell her about a chance encounter with an ex? Oh nooooooo he must be cheating. It's his fault. His fault. His fault. It takes two to fucking tango in a relationship, and if you can't be fucked to tell your fiancé/husband what's bothering you, then you might as well just throw in the towel now and save yourself the cost of the fucking wedding.

And that she does. Andy puts in no effort towards her relationship. It is one thing to read about the disintegration of a marriage due to differences, due to a couple slowly growing apart, to the heartbreak of each, it is another entirely to read about a marriage that suddenly fails because of the pure selfishness of one of the people involved. You can guess to whom I am referring.

Andy is now wealthy. She has a wonderful husband. She's got a gorgeous fucking home.
To be honest, I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for the newly poor-little-rich-girl that Andy has become. She is utterly vile and juvenile.

Her fear of Miranda is laughable. I understand that working under a bad boss can be traumatic, believe me, we've all fucking been there. To have such an overwhelming fear, to break into a cold sweat at the thought of her. To avoid her at all cost is just stupid. You're a fucking adult, act like it. Her husband is awesome, he gives Andy his practical opinion that she completely fucking ignores.
I loved Max, he is a sweetheart. He is the ideal gentleman, and I am on Team Max until the very end. What I hate is this book's abrupt attempt to villify Max when all along, he has been built up to be an incredible husband and father.
Seriously, there is no way that I could ever hate a man like this unless he becomes a serial rapist/killer, and I'm a hater, not a lover.

Skip this book. It is such an aggravating reading experience because there is almost no plot in it. The involvement of Miranda, the Devil herself, is minimal, and frankly, I wanted to fucking cheer whenever she appeared, because she has more personality than all of the idiotic, juvenile characters in this book combined."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Lizzi,"June 18, 2013",1.0,"Imagine if ABC Family or E! were to write a made for TV sequel for the movie ""The Devil Wears Prada,""... that screenplay would be better written and more believable a sequel than this book. The only reason I'm writing this review is to DISCOURAGE anyone even remotely curious about this book to read it. If you loved the original book, you will not enjoy this one. I read the entire thing just so I could confirm that there are no worthwhile parts in all 391 pages.

Andy becomes such an unlikeable, whiny and overall annoying character and is inexplicably (alright, the explanation is that without this in the plot, there would be no book) best friends with Emily. If that isn't ridiculous enough, they've also started a high-end bridal magazine together. Um, what? What happened to the heroine who wanted to work at The New Yorker? She's also married to what is supposed to be the JFK Jr. of the publishing world-- but don't worry thanks to THE LETTER from Max's mom, as the reader you already know that it won't last. But don't worry, in case you don't believe me, Weisberger makes that letter the central, boring plot line to the first half of the book.
The second half is also a snoozefest. You already know that they'll eventually sell to Elias-Clarke, there is no mystery about whether that'll happen. By the end Andy had become such an intolerable character anyway that I wanted her to fail. Seriously, do not read this book. Oh, and Weisberger, in the infinitesimal small chance that you ever see this, I see what you did opening this worse-than-mediocre sequel for yet another sequel, but don't. you. dare."

First of all, the title is completely nonsensical. The Devil Wears Prada, alright, Miranda Priestly is the devil and she is dressed in Prada. I can roll with that. But now ""revenge"" wears Prada? Revenge isn't a proper noun. And if Revenge is supposed to refer to Miranda, then that doesn't make sense because she has zero desire for revenge. She doesn't even remember Andy or Emily. She wants to acquire their magazine-- this isn't based on some ten-year vendetta or plot to get back at them. What the heck does ""revenge"" refer to?

Next the plot. It doesn't make sense either. Andy is so damn irrational and unsympathetic that I just want to scream at her. Where is the intelligent, down-to-Earth Ivy league grad with her head on her shoulders? The morning of her wedding, she finds a super cliche note from her future mother-in-law about how she doesn't want her son to marry her (and she never realized that BEFORE the morning of the wedding??) and a passing reference to the fact that her fiance/husband ran into an ex-girlfriend a few weeks ago. This causes her to doubt the whole wedding, immediately consider divorce after she says ""I do,"" and seemingly forget the fact that she spent the past three years knowing and loving this guy. Nope, all that goes away as she has the overreaction of a lifetime and assumes her marriage and life are over. Of course, she doesn't talk to him about this-- that would be way too rational. Her communication skills are worse than that of a 14 year old girl in her first relationship. She lets all the anger pent up inside her, leaving her new husband confused and hurt. When he explains it-- COMPLETELY RATIONALLY-- she still doesn't accept it despite having literally no reason anymore to continue being angry.

Then all of a sudden she seems to forget about all this. It'd make sense if there was a dramatic encounter with the ex-girlfriend, but no, it kind of just goes away. Alright then. Meanwhile, she's still harboring this obsessive crush on her college boyfriend who she hasn't heard from in ten years. Also weirdly, she encourages a girl in her mommy-group to cheat on her boyfriend. Uh, what? How is this in character at ALL? You'd think she'd have learned something from the whole Christian debacle, but nope.

In another extremely bizarre writing decision, Miranda Priestly is in this book for a total of, like, three scenes. It's BEYOND anticlimactic. There is no crazy Miranda behavior or big blowup between her and her former assistants. Miranda is bitchy as always, but that's about it. There's no snarky one-liners. There's no outrageous behavior or absurd demands. She's kind of just there. She actually spends two of these scenes being uncharacteristically polite and charming. Andy has been weirdly obsessing over her experience at Runway for TEN years. She has nightmares about Miranda, she feels ill at the thought of being in the same building as her. But there is no climax. She had seemingly no reason to be so worked up. Miranda is as muted of a character as they come. The whole point is that she's an outrageous, hilarious monster, but there is none of that. She's just a busy, kind of self-centered person.

Ugh, I'm just going to end this before I remember something else and get even more upset. I was looking so forward to this book. Darn you, Lauren Weisberger. I am beyond displeased.

OH WAIT I remembered another thing. What is with the multiple instances of Andy being outraged at her husband stifling on her attempts to be an independent, feminist woman-who-don't-need-no-man, only to say both times that she's secretly pleased at his reaction? Ugh, okay, I'm done now."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,anna,"March 21, 2015",1.0,"In The Devil Wears Prada, I liked Andy because I could relate to her. She was young, just out of college, idealistic with big dreams and working this glamorous job that was going to put her on the map - except her boss is the worst and the reality kind of sucks. I could empathize with Andy and wonder 'if I were in her shoes, could I do it? Could I stand to work for Miranda - and could I not get fired?'

In the sequel...I hated Andy. I found her whiny, self-absorbed and overly sensitive about everything. She basically spends the entire book creating drama for herself (her reaction after the big fight at the end is justifiable, but the fight never would have happened if she hadn't been so ridiculous throughout the book first), and she wasn't even actually dealing with Miranda. Not really. She's dealing with the possibility of Miranda coming back into her life, and it's too much for her, even though her job's going great and her rich husband is loving and wonderful and her family is so supportive. Nope, any mention of the she-beast and Andy's world falls to pieces.

And I'm sorry, but if she's still having PTSD reactions to Miranda after 10 years, she needs to get herself into some therapy. We get it. Miranda was a terror and she made your life hell for one year, but move on and get over yourself. Apparently the hundreds of Miranda's ex-assistants have managed. Why is Andy so special that she just can't deal?

And a few spoilers from here.






Here's the book I would have liked to have read: Andy Sachs is successful magazine founder, wife and new mother. Elias Clark wants to buy her magazine. Andy has reservations but decides to sell because she's confident she's now able to stand against Miranda. It's been 10 years and she's not going to put up with Miranda's bullshit anymore. She and Miranda have their clashes, but for the most part Andy's magazine stays hers. Then she finds out, to keep up with the demands of now being published by Elias Clark/to keep Miranda from taking over, Andy's becoming more and more like Miranda herself. Horrified, she makes the choice to leave her mag behind so she can be a better person to her loved ones. Boom."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Alice Raine,"June 14, 2013",1.0,"The storyline was horribly off course and the direction Weisberger chose to take these characters were completely displaced. The author did a hasty and watered down job with this sequel, not to mention, the characters were boring and lacked depth. The author clearly attempted no effort in character building this time around and the book read similar to that of a summary as opposed to a true novel. In addition, Weisberger was inconsistent with her writing format considering that she did not continue her 1st person narrative in the second book. She had turned the protagonist into another typical American tragedy and another statistic. This is quite a waste of time to read.

The ideal storyline would have been to have Andy working at The New Yorker as a successful writer of which she has the recommendation of Miranda to thank for, despite her telling Miranda off in Paris. Weisberger should have shocked the audience and made Miranda's character impressed with Andy's outburst and reaction. It would have made a more interesting story if Miranda had been pleased with her decision to leave Runway magazine. Then she could have written for Andy to have not spoken to Miranda for years. Next would be Andy being offered a leading editorial position, an immediate competing fashion magazine to Runway––thus being forced to face Miranda head on and compete with her ex-boss devil. They should have also brought Alex back as an accomplished CEO of a large and successful non-profit firm but engaged to be married. The story could revolve around a love triangle between Christian, Andy, and Alex as well as his doubts of marriage after reuniting with Andy. THEN, of course the story would end in Miranda retiring or leaving her editorial position, but shocking the audience by suggesting to have Andy step in her place, which of course Andy accepts, marries Alex and has his children. The. End.

Unfortunately, this AMAZING plot you just read does not happen in the book and you will find yourself immensely disappointed at what is actually going to unfold. The book was based on changes after 10 years, however, this is not realistic to the Fashion world as this industry booms, evolves, and transitions so quickly that 10 years was much too long and unnecessary. A great protagonist that captures the reader's attention needs to be strong and be able to accomplish his/her dreams that he/she originally set forth. The book just displayed a bunch of lost hope and the dying ""American Dream"", which NO American enjoys. If any American enjoyed reading about how their dreams don't actually come true, then they wouldn't be reading a novel... instead, they would be living out their own miserable lives."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Erin Bury,"July 11, 2013",4.0,"While everyone on GoodReads seems to hate the sequel, I thought it was an entertaining summer read. I read the first book so long ago that I don't remember the tone of the characters, and actually rather picture them as their movie versions (especially Emily & Miranda), so I didn't feel let down by a lack of consistency. The most frustrating part was how upset by her husband's omission about his bachelor party (would she really divorce him over that?) and the most unbelievable part was Alex's reappearance with a difference name. But other than that I loved Emily & Andy's relationship, her becoming a mother, and all the interactions with Miranda. Even when she was being sweet as sugar she was clearly the same evil witch underneath, just this time trying to get something she wanted. Andy did exactly what she should have at the end (my blood is still boiling thinking about what happened to her) and while I do think the end was a little too perfect, it tied up loose ends & saw her more closely aligned with the Andy we know from the first novel."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Luke Cameron,"June 24, 2013",1.0,"What a load of dribble. What the hell was this? When I saw a copy of this in my local bookstore I almost knocked down 2 children and a women to grab a copy! I immediately rushed home and opened the first chapter waiting in anticipation at what horrors Miranda Priestly could possibly put Andy through.

Having myself worked in a similar position to Andy I found the original book (The Devil Wears Prada) very insightful to read. But this....what the hell!

Lauren, if you ever get to read this my advice. Don't write anymore.

If you fancy picking up a copy because, what, you happen to love the Devil wears Prada, don't.

The story was washy to say the least, Miranda appeared what in 5 pages and the whole book was about how Andy had clearly lost all her drive as a business woman and passionate writer and became obsessed with being short-sighted and practically stupid.

I don't care for her baby to be quite frank, I don't care that she has the perfect life and squanders it away. What I care is that she made the Devil Wears Prada a mockery.

That's all."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Howard,"September 19, 2021",2.0,"2 Stars for Revenge Wears Prada, The Devil Returns: Devil Wears Prada Series, Book 2 by Lauren Weinberger read by Megan Hilty.

This was a bit of a disappointment. I recently listened to the first book in the series and thought that it was ok but not as good as the book. And now I think this book wasn’t as good as the first movie.

So Miranda uses civility and a little bit of caring to get what she wants. And Andy loses everything by being so self absorbed. And the story was building up to this show down between Miranda and Andy and nothing happened. The story seems rather poorly thought out. I like the Andy from the movie so much better."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Chelsey,"June 18, 2013",2.0,"This did not meet my expectations at all.
The title had me conjuring images of the evil Miranda, going out of her way to wreak havoc on Andy's life.
But, Miranda played a rather minor role in the book.

What I didn't like:
1) Andy and Emily becoming great friends (so much so that they start a magazine together? WHAT!?!?) was a stretch for me.
2) The writing was boring. I found myself skimming parts of it.
3) Miranda played such a minor role, and really, the actual things she did in book could hardly be called revenge.


I don't know. There were a few redeeming scenes, but for the most part, I feel really disappointed with this book.
After all the anticipation, of wanting to read the sequel to TDWP, I feel really deflated.
It was interesting noting where each of the characters ended up, but meh."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Autumn,"June 7, 2013",1.0,"I was so disappointed in this book. I thought by the Title that Miranda was going to unleash her fury on Andy for quitting her instead of her being fired. I guess i should have read the synopsis...my fault. However, I kept wondering if i got the Devil wears Prada mixed up with the heroine in Everyone worth knowing but then it didn't matter because i liked them both and thought them to be interchangeable. Not so with this book, I HATED Andy. I wanted to punch her in the face. I WANTED Max to have cheated on her. She says that Max is her best friend but then one note has her doubting him and the marriage...okay, so people do jump to conclusions but really?! if someone is described as your best friend then you know you can talk to them about anything..she did so with Lily...I really liked Max..i thought he was the one who truly showed up in the marriage and was looking out for the best interest of his wife and family. She was ready to divorce him for ""cheating"" but later encourages a woman in her mommy and me group to cheat. Then she has an encounter with Alex her old boyfriend and doesn't mention it at all to Max. So that soap box that Andy has been standing on collapsed.Emily....i didn't understand why Andy would ever be friends with Emily.I still don't..Basically the whole book is Andy looking for a reason to divorce Max and justify her passiveness on how horribly she was treated by Miranda even though she was not so stressed out to use her name to get ahead a few times...I felt bad for Max. Max was my favorite character and Andy was a bitch and I hated her. I almost DNF it but i have the rule to read what i start."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Ali,"June 19, 2013",1.0,"What the hell was this? I checked the front several times because I simply could not believe that Weisberger wrote this. It read more like a 15-year-old girl decided to write fanfiction based on the original novel. The first book was certainly not the Great American Novel, but it was fun, silly, both ridiculous and relatable at the same time, and the characters were entertaining. The characters seemed to both devolve and evolve, which is very normal for people fresh out of college, I think.

But this? I don't even know what this was. Andy was an idiot who clearly didn't learn her lessons from the first book and completely ditched her dreams and principles to delve into the world of couture and glamour once again. Um, ok. Good luck with this one, Alex. The word ""sloppy"" kept popping up in my mind. Everything about this book is sloppy. The writing, the character/plot development, the dialogue...everything. It just seemed so haphazardly put together in a clear effort to make money.

Let’s talk about Max for a second. Max confused me. Was he evil? Was he not? I didn’t understand his whole rush to get married and him wanting to “look for a ring for their one year anniversary;” the way she kept writing about it just made it seem like he had ulterior motives. Throughout the book I thought: 1. he was in cahoots with Miranda the whole time and had a deal that would help with his financial situation 2. he was gay and needed a wife (and eventually a child) to keep up with the image for the sake of his family name (and actually, when he was caught with Miles I thought they were having an affair) 3. he was somehow related to Miranda and was helping her sabotage the magazine. Instead, he came across as just weird and needy and written with zero personality: “Oh no! You are sick?? Poor BABY! Get in bed! I am going to take care of you!”

Moving onto the pregnancy. First of all, I’m pretty sure it’s illegal for a male doctor to examine a female patient without a female nurse/pa present. So, that whole doctor/Nurse Kevin thing really annoyed me. Second, was the doctor even an OB/GYN? Or was he just a GP who happened to have the equipment needed to do a pelvic examination? Again, odd. And Andy, I don’t care how “trendy” it is for pregnant women to have a drink every now and then….it’s still weird and generally considered unsafe. So drinking champagne probably wasn’t the best idea. Neither was staying in the room while your friend smoked even though you knew you should have left. “Oops! I know I shouldn’t breathe in these toxic fumes, but I miss smoking so much! Sorry Unborn Baby! Teehee!”

Characters aside, the plot was simply awful. The whole catalyst for Andy's anxiety was finding the letter before her wedding, which had exactly zero to due with the rest of the plot. I get that Weisberger needed something to kick off the Drama, but this was simply not the way to go.

And why the constant references to Andy being naked? Ok, maybe Weisberger wanted to make this a little more “mature,” and I’m not averse to a few love scenes or the description of the humiliation that can be a visit to a doctor’s office, but really, the amount of times we read about Andy being naked/partially naked/her body parts was unnecessary and over the top.

This book was not about Miranda getting revenge. This book was about Andy once again being lured to the glamorous lifestyle and realizing it is completely out of her world. Except she wasn’t even remotely likeable in this one. When did Andy become obsessed with getting up at 6am and going to the gym everyday? When did Andy care about meeting a rich guy and falling “in love” with him and everything he has? Sidenote: Any 30-year-old woman who believes that she is in love after three days of good sex is a freaking moron. I actually liked Miranda in this one, mostly because she made Andy’s life miserable.

Bottom line, this book was awful. The characters, the plot, the dialogue, the writing was awful. I didn’t expect a classic, but I was hoping for an entertaining summer read. This certainly failed on every level. I blame everyone who touched this book, from the author, to the agent, to the editor, because it was so clear they just wanted to put out something that is guaranteed to make money/make a movie sequel. I’m glad I didn’t spend money on this book.

P.S. Catherine is a Duchess. Not a Princess. Big difference. I am happy to get into a full discussion of why ""Princess Catherine"" is her incorrect title. Get it right, editing team."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Prabhjot Kaur,"March 7, 2022",1.0,"After the not-so-impressive The Devil Wears Prada I should not have picked this up but pick it up I did and read it and didn't like it. I wish I had DNFd this but instead, I skim-read it.

It's been ten years since The Devil Wears Prada but I didn't think so because of the way Andy acted. She acted even more immature compared to the first book and I didn't think that was possible. She creates all these issues that don't exist and then whines and whines and whines and whines and whines.

And, Andy and Emily are BFFs now and they quit their previous jobs and work even better jobs and those jobs are even better than the stuff dreams are made of. It read like a teenager's fantasy of the working world.

All the characters from the first book felt completely different here and they all annoyed me. The plot annoyed me. The writing annoyed me. Just everything about this book annoyed me. I didn't mind Max but it couldn't compensate for everything else.

This book felt like it was trying to be Sex and the City (show not the book) but massively failed at that. It was a complete disaster and I don't recommend this to anyone.

0 stars"
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Briar's Reviews,"September 10, 2022",3.0,"Reading Reveng Wears Prada was like meeting up with an old friend. I read the original back in 2009 for a school project (of my choosing!). I loved the movie and I wanted to see how different the book was. The first book let me down plot wise, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. In walks this books... and all of my anger and frustrations with book one was fixed. Thank you Lauren Weisberger!

I know everyone didn't enjoy this book, but at times I felt like Lauren was writing this as the follow-up to all of the complaints I made to my friends and parents over a decade ago when I initially read this book. It's a fun romp with Andy and Emily starting their own business and living out their adult lives.

Did I hope for more? Oh yes! Did it really bother me all that much? Not really. This felt like a fun, cozy beach read.

I expected Miranda to be more present and evil, but she really... wasn't. I did expect certain characters to change their ways... But I expected almost more drama. This book was so easy going, and wasn't the monster-fest I expect from Miranda Priestly (aka Meryl Streep, our mighty lord and saviour).

Overall, this is a nice follow-up that I found to be an easy read to binge. It was nice revising those characters again.

Three out of five stars."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Roxane,"June 2, 2013",2.0,"""Summer beach read,"" or ""delightful romp,"" whatever. There's a lot of fun to be had in this book but it needs another round of editing and also some better writing. The title makes absolutely no sense. The plot is just... funny. Nothing happens, then something happens, then nothing happens, then something happens. Name brand this, lavish description of that. Andy is a completely different character from Devil Wears Prada. It's like she's had a lobotomy. Emily is still wonderful. Andy's motivations and inability to speak up for herself or make a goddamned decision drove me to DISTRACTION. At several points, I just wanted to slap her and say, ""Grow the fuck up."" Also, she basically has PTSD from working for Miranda Priestley and so that's also a thing. Gah. So much goes wrong in this book. But I don't regret reading it. I had fun! I laughed a lot. It's nowhere near as good as Devil Wears Prada, though, a book I truly enjoyed."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Wendy Felton,"July 10, 2013",1.0,"I stayed up most of the night reading this. That's not because the book was so compelling, but because I was waiting--fruitlessly!--for either revenge or Prada to factor in. The title would be completely misleading, except that eventually a very minor character, so minor she has no actual dialogue, is cited as having a Prada backpack customized with puffy paint.

Among the failings of this book:

--Andrea Sachs has become everything she hated in the first book.

--The revelation that Emily eats is perhaps the most surprising thing to happen in nearly 400 pages. (That ""surprise"" that happens a few chapters in? COME ON. Not remotely surprising to anyone over the age of 12.)

--The only character who demonstrates any personal growth whatsoever is an infant.

--The devil we all know so well appears in just a handful of scenes and is not remotely devilish in most of them.

--And revenge cannot wear Prada, because revenge is a concept and not a person.

Anyway, even if revenge could wear clothes, there's no way Andy would know who'd designed them, because she spends the entire book staring at her own navel. Avoid."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Mme Forte,"August 26, 2013",2.0,"Two stars for some witty bits. It deserves one for everything else.
Things I Hated About This Book:
1. The protagonist has become an idiot. She conceives an angst about her husband's love for her due to a) his failure to inform her that he ran into an ex-girlfriend during his bachelor weekend and b) a note she finds from his mother where the mother discloses that she thinks Andy is a social inferior who will put her career ambitions before her husband/future family. Despite the husband's obvious love for her, and the fact that he shows NO signs of sharing his mother's classist views, Andy has to go totally outer limits and hold her wonderful man at arm's length to the point where she doesn't want to tell him she's pregnant -- though Mr. Wonderful has been going on about marriage and children since their first date. PLEASE. This does not enhance or advance the plot; it just makes me think our heroine is an emotional midget.
2. Sloppy, sloppy writing and crappy editing. Example: Andy and Mr. Wonderful meet at a business dinner, which Mr. W spends conversing with a cleavage to his left. For some reason, to which we are not made privy due to SLOPPY WRITING, when he gets up to go into the house, Andy follows him. She does this despite having barely spoken to him during dinner, and as far as we know BECAUSE WE ARE NOT TOLD, without even glancing at him from under her lashes and registering his brooding good looks and his velvety baritone voice and obvious wit and intelligence and DYING to get to know him better so she undoes the top two buttons of her dress and chases him down. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? The author should have done it, or if she didn't her editor should have made her do it, so I didn't have to.
3. Luxe porn (my new coinage -- sorta like food porn, but with designer names) should NEVER substitute for character development or plot advancement. There are at least 3 full pages of nothing but descriptions of interiors, and believe you me they're HIGH END, BABY. This needs to stop. Tell me why the main character has turned into such an emotional basket case instead, for starters. Save paper.
4. Lousy usage. Andy at one point ""kneads"" her hands. First of all, I assume this means the same thing as wringing one's hands. Second, if you can knead your hands while you're holding a cell phone, congratulations. I can't. ""Knead"" rears its misused head at another point, where Mr. Wonderful's brow ""kneads"". Again, I must assume this means the same thing as one's brows KNITTING.
There's more, but it puts me in a bad mood to write about it so I'll stop here. Do not waste your time on this. You will never get that time back."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Emmanuelle,"October 29, 2013",1.0,"Well, that was a loss of time.

First off, I want to mention that I liked Devil Wears Prada. I thought it was fun...although I liked the movie better.

Revenge Wears Prada is false representation.

You see Miranda a mere 3 times, not even 3 full chapters. And she doesn't really take her revenge...it ISN'T revenge. It has nothing to do with it. NOTHING.

I also want to mention that this book is a 381 page of nothing. Nothing happens. It's boring. Boring boring boring.

The characters in the book don't even hold their previous anything. It's like they are teenagers instead of aging 10 years.

This ""book"" was obviously written to ride the wave of Devil again, because the ""author"" obviously cannot write a decent book. She needed more money from her sole ""decent"" book.

Do not buy this book, do not borrow this book, do not waste your time with this book.

It's not even movie material as NOTHING happens.

I think the ""author"" just has a fantasies of a prestigious lifestyle she will never ever be able to get her hands on.

Have I mentioned that nothing happens for 380 pages and that it's a total waste of time?

Oh and I predicted the ending the second I opened the book...LOL.

Seriously, this isn't worth you time. It sure as hell wasn't worth mine.

Oh and Miranda isn't even really her Miranda self.

Did I convince you this book isn't worth it yet?

DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!

There is nothing more to say.

DO NOT READ THIS BOOK."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Ellis Cardwell,"July 21, 2013",1.0,"I loved DWP and counted down to the release of this for months. I was so excited and began reading it last night. I've just finished it and I am so disappointed. The title is completely misleading, as I never read anything about Miranda Priestly getting revenge or the girls getting revenge on Miranda (correct me of I'm wrong). I grew tired of Andy's unnecessary complaining about how MP ruined their lives (its been 10 years, move on).Andy is a character who I neither like nor disliked, I was simply disinterested in her. She's a completely different character than in DWP, and is now quite boring and weak, and never funny. The story was difficult to follow with random flash backs and massive parts of the story missing (such as the birth of her daughter and the divorce). And my biggest complaint of all is the name she chose for her daughter, I felt ill everyone I read about her. I cannot imagine Andy from DWP naming her daughter Clementine (Clem for short *vomit*). There were some opportunities to develop the story further, such as Andy's relationship with her mother in law. I am usually a fan of chick lit, even if it just a novel that contains no real substance and is just entertaining, but this novel was just bad. However, it helped me to pass a few hours on this rainy afternoon. I wouldn't recommend this book at all."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Rochelle,"June 29, 2013",2.0,"The Devil Wears Prada was by no means a literary masterpiece, but at least it was entertaining. The same cannot be said of this book. I kept waiting for Miranda to make an appearance as she was the best part about the book and the movie. But she doesn't even appear until about half-way through the book, and even then she's a minor character at best. Instead we're subjected to listening to the protagonist Andie whine about anything and everything even while we're informed that she's getting married to Mr. Perfect, has a great career and is about to be a new mom. The only reason I kept reading was for the payoff hinted at by the title, but it was all a big tease."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Britany,"July 7, 2014",2.0,"I must confess that I did not actually read The Devil Wears Prada but did LOVE the movie. While this book picks up 10 years after Andy Sachs leaves Miranda Priestley in Paris. Andy finds herself in a new relationship and running her own bridal magazine ""The Plunge"" with frenemy Emily (yes, the same one from Runway).

At first, it was fun-- but very quickly the author took this book in a direction that was dull and unrealistic. Without giving away major plot points, just didn't have the same appeal that the movie brought. I was bored, and found myself unconnected with the characters. I was grateful for the end of this sequel, only to find myself rolling my eyes at the implausibility!"
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Book Concierge,"July 21, 2021",2.0,"Digital audiobook narrated by Megan Hilty

Subtitle: The Devil Returns
This is a follow-up to the immensely popular The Devil Wears Prada .

Several years after the ending of the first book’s plot, Andy and her former nemesis, Emily, join forces and create a high-end bridal magazine that garners them much attention … including from Miranda Priestly, their former boss at . Meanwhile, both have gotten married and are navigating the ups and downs of the newly married.

This book deals with the drama of the early working life of most singles, and/or newly married couples. They have to juggle demands of their careers against the pull of the relationships. They’re not always sure whom to trust and sometimes overreact, while at other times giving in to intertia and the status quo.

I have to say that Andy really irritated me. Her go-to position seemed to be to wait in silence, while feeling sick and tired of it all. Emily was equally clueless about friendship, dismissing Andy’s hesitancy in favor of her own ambition.

I’d already read book three in the series (which focuses on Emily), so that may have colored my reactions.

Megan Hilty does a fine job of narrating the audiobook. She sets a good pace and has clear diction, so I could easily understand even when listening at double speed."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Camilla Bromley,"June 23, 2013",1.0,"I just finished this book and even though I haven't written a review before this book compelled me to do so. I agree with other commenters that the style of writing in this book feels half hearted best. I was extremely irritated by just how disjointed the whole thing felt, the flip flopping between the past and present was irritating at best.. The worst thing about this book is that I genuinely loved The Devil Wears Prada, not particularly well written but a great light hearted read where I genuinely liked Andy... That's why it saddens me the direction the book was taken in, Andy turns into a selfish, self absorbed character whom I genuinely no longer like. The ending (don't worry I won't give away the plot) left me feeling sad, as a testament to the first book I still wanted things to work out but it just felt like going back 10 steps for a rom com I genuinely hoped for a happy ending instead of the TERRIBLE and rather depressing end. I genuinely wish I hadn't read this book as it has completely tarnished the first book foe me.... If you haven't read this book for your sake don't."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Sheila Guevin,"July 3, 2013",1.0,"Epic fail on so many levels, but let me just name a few:

1. Lacks the originality and fun mean girl spirit of the first book.

2. Lacks that same you are living it feel.

3. In the original book, we see a young woman torn between the path to the next stage in her life and giving up because her boss is a beast. But we also see how working for Miranda makes some positive and negative changes in Andrea, until she reaches a breaking point and comes to her senses about what is really important to her. In this book, Andrea seems to lack a real moral compass and is a watered down version of her original boss. Though the writer paints her as someone who now knows her real values, she comes off as someone who is inflexible and immature.

4. Without giving away the plot, let me just say that the supporting characters are written in a stereo-typed and disposable way.

In the original book, Andrea takes a real journey and the reader is along for the ride.

This book could be wrapped up in a few judgemental words: shallow and predictable."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Jasprit,"September 3, 2013",4.0,"I admit to being not a huge fan of The Devil Wears Prada book, it was a decent chick lit read, but after watching the film again recently (I’ve lost count the number of times I’ve watched it) that when I heard about the follow up book I felt really encouraged in giving it a go. And I’m so glad that I did because it was the best chick-lit book I have read in a long time.

In Revenge Wears Prada, we find ourselves back with Andy ten years after she left Miranda Priestly hanging at Paris fashion week. For Andy that was the worst year of her life, she didn’t expect that ten years later when Andy was actually happy with what was going on in her life that Miranda would once again threaten to have an impact in her life once more.

I adored Andy’s character, despite everyone saying that she had made the biggest mistake of her life those ten years ago; she was actually leading a successful life. Her magazine The Plunge had been bringing in a steady income for nearly the last three years and they had been having great success with big name stars lining up to feature in the magazine. And she was about to marry the love of her life Max. But then all of a sudden things started getting pretty stressful.

Andy had so much to deal with so early on that I found myself immediately backing her corner, the Andy we once knew had matured into an even more confident woman. It was easy not to form such a strong connection with her character as all she wanted to achieve was the best out of life. She was always one to think things through carefully and not make selfish, impulsive decisions like a lot of other characters did. I think this is one of the reasons I wasn’t able to rate Revenge wears Prada 5 stars, I absolutely adored this book, but a character who I really became to like over the course of the book, they had literally won me over made the biggest mistake possible. I think I was truly left heartbroken for a few days afterwards after things had gone down.

Weisberger did a brilliant job in creating new characters that were easy to fall hard and fast for. Max was an absolutely wonderful inclusion to this book; he was considerate, sweet and had some swoony moments. I admit that he did completely win me over with his gentle side that I didn’t pay attention in the slightest when some ex’s showed up on the scene. It was also great getting to know returning characters once more. Miranda once again was a difficult character to get my feelings around. Whereas I detested her immensely in The Devil wears Prada, she brought out a whole another side to her, that at times I was confused about whose character to believe.

Revenge Wears Prada was a wonderful follow up to the Devil Wears Prada. The wait for this book I would have to say was definitely worth it, with Weisberger bringing another entertaining story. There were some crazy stressful times, a pinch of heartbreak along the way (I am seriously still not over this betrayal!) but overall a whole lot of fun. If you’re in the mood for a fun read or a quick pick me up when feeling low, this is the perfect book to go to.

Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Mrs. Kristin,"December 15, 2015",1.0,"Normally I don't rate a book I DNF because it's kinda rude. However, I have read enough of Lauren Weisberger to officially and publicly denounce any loyalty I may have had for her. As much as I love classics and fantasy, every once in a blue moon a girl needs some fluff. Lauren Weisberger's books were sort of like that for me...my fluffy books. The Devil Wears Prada was actually an excellent book considering it is mostly classified as chick-lit. I loved it so much that I actually read two more of her books only to be let down every time I read them. Now, after buying this book at Powell's (at a steep discount....thank God) I can officially say she is a one-hit-wonder.

The MC from Devil Wears Prada isn't in this book. Andy from the first book isn't even close to the same Andy in this book. The writing style is so simplistic and cliché, I thought I accidentally purchased a harlequin novel from Fred Meyers. I just.....just.....I'm speechless! When I discovered that there was a sequel floating around for this I was elated. But when you actually read it....complete and utter disappoint sets in and you are left scratching your head at HOW IT EVEN GOT PUBLISHED.

Lauren, we are officially done. In the words of Heidi Klum....auf wiedersehen.

Now....how to resell my used copy of this trash? Donate it."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Heidi,"November 4, 2018",2.0,"So much mediocre, messy, silly writing between a handful of good scenes.

The best parts, of course, were the scenes featuring our heroine’s favorite fashion and career nemesis. The rest was contrived conflict and drama.

Disappointing..."

Too many excellent books waiting for me.
Sad that I bought it, even though it was at a thrift store and hardly cost me anything, but..."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Laura,"June 27, 2013",1.0,"This book should of been relegated to the back catalogue of Mills and Boon. Biggest load of drivel. When I seen this I got so excited and had to read it straight away despite being halfway through a book that was actually decent. First mistake right there. My second mistake was actually bothering to finish it!
Maybe I expected to much but I can't be the only one who envisioned Miranda getting revenge in a deeply twisted and cunning way. In the first few chapters I thought it would have something to do with her and the wedding note. That might have actually led to a half decent plot....but nope. That storyline was magically ended when a baby came along. Hallelujah- the baby saves the marriage - for a wet weekend. So no Miranda based revenge there...
Hmmmm so maybe it'll have something to do with the magazine sale. Nope instead she will give then even more money than first offered. Why how utterly dastardly of her. If that's someone's idea of revenge, well excuse me if I go around trying to make a few enemies!
Its like the author just went up to some random person and went ""Here's €50, go write a book just include the names Andy,Emily and Miranda and don't bother worrying about making them even similar to the previous book - it'll be grand"".
The only thing I will say is Max her husband gets the short stick. Several times he goes to talk to Andy about the sale and she tells him to stop talking. All the while saying how hard he's been working trying to make money and get the family business back.
I really wish I'd purchased this in paperback instead of Kindle so I could set fire to it!!!"
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Carolynn,"June 19, 2013",1.0,"If you loved the first book, don't read this one. What a lazy, predictable effort... Who knew I could get so irritated at a chick book?? Weisberger reduces the Andy character to a whiny, insecure, pushover and, rather than following through and describing what could have been some great confrontational moments, she brings the characters to the cusp of a huge moment and then *POOF* suddenly skips ahead to weeks or even many months later. Nothing is resolved. The Miranda character pops in and out intermittently to throw in some death looks and bitchy jabs, but the storyline involving her carries on far longer than necessary. Max and Emily end up behaving exactly as you expect they will, and the ending is so predictable I could have cried. There is only one real ""OMG"" moment involving one of the women from Andy's new mommy group, and even that ends up disappointing. Overall, this book doesn't come close to measuring up to the originality of the first. Let's just hope the actors from the first movie are smart enough to say no to the sequel. Recommendation: SKIP IT."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Nadja,"July 9, 2022",1.0,"Ich habe circa die ersten 70 Seiten gelesen, danach immer wieder überflogen und als Abschluss die letzten 100 Seiten noch gelesen. Und ich bereue es überhaupt nicht. Schon seit Beginn ist Andy total unsymphatisch und die ganze Geschichte total konstruiert. (Plötzlich beste Freundin mit Emily - Feindin von Band 1?) Der Devil aka Miranda erscheint gerade auf wenigen Seiten, sonst handelt es nur von dem langweiligen Leben von Andrea Sachs. Sehr enttäuschend und nicht minimal so gut wie Band 1. Zeitverschwendung pur."

This was good for the nostalgia of the characters.

This was bad because Andy is even worse. In fact, she is likely the worst character in the entire book.

The ancillary characters make the book and have lives better for her walking away from them, ahahha.

Solid 3, because there was still a guilty entertainment value."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Marie,"November 12, 2013",2.0,"On se souvient du Diable s’habille en Prada, des aventures d’Andrea Sachs, jeune fille fraîchement sortie de l’université et embauchée comme assistante à la rédaction de Runway par la terrible Miranda Priestly. On avait apprécié la satire du monde de la mode, on avait assisté impuissants mais passionnés à la métamorphose d’une héroïne sympathique en requine aux Louboutin acérées, on avait applaudi la spectaculaire démission finale.

On entend parler de la sortie de la suite, Vengeance en Prada. La couverture est belle, le titre et surtout le sous-titre (Le retour du Diable) sont alléchants parce que finalement la vraie héroïne du Diable s’habille en Prada, ce n’était pas Andy et ses rêves remisés au placard, mais bien l’inoubliable rédactrice en chef de Runway, Miranda Priestly, son arrogance mythique et ses écharpes Hermès en soie blanche. Avec un enthousiasme qui frise l’hystérie, on attend fébrilement la sortie du livre, on se jette dessus, on le commence, on s’étonne, on s’ennuie, on s’énerve, dans le doute on continue, on va au bout et… on le jette à la poubelle.

L’histoire :

8 ans après les événements du Diable s’habille en Prada, Andrea a fondé un magazine haut de gamme spécialisé sur le sujet du mariage avec Emily, son ancienne collègue de Runway. Le roman commence par le mariage d’Andy avec Max. Le jour-J, Andy trouve une lettre de sa future belle-mère qui recommande à son fils d’annuler le mariage, persuadée qu’il peut trouver mieux (ce qui de mon point de vue de lectrice, semble être un conseil fort avisé qu’il ferait bien de suivre).

Note : si ne pas s’entendre avec sa belle-mère constituait un motif de divorce (ou un sujet viable pour un roman), il n’y aurait plus de mariages (et beaucoup trop de romans).

On commence la lecture avec quelques millions de flashbacks nébuleux et mortellement ennuyeux, nécessaires pour justifier l’injustifiable, i.e. qu’Andy est devenue la meilleure amie et associée de sa pire ennemie, Emily, et qu’elle a démissionné de Runway pour devenir chroniqueuse sur un blog de mariages puis lancer avec succès et une facilité déconcertante son propre magazine.

On aurait pu croire qu’Andy avait tiré une leçon de ses expériences passées. Grave erreur. À 33 ans Andy n’a pas grandi d’un neurone et reproduit avec application toutes les bêtises du premier tome, sans l’excuse, cette fois, de son inexpérience.

On lit, on lit, on commence à sauter quelques pages et à penser à autre chose et on attend désespérément que ça commence. Vient alors la deuxième partie. Andrea est tombée enceinte et Elias Clark, le groupe auquel appartient Runway et où travaille donc Miranda Priestly, décide de racheter The Plundge, le magazine d’Andy et d’Emily. Enfin, on a droit à quelques vagues et décevantes apparitions du “Diable” qu’on nous avait promis dans le titre, malheureusement quasi-inexistant de cette très très longue histoire.

Au passage, Vengeance en Prada, le retour du Diable est un titre inadapté pour ce récit où il n’est question ni de vengeance, ni de Diable et qui, quitte à mépriser toute logique, aurait tout aussi bien pu s’appeler Star Wars, la menace Fantôme ou Martine à la ferme. Ceci dit je comprends que le titre approprié, à savoir, Pleurnicheries absurdes d’une trentenaire sans cervelle ait été refusé par le département marketing.

Du reste, même après avoir terminé cette lecture, je n’ai toujours pas compris si c’est Miranda qui se venge d’Andy, Andy qui se venge de Miranda ou (hypothèse la plus probable), Lauren Weisberger qui se venge de ses lecteurs en leur imposant la lecture de ce livre long et décousu aux personnages antipathiques et aux comportements incohérents…

Je m’arrête ici et je ne raconterai pas la fin de l’histoire qui, il faut bien lui reconnaître cette qualité, est imprévisible, du moins pour tout lecteur rationnel puisqu’elle n’a absolument aucun sens.

En conclusion, trop de livres, pas assez de temps et de place sur vos étagères, lisez autre chose ou allez faire des meringues, mais n’achetez pas Vengeance en Prada, ne serait-ce que pour éviter que cette suite ratée et inutile entache le beau souvenir du premier tome, qui se serait suffit largement à lui-même.

That’s all.

Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Kate,"July 4, 2013",2.0,"As a long time Devil Wears Prada fan, I’ve been excited about this sequel since I first heard it existed. Unfortunately, Revenge Wears Prada fell short of my expectations.

Andy still has nightmares following her year as Miranda Priestly’s assistant at Runway magazine. However, ten years on, Andy has moved on and is doing well. She’s the co-founder and editor in chief of a high end bridal magazine, about to get married to a successful and handsome man and has some fantastic friends in her corner. But just before walking down the aisle, Andy finds out that her husband-to-be may not be as faithful and open as she thought.

I wanted to like this book. I loved the first and was so excited to be back in the world with Andy, Emily and the devil herself – Miranda Priestly. However soon after starting I started to wonder if I’d glamourized the first book in my memories.

We get to see many of the characters from the first novel – with first-assistant Emily becoming Andy’s BFF and former flame Alex reappearing in Andy’s life when she least expected it.

My problem with this book was the characters. Andy is shallow and so much more self-centred than I remembered with double standards and an amazing lack of consideration for anyone who isn’t Andy. I didn’t understand her actions or motivations and found myself losing interest in how things ended up for her. Her complete disregard for her husband’s feelings frustrated me – she expects him to be open and honest when she keeps all sorts of things from him ALL THE TIME.
The ending – whilst not a complete surprise – still left me wondering just why the author decided to end things as she did. It felt rushed and out of place considering the rest of the book.

Revenge Wears Prada is a great opportunity to delve back into the world of high fashion and celebrity name droppers however it missed the mark for me. Despite occurring a decade after the first book, none of the characters showed any growth and the appearance of a certain famous tennis star could not have confused me more."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Melinda Elizabeth,"June 8, 2013",2.0,"Maybe I've been spoiled by the extravagant plots of the tv series, ""revenge"", but when I think of that word, it invokes malicious, twisted venomous plots to destroy, maim, torture and humiliate. And I was rubbing my hands together with glee imagining Miranda's revenge, after Andy's famous Paris slight of the fashion maverick. Unfortunately this sequel doesn't deliver.

What you get instead is a boring cross between ""what to expect when you're expecting"" and a mish mash of all those other dull, predictable chick flick books that you've read far too many of to enjoy anymore.

The beauty of ""Prada"" was its ingenuity, it was fresh, the slight tweak on a very well known editor in chief and it's tongue in cheek parody of the fashion world made it a great read. This book just doesn't live up to the strong foundations laid in the first book, and honestly I wish I never read it. My minds eye vision of the characters post Runway was far more exciting than this drivel.

The ""revenge"" part of the book, be it from either side of the spectrum, didn't come to pass, and the shock horror PTSD inducing drama the book runs with is fairly weak, considering that the first book made you cringe with secondhand embarrassment for Andy when she was being raked over the coals by Miranda. She hasn't grown, she's still a doormat and infuriatingly naive, and I would have loved to have seen her descend into a little bit of Miranda-eqsue behaviour as a bit of a storyline but alas, not to be.

Please, if you enjoyed the first book, don't ruin it by reading this."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Kim,"June 8, 2013",1.0,"I was looking forward to this book and pre-ordered for my Kindle so I'd have it as soon as it was available. First thing Tuesday morning, I jumped out of bed and grabbed my Kindle, ready to begin my day with breakfast, Andy, Emily and Miranda.  Unfortunately, what I found was disappointing. 

I REALLY tried to enjoy it. In fact, I thought that maybe I hadn't had enough coffee yet...so I set the book down, grabbed another cup, of coffee and sat back down and started in again.  I made four attempts to get through the book, and just couldn't do it.

Maybe it's unfair to review a book I didn't finish, but I'm couldn't resist sharing my thoughts. In the limited chapters I read, there was nothing that grabbed me to make me want to get through the book.  I found that the characters that we knew from The Devil Wears Prada, seem non-existent now nor, did I find the story line something I wanted to read.

I'm a fan of  Lauren Weisberger and adored The Devil Wears Prada, Everything Worth Knowing, Chasing Harry Winston, etc.  I'm heartbroken that I can't add ""Revenge Wears Prada"" to my list of favorite books."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Rob Boffard,"September 8, 2013",1.0,"I loved Weisberger's debut novel. The Devil Wears Prada was outstanding: slick, smart, and with a lead character who I fell in love with. And then, there was Miranda Priestly. She leapt off the page with every barb, every snide remark.

But this? This is Devil Lite. This is Lesser Demon. This is Imp.

Please don't make me describe the plot. I'll start crying. Andrea Sachs has been reduced to a caricature: a simpering mess of a woman, neither believable nor fun to be around. She is - impossibly - friends with former arch-enemy Emily because...well, just fucking because, OK? Her new squeeze is impossible to like, and when you're just beginning to warm to him, he does something vastly out of character.

And Miranda? The burning heart of the story? She's been doused with a fire extinguisher. She's hardly here, and when she is, she's nowhere near as much fun. More importantly, there are a few chances for Andrea to have at it with her former boss - a few chances for a great moment like the Paris finale in the original. But Weisberger bottles it. Utterly and totally.

Don't read this. It's beyond rubbish."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,Kristine,"June 16, 2013",1.0,"What a terrible disappointment! I felt like I was reading about a completely different character. Andy is completely unlikable...whiny, immature and annoying. She has lost all of her idealism and has become a weak and unhappy person who can't seem to appreciate all the wonderful things in her life. And the fact that she has night terrors about Miranda 10 years later is ridiculous. Sure, Miranda is mean but get over yourself! How can she be the successful business person the novel claims she is when she still can't deal with one year as Miranda'a assistant? Especially when she is still working in fashion and with celebrities...are they all supposedly nice as pie? The book was so lame I should have stopped reading 1/3 of the way through but kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. Don't waste your time."
Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns,catherine ♡,"June 17, 2021",2.0,"I...actually liked this better than the first one? It was less Miranda (which means less wanting to tear my hair out) and even though I still pretty much hate all of the characters, I actually felt invested in the acquisition plot and felt righteous anger for Andy over it.

My only problem was that it felt very anticlimactic — this big thing finally happened 95% of the way into the story and we never got to see the fallout from it. Instead, the book time jumped and gave us an epilogue, listing out things that happened. I’d have much rather read about it in real time instead of spending so much time in the first half on a bunch of marriage issues for a couple that was never gonna be endgame anyways.

I just wish there hadn't been any romance subplot; in both this book and its prequel, there was this constant justification and glorification of cheating that really got on my nerves."

Four Blondes,Sara (sarawithoutanH),"April 17, 2018",1.0,"CW: eating disorders and fat shaming (so much weight shaming in general)

**I will be including some quotes directly from the book, so please be advised as they will include some of that content warning.

I'm just so confused and appalled by what I just read. I don't understand what Candace Bushnell was trying to say? The back of the book claims, ""She chronicles the lives of four beautiful women [...] as they face turning points in which each must choose between her passions."" I don't know what book they read to make that blurb, but what I read was a heap of self-absorbed drivel that relied heavily on stereotypes. I thought the first story was terrible but then the second and third one had me debating which was the worst. The fourth story just seemed like a last minute add-on (it's the shortest and least detailed). If the Sex and the City book is anything like this, it amazes me both that it was published AND that it was made into one of the most well-known television series of all time.

Also, Candace Bushnell takes every opportunity to weight shame. Everyone is too fat and too thin all at once and there is just constant attention brought to how women look in these stories. I just don't understand what point Bushnell is trying to make. I don't doubt that vapid and self-absorbed women exist in the world, but why tell these stories? I just don't get it. This book doesn't feel like it has a point. I don't like any of the characters, but their unlikeability feels like it has nothing to say. I'm fine with unlikeable characters. I just want there to be a point. On top of that, the writing is terrible. There's no sense of movement in the narrative and it's awkward trying to follow exactly what the characters are doing at any given point.

I'm going to include some quotes now just to illustrate the strangeness and awkwardness of the story, and also to bring to light some of the stereotyping and weight shaming.

""Janey, who had a fat belly and fat thighs, was never able to distinguish herself. At fourteen, when she got her period, her mother said, 'Janey, you must be careful with boys. Boys like to take advantage of girls who are not pretty because boys know the girl is desperate for attention.'"" p. 25

""Winnie still considers it part of her job to be the good-looking one in the relationship. Being good-looking is part of mastering the world. It is part of being perfect. (It is not about being beautiful. Beautiful women are self-indulgent. Beautiful women are stupid because they don't have to try.) She is five-seven and weighs 125 pounds. If she let herself go, let her body reach its natural weight, she'd probably weigh between 130 and 135 pounds. But she won't let herself go. (It's about control.) ... If she is two pounds overweight, she takes care of it. Taking care of herself is part of being a nice girl."" p. 91

""I take off all my clothes and step on the scale; Weight, 117.5 pounds. Percentage fat, 13. GOOD. I've lost a quarter of a pound from the morning."" p. 143

What is shocking to me is that this is from three different stories, which are about three different women. Why is there so much emphasis on this? None of the women seem happy. They all seem trapped and sad. Please just stay away from this book."
Four Blondes,Diane,"February 26, 2007",1.0,"This book doesn't even deserve one star. This has to be one of the worst books that I've ever read in my life. I only kept reading it in the ridiculous (and futile) hope that it surely would have to get better at some point. Surely the women who came up with the idea for Sex in the City couldn't possibly suck THAT bad as an author.

Well as it turns out, she can. Don't waste your time or anyone else's with this book. It's about 4 stupid women who make ridiculous choices and live lives consumed by selfishness and boredom.

I wouldn't even let my dog read this book."
Four Blondes,Katie B,"August 3, 2018",2.0,"I'm not quite sure what the author was going for with this one. This was published after her previous book, Sex and the City and maybe she was hoping to catch lightning in a bottle twice. Regardless, this one just did not work. The characters featured in the short stories are unlikable which actually isn't the biggest problem. The issue is you just don't give a crap about their stupid lives. This book is missing heart, substance, and whatever else that gives you a compelling urge to flip the pages to find out more. To be honest, if I didn't have an annoying habit of having to finish books I paid for even when in this case I picked it up for a dollar at a thrift store, I wouldn't have bothered reading til the end. Definitely do not recommend."

― Candace Bushnell, Four Blondes



What a gloomy book. This book ""Four Blondes"" is by Candace Bushnell who of coarse wrote ""Sex and the city"". I liked that book and love the series so I was curious about this book.



It is a Series of short stories about different women. The only thing they have in common is they are all blondes. It did look interesting.

So this is pure chick lit and I enjoyed maybe one of the stories (the first one). But surprisingly, rather then being fun, I found this little book to be rather dreary.

Very few of the women in these stories are likable and the stories were on the dull side. There was a sadness to a few of them that surprised me but other then that there was not anything memorable and it was sort of a let down. Actually scratch the ""sort of"".

It is readable and it's short to but honestly I did not get much from it. This is not a book that I personally would recommend unfortunetly."
Four Blondes,Hilari,"January 28, 2009",1.0,"Bushnell is one of the worse writers of all time. I hope she wakes up every morning and thanks whichever god she believes in because however she got Sex in the City published is supernatural. That someone saw past her schlocky prose to an award-winning television series is beyond me.

Four Blondes is a trite story about four women you couldn't care about if they were on fire on the midtown bus. Their stories, remarkably, are less interesting. Read this book only if you are being threatened with death. Or worse."
Four Blondes,Betsy,"December 4, 2013",,"Terrible. I finally followed the 50 page rule, where if it's not good by the first 50 pages, dump it. This was the worst book I have ever attempted.

The storyline and characters were so unrealistic, fake, and BORING! Don't bother."

----Liz Taylor

Candace Bushnell, an international best-selling author, has penned a sassy tale of four blond women from Manhattan, in her book, Four Blondes that narrates the tale of four different women, independent and strong-willed, who pave their way in the jungle called life by standing strong along with the men, fashion, age, needs and fame and to claim fame, they would do anything for it.







A selfish and lazy ex-model, a career-minded and dominating journalist, a paranoid princess and an aging ""IT girl""- all four had few things in common, they all belong from The Big Apple, all four are thoroughly selfish, all four are unexceptionally modern out of their times, and not to mention they are all blondies. So why read about these four feminist women? Well, my answer will be, if you are getting bored and wanna read something light, something like no-strings-attached, something that will give you a good laugh, then you may pick a copy of this book. Well, I won this book from 's giveaway along with a copy of . It may not disappoint you, considering the fact that you are an occasional reader, but serious readers like me, might tear apart this book with words of criticism. But I can hardly ever trash a author's hard work, hence, I'd like to give this book 3 stars, since I got it for free, and secondly, the book cover is really pretty.

I can't complain about the author's writing style, its funny, sassy and way too polished. The narrative too is quite alluring and catchy with a really fast pace. The author pens this book with her trademark style of boldness, independence and feminism. The story line is layered with lots of funny anecdotes and remarks related to sexism.

Well, I was pretty aware what I was getting myself into, before reading this book. Unfortunately, the author has projected the hard truth about 21st century women. Yes these characters might sound very vague and dumb in the beginning, but mind it, women like these characters exist everywhere in the world. Not to mention these four characters are unexceptionally flawed, some are lazy, do not want to work and wanna depend on their lover's filthy money to sustain them through the summers, or some are tremendously hard-working and egotistic about their jobs and constantly dominating their husbands and criticizing their jobs or some love to act paranoid or some is desperate to settle for less.

In short, this book is strictly not for serious readers, even though you are a serious reader who loves chick-lits with quality, but this book does not hold any quality instead, it has lots of SEX, and if you enjoy that, do grab a copy of this book for sure."
Four Blondes,Jeff Menter,"April 9, 2008",,"And now we have a real dilemma: how do you honestly review a book that's so bad that you didn't really finish it and you were never interested in reading it in the first place?

Candace Bushnell (of Sex and the City fame) has written a book that is either disgusting in its skewed portrayal of vapid, mindless, and spiritually bankrupt women or genius in its satirical and ironic take on selfsame.

I'm going with the former.

Perhaps it deserves some kind of recognition at the very least for the entertainment value you get from reading the harsh reviews (which are the vast majority) interspersed with the occasional fawning acclaim (another example of ironic genius?)

Let's see if I can get this 0 star to stick."
Four Blondes,Emily,"February 27, 2008",1.0,"This book is not good. It is divided into four sections about four women with barely any brains and their stories never connect. At first I felt like I was missing some big secret underlying message about society while I was reading it, but then I thought that it was just about four stupid rich women.

The writing style of the second section almost made me quit reading. Sentence length averages 6 words and every other sentence is in parentheses which I think was meant for humor but ended up being the final straw.

You can read this book in approximately 3 hours and be none the wiser. Also, the cover art is terrible. I should have known better."
Four Blondes,Jess Driscoll,"April 27, 2008",2.0,"page 166: He's sitting in the living room in a red-and-white-striped shirt, suspenders still looped over his shoulders, drinking a beer with his buddies from the network whose names I still can't be bothered to remember, when I come down the stairs, wearing a white brocade dress with grey mink trim and long grey gloves. My mother is married to a fishmonger. My father is gay and lives in Paris. I am going to the ballet."
Four Blondes,Anjanette,"May 5, 2009",5.0,"Admittedly, this book has little redeeming social value, beyond being humorous. And that said, it's probably only entertaining to readers who recognize that ""it's funny because it's true"" - even without being in the social circles of people like these characters, you would need to realize that they exist. If you must respect the protagonist in order to enjoy a book, then don't pick up this one. Leave it for those who will laugh out loud in recognition of someone they know."
Four Blondes,Meghan,"May 1, 2008",,"I purposefully didn't rate this book, because it's the worst book I have EVER read. I only finished it on principle. Awful, awful, awful. In fact, when I go to Barnes & Noble, I actually consider placing a note on the shelf that holds this book, warning people!"
Four Blondes,Kirsten (lush.lit.life),"April 19, 2021",1.0,"Okay this book is disgusting - but i was trying to get a feel for the popularity of Candace Bushnell (of sex in the city fame)without watching sex in the city. I notice most people rate this book pretty low, so i guess even fans don't like this one.

It was just creepy. High ""Ick"" factor. As in the normalization of super cringey sex ick.

However, i happened to be reading Ibsen's A Doll's House at the same time and it made a fascinating comparative study re: women's roles and what women have done with the freedoms they've fought for. Not all women of course, but some women. Hopefully fewer women than Candace Bushnell would have us believe...

So, we now have the right to eat macaroons as we please, and women from every social strata can prostitute themselves freely - yipee!

You've come a long way baby!"
Four Blondes,Candy,"May 17, 2011",4.0,Don't judge...its awesome. Very well written and easy to read :) Very different from the show.
Four Blondes,Ivana Books Are Magic,"May 31, 2016",2.0,"After absolutely hating Sex and the City, I was quite sceptic about this novel. I was pretty sure it will be as bad as her first work, but somehow it wasn't it. I was thinking how she will probably just recycle those girls from Sex and the City, but she didn't. Candice actually created brand new characters that felt very much alike. I found that anorexic princess character rather fascinating! Even after all this time ( I read this one a long time ago), I still can remember clearly all the characters. These 4 blonds were quite unique. This book seemed up to a good start, but by the time I finished it, I already felt rather tired of it. It might have been a good book.

The problem is that Candice still doesn't know how to write. Novel is something that is beyond her writing range. Maybe a short story would be more up her alley....or would it? Short stories are not as easy as they might seem. Anyway, I was somewhat pleasently surprised by this book in the sense I expected it to be a complex mess, but it wasn't it. What was it was something I would call ok. Not good. Not great...just ok. You see this book was pretty shallow as well. I can't say that I liked it. I didn't hated it, though. Perhaps some day she will learn how to write. Who knows? Miracles can happen."

Four Blondes,Kelly,"June 25, 2008",1.0,"Before I launch into another diatribe about the enormous amount of crap that is this book, let me say that chick-lit CAN be smart, it can be fun and it can YES PLEASE have a protagonist that, while interested in dating and mating, isn't obsessed over it or derive ALL of her self-esteem from it.
...the problem is that's ALL this novel is about. I get the Sex and the City thing- I even loved the show for the first few seasons before they became walking cliches of superficiality and excess, but that's exactly what this book is about.
Spare yourself this or any of Bushnell's tripe and go read some Marian Keyes."
Four Blondes,Jennifer,"April 4, 2017",,"Of all the bad books I have read, this is pobably the one that I can say was the worst. I actually threw it across the room after reading it because I was so disgusted. Can't even give it a star."
Four Blondes,Evelyn Cuellar,"April 7, 2020",1.0,"Reseña completa en Books FD

4 Rubias ha sido una de las peores novelas que he leído, no la recomiendo, a menos que
quieran ejercitar su brazo para lanzarlo lo más lejos posible de uno. Personajes pobres,
mal perfilados, tontos, vacíos, estúpidos, frívolos… con una narración muy dispareja en
los cuatro relatos y sin una trama real. Muy muy, muy, muy mala lectura."
Four Blondes,Lover of Fantasy Novels,"July 8, 2013",1.0,"This book took me two years to finish! I wish for the life of me I could have one positive remark on anything but truthfully this book is horrendous. I have never seen a cast that is so self-absorbed, manipulative, and downright one dimensional before in my life! There's only one character that comes to mind who might rival their superficiality.



Its sad when Gaston is considered a well-rounded character compared to these bitches.

Not only are they selfish they are a downright disgusting portrayal of women! In Bushnell's mind, all blonde haired women are either beautiful or whorish. Actually since I've used Gaston, then I might as well use the most perfect example of what these characters remind me of-



Only one of the characters was interesting to read and didn't make me want to rip my hair out. This book looks like it was written by a high school student who wanted to bash the blonde girls who picked on her.


Don't pick up this book!! Trust me, the book will bring out a feminist in you that you didn't know existed until after scanning through this monstrosity."
Four Blondes,Jaime,"July 31, 2008",1.0,Honestly...this book is probably one of the worst books I have ever read...I did not enjoy it what-so-ever...I do not watch Sex and the City (i make fun more than anything) but my friend told me this is one of her favorite books and i had to read it. I hated the way it was written...The second story I could not stand all the parentheses and the third story the intitials bothered me also...I felt that the characters kind of sucked and you really could care less about them. I also did not like how the third story mentioned some characters from the first and the second but they were not really intertwined or related...it was kind of just thrown in. I usually enjoy stories where the characters are linked and that would have redeemed this book just a little but the way she did it really just kind of annoyed me more than anything...all-in-all...I did not like this book and would not recommend it to anyone...ever
Four Blondes,Carol Storm,"July 13, 2011",3.0,"It was the best of blondes -- it was the worst of blondes.

I was never a big SEX AND THE CITY fan. As a rule I prefer romance to chick lit. I like guaranteed happy endings, and I also prefer a more hopeful take on men than what you get from most literary or ""feminist"" fiction.

The point is, I approached 4 BLONDES with really low expectations. Yet it wasn't quite as bad as I expected. Some of the satire on career women and feminists is razor sharp. Bushnell really shows how ""educated"" white women from schools like Barnard and Wellesley sneer at minorities while aping their victim rhetoric. They use the language of victims while fighting not for equality but for the privileges of white male aristocrats. (One part where the ""smart"" heroine is shocked because on AMAZON anyone can trash a book by an ""important"" feminist author left me smiling for days.)

On the other hand, as irreverent and clear-sighted as Candace Bushnell can be about important things, there's also a certain amount of silliness and snobbery that seems to come directly from the author, not the characters. For example, there's a whole story about a fashion model with no work skills and no formal education at all who is ""shocked"" that her equally brainless baby sister would marry a rock star -- because supposedly rock stars are ""beneath"" jet-set fashion models. The problem is, Bushnell knows nothing about rock and roll, indeed nothing about music, and never allows ""Digger"" to speak for himself. In real life, a tough boy like Jim Morrison or Eminem would have ripped Jane's lungs out -- even a drippy mama's boy like Elvis Presley or Kurt Cobain would have managed a put down or two. Yet in this book the rock star and his just-off-the-farm parents are supposed to be ""terrified"" of their brittle, artificial jet-set mother-in-law.

As my Depression-raised, Harlem-born grandfather used to say, ""aw, who's gonna believe this?""

Put Ma Joad up against Lily Bart in a fist fight (or even just a catfight) and it's not Ma Joad who's going to the hospital.

When she wants to be, Candace Bushnell can be one smart cookie. But the rest of the time she's just a product whore pain in the ass."
Four Blondes,Madeline Lund,"April 17, 2013",4.0,"The protagonists of these stories are connected not only by their blonde hair but also by their isolation and desire for change. While each story can certainly stand alone, the author, Candace Bushnell, shows why she published them in one collection. Some of her characters exist in more than one of the stories. Bushnell does this to show that everyone, both in her stories and in the real wold, is connected in some way. These women may never meet, but they could. These stories could in fact be real. In some way, they are. Bushnell uses these stories to give readers an inside look at the lives of the wealthy and the elite. She shows us that no matter who you are you can be dissatisfied with life but she also shows us that it is never too late to make a change for the better.

While I might not become friends with any of these women if I met them in person, Bushnell has the ability to make me feel sadness for what these girls have to endure. She makes me want good things to happen for them.

I look forward to reading more of her work, and I highly recommend these stories. I must add that these stories do describe vulgar acts in vulgar language, but everything Bushnell writes is necessary. She simply writes what her characters do. The thoughts and actions of her characters cause these stories to be for mature audiences only."
Four Blondes,Love Fool,"August 5, 2014",2.0,"In her first book since the cultural phenomenon Sex and the City, Candace Bushnell triumphantly returned with the national best-seller Four Blondes, which The New York Times says ""chronicles the glittering lives of semicelebrities, social aspirants, and moneyed folk ...

WTF did I just read? Candace Bushnell, I know Manhattan has some vain and money/career driven people living there but please, let's not scare anyone away. I feel like I should be ashamed to live and love NYC. Yes, we are the city that loves money, hot careers, and hard to get into restaurants but we do have a heart.

I felt like the stories were getting more boring and stupider as I was reading. She makes it seem like marriage is this horrible event that you force upon yourself and only stay married for social status. Maybe, I'm not rich or posh enough to relate to this book. Also, I never had more WTF moments while reading a book.

When I read these kinds of books, I wonder how they get published."
Four Blondes,Stephanie,"July 27, 2007",1.0,"I only gave this 1 star because it was an easy read and I will admit a line or two was funny, however, it was hard for me to give it 1. The main reason I bought it was because it was written by the author of Sex and the City and I thought it was going to be interesting or at least follow characters that were similar to the ones in the TV series but I was dead wrong. I kept reading only hoping (assuming) that at some point it may get interesting. The book should be called 4 dumb blondes. It’s NOT a novel like I expected, its set up as short stories (none of which end up being connected) that follow 4 woman who are basically complaining the whole time about the bad choices they made in their lives. In my opinion you should only read this if you are one an airplane or in a car with nothing better to do."
Four Blondes,Yrinsyde,"October 19, 2009",3.0,"Lots of negative reviews about this novel by Bushnell. I am wondering though - it isn't bad writing. Bushnell reminds me strongly of William S Burroughs. He writes of the real dirty urban world full of unhappiness but gleams of light shine through. Sometimes it makes your stomach turn, but both write with 'this is how the world is, or at least - my world' with brief, to the point statements. Both are not overly descriptive - my husband says this is in the tradition of American literature. 4 Blondes is saddening - but for someone who also reads fashion magazines, I can understand the vapid meaningless world that some have manufactured for the joy of some and the woe of others. Being an editor of Vogue, Bushnell has seen the underbelly and is writing out her experiences."
Four Blondes,Mati,"November 26, 2007",3.0,"I was hard in to the TV series Sex and the City and when I hear d about Candace Bushnell, I decided to read more books from her. I bought the 4 Blondes and I was not disappointed the style was crisp and very observing. The four women had one thing in common they are relatively rich and very beautiful, however it is not much in the city jungle, where you can always find someone younger and more beautiful. Life suck and it is even worse when main heroines are selfish and self obsessed. It is fine book if you look at it as whole, but when you try to take it in to the pieces and think about it too much it started to be dull and over cliched."
Four Blondes,Laila,"June 15, 2007",1.0,"I like watching Sex and the City, a funny and interesting television show about four female friends and their love lives in the city. This book, however, is dreadful. I had a hard time getting through it. The characters and stories are not funny nor are they in any way interesting. You don't care about the characters, but almost sort of want them to wander into city traffic and get run over. Luckily I borrowed this from the library and didn't actually squander any of my hard-earned money on it."
Four Blondes,Shauna Mulligan,"May 8, 2007",2.0,"Good? Eh. Entertaining? Mostly. This book was like reading an episode of Sex and the City, except that the characters are less fun, more emotionally messed up and often married. They do have similar taste in shoes, drink a lot of cocktails and talk about sex a lot. It was a quick read -- good for the beach, airplane or anywhere you won't be embarrassed to be seen reading it."
Four Blondes,Cynthia,"February 28, 2015",1.0,If I could give this book NO stars I would but it is not an option. I actually threw it away halfway through it. Bought it at library book sale for a quarter and that's too much money.
Four Blondes,Mitch,"July 26, 2015",1.0,I think I lost IQ points reading that.
Four Blondes,Jamie Spence,"April 1, 2016",1.0,Garbage. That's all that needs to be said.
Four Blondes,Amie,"June 7, 2014",3.0,"Janey is selfish, but she is far from simple. Her mother is a French bitch and at some point, in Trading Up, the story goes into how she's more fucked up than we thought, that she was on a yacht with this Arab guy that basically paid her to have sex. I mean, hello? You have to be pretty damaged to be so detached, so divorced from yourself and whoever you used to be that you are actually okay with meaningless sex and getting paid for it. Janey has issues, a lot of them, and yes, as I said, she is selfish, but all of Bushnell's characters are complex, even if not directly. In this book, Janey tries to convince herself that she doesn't need a guy to live the life she wants (a glamorous one, with a house in the Hamptons in the summer) and she almost convinces herself that she is independent because she's going places, writing a script for some douche bag who pays for a summer house for her. She almost fools herself into thinking that she's something, that she has love, but then he shows up with his wife and Janey goes back to being the Janey that we got to know at first--she doesn't really show any emotion, she recedes into her selfish behaviors and fools herself into thinking that she might do something--anything--someday and be famous, rich. fabulous.

The second story is also complex. Winnie is a type A character and marries a man because she wants everything to be perfect in her life. And when he doesn't seem perfect, she can't handle it and he can't handle being criticized and at the end, he has sex with some chick that works with his wife and Winnie sleeps with a movie star, Tanner, because it's freeing. James thinks Winnie is joking when he tells her, probably because it's so out of character for her to do that and he's too much of a pussy to tell her that he fooled around with that other girl. So their relationship frailly goes on existing because neither one of them knows how to properly communicate with one another and it's just really sad. In the end, though, Winnie actually says something nice to James, about his work and it's like sleeping with other people might have actually fixed (or helped) their fucked up life. It's a story about types of people and control/power in relationships, which, any reader with sense could see is a very delicate thing to write about (well) and that the characters aren't boring at all. Maybe these people picked up this book expecting erotica on every other page and were sad to see that this book is both about love and about how love isn't enough or fades or can be really, really shitty at times.

The third story was really interesting, about a girl who becomes a princess after marrying some prince guy. Meaning that she has to deal with the media hounding her and in the beginning, she is horribly depressed. And can't leave the house, can't do anything because of how things are, how her life is. And her husband is bleakly absent. He keeps his emotions concealed and she is learning just how hard it is to be married to someone in the public eye. I think there's a lot more to this story than it at first seems and it was actually very interesting to read because she suffers from insane paranoia and possibly killed someone (and is friends with a complete psycho lady, but that character is a nice foil to help Cecelia (the princess) get over some of her issues).

The last story was decent, but not great. It was piece-y and felt like Bushnell was just throwing in old ""Sex and the City"" material because she had some extra lying around. It was sort of lame for that reason, but the ending was pretty great. She leaves England, sad that she has to leave a man behind who has just told her that he loves her. She thinks that the sensible thing to do is to go back to New York without him, leaving him behind, possibly missing her chance at a marriage, at love, etc.

The last bit that really was good in the book was this bit:

God, I was so fickle. I'd left Rory only two hours ago, and already I was thinking about another man.

What was it I wanted?

The story.

I wanted the story. I wanted the big, great, inspiring story about an unmarried career woman who goes to London on assignment and meets the man of her dreams and marries him. She gets the big ring and the big house and the adorable children, and she lives happily ever after. But stories are not reality, no matter how much we might wish them so.

And that's not so bad.

And then, because it would be too bad ass to end the book on that note, Bushnell has this character meet the love of her life on the flight back home. I was actually getting kind of excited about how it might end with an unmarried, single woman at the end, but oh, well. I'm glad there was that point of clarity sticking through at the end, though. I almost felt okay not ever getting married or whatever.

I think the best thing that can be taken away from reading Bushnell is that she is, in fact, trying to honestly chronicle how shitty it feels to run around looking for love, looking for sex, looking for a non-jerk and having that ever-persistent feeling, that, in the end, you might not have your best friend waking up next to you every morning. She does a very good job at looking at women, at society and talking candidly about what's going on. I agree with the aforementioned comment about Bushnell being the twenty-first century's Jane Austen and I applaud her for at least TRYING to be honest and not just writing cheesy bodice-ripping stories that ladies read to get off on love and sex or whatever. I like reading real stuff because people aren't characters and at least Bushnell is paying dues to the fact that people (and relationships, love, etc) are complicated and not easily unwound in a happy-go-lucky type of book where the girl just falls in love (like we knew she would and expected she would)."
Four Blondes,Maria Luciotti,"February 5, 2022",2.0,"I thought this would be a flirty and fun book, but it turned out to be very abrasive and abrubt. The book blurb revealed that the author would chronicle the lives of four women, but I didn't realize that meant the book consisted of four mini stories. None of the characters are written in a way that allowed me to relate to or sympathize with them -- quite frankly the women were classless, disturbed, and frustrating in many ways. Since the book was divided into these mini stories, it felt like each was rushed, and none of the endings were at all satisfying. I kept reading in hopes of something that would ""draw howls of recognition"", but that never came. Each story became shorter until the last woman was left with a mere 33 pages."
Four Blondes,Emily,"November 8, 2018",2.0,"I actually remember reading this years ago and going through the worst rated titles on goodreads the awful book springs back to my mind. I love sex in the city or sex and the city whatever universe your from, so I gave this a go. I picked it up in a charity shop so many years ago because of the author and it was just terrible, I mean I was really young but still I was young enough the realise how self absorbed these characters are and how dull this book was as well. Generally awful and so much body shaming and really bad ideals which could really harm a reader. It’s just trash."
Four Blondes,Linda Delapp,"April 20, 2022",2.0,"So disappointing...expected more from Candace Bushnell! I am a fan of her books usually, but this book with 4 stories was a waste of my time.

Four Blondes,Sarah,"June 28, 2022",3.0,"Fascinating and depressing reading a book that was published twenty-two years ago whose major themes are still relevant today. Objectification of women, how society weaponizes women's sexuality and uses it against them, the unequal distribution of household chores and child rearing duties in straight marriage...the list goes on. This book is also very funny and Bushnell writes about NYC and its social stratagem like no one else."

To Train Up a Child,Spider the Doof Warrior,"September 17, 2014",1.0,"Uh, no. This isn't a good book. It seems to forget that babies and children are in fact babies and children and they are not plotting against you.
When a baby bites its mother's breasts, it's not doing it out of malice, so why pull their hair? Why not stop the kid from nursing and then start again? Why is it necessary to inflict pain on a child that small?
This book advices switching starting at the age of four months. Why?
You mean to tell me that rather than taking your guns and putting them in high places, child proofing your house, not allowing sharp objects where your kid can get them you have to switch them instead? Why is that necessary?
This is the sort of person who makes Christians look bad and makes atheists what to stay atheists.
The good thing is he recommends spending time with your kids, teaching them, showing them love, but you know what? You can do that without hitting them with PCV pipes and thin sticks. I say throw all of that stuff out of the window and realize that these kids are KIDS. Beating them isn't going to keep them from becoming crooks when they can barely talk, let alone walk.

It isn't anything BUT abuse if you're being a child with plumbing line and it causes kidney damage. Anyone who would do this to a horse or a dog deserves jail and being kicked and bitten, but to do this to a child, you should NEVER be allowed to get out of prison. Also check what No Longer Qivering has to say about the Pearls and their family destroying methods."
To Train Up a Child,Ellen,"November 21, 2013",1.0,"This book is truly monstrous.

I have seen positive reviews that cite the fact that Pearl promotes relationship-building, and point to that as a counterbalance to the spanking. People who love the book seem to want us to believe that, because so much of the book is about kindness, that it somehow ""cancels out"" the ""small"" amount of violence.

But I find that one of the most terrifying things about it.

The juxtaposition of ""loving"" content, religious content, Pearl's bizarrely jolly tone, and the passages on hitting/beating/whipping/spanking/switching is what makes the whole so chilling.

In the Pearls' system, the same people expecting your love, telling you they love you, and being kind at times, are the ones who might do something as bizarre as setting you up with a temptation (or giving a ridiculous order) just to let you fail, so you can be hit. They may even cause pain due to your doing something perfectly innocent.

And these people aren't bosses, spouses or even prison guards, working this manipulation on adults. They are doing this to tiny babies and children who have never known anything else.

The people defining all of life (and I do mean all -- many children being raised this way are also not exposed to outsiders) are not to be trusted -- their love brings pain, and they are calm and controlled when causing it.

They firmly believe, as they administer pain:

- that the problem is clearly the child's fault.
- that this mind-twisting, illogical cruelty is Godly.
- that the trickery, forced adversarial situations and need to win at all costs, even if by violence, is how to show love to a child.
- that all babies and children are brimming over with sin, and that they are saving these children from a fiery hell.

And they go right back to being blithely sweet after confusing and hurting their children.

What a nightmare.

The ""it's all about love, most of the book is not about spanking"" junk is what makes it sly torture, rather than garden-variety meanness. It's not a guideline for raising a healthy, autonomous adult -- it's a recipe for a brainwashed prisoner locked into the Stockholm Syndrome.

And that brainwashed person may continue to believe the upside-down definition of ""love"" with which they grew up, especially if told that it was mandated by God!

Which leads me to another myth promoted by people who love this book -- that the Pearls' children are doing well. Everything I've read about them, and from them, points to the opposite.

Granted, that opinion may be colored by my view that choosing one's life, beliefs and work (and being educated enough to make those choices and survive in the real world) are important to happiness. But I am certainly not alone in that opinion.

Another myth that springs up in the positive reviews, and in the book, is that there is no middle ground between parents who set no boundaries, then end up screaming and flailing, and parents like the Pearls.

I've been in education for over 40 years, and know hundreds and hundreds of parents, most of whom do just fine setting limits, teaching morals and self-control, and raising happy, well-behaved children, without resorting to the weird, cruel methods of the Pearls. I find that ""these kids today"" in this secular world are mostly fine people.

This book is a vicious attack on innocent children, a perversion of Christian beliefs, and a filthy thing to do to well-meaning parents frightened of failing.

I think it's important to read the whole book in order to express an opinion. Don't give the Pearls your money, though -- here:"
To Train Up a Child,Misfit,"June 18, 2015",,I can't believe that a book that encourages child abuse is allowed on the market and has been tied to one couple accused of killing their two adopted children by the *parenting* methods in this book.
To Train Up a Child,Beth,"October 29, 2007",1.0,"This is one of the most horrific, abusive books I have EVER read. This is a how-too book on child abuse. Impressionable Christian parents are most vulnerable. This book is disgusting and dangerous to our children and puts their wellbeing and lives in danger. Educating yourself on the true meaning of the Bible's rod verses and God's grace will show you that this book is not ok with God's plan. In fact the church that the Pearls were associated with have since taken a stand against this book and do not endorse it at all.

To train up a child in the way he should goes should not mean using behavior modification, giving repeated switchings, practicing adversarial tactics, demanding instant compliance, and silencing the voice our our children. It's time to speak up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
To Train Up a Child,Ellen,"November 21, 2013",1.0,"This book is truly monstrous.

I have seen positive reviews that cite the fact that Pearl promotes relationship-building, and point to that as a counterbalance to the spanking. People who love the book seem to want us to believe that, because so much of the book is about kindness, that it somehow ""cancels out"" the ""small"" amount of violence.

But I find that one of the most terrifying things about it.

The juxtaposition of ""loving"" content, religious content, Pearl's bizarrely jolly tone, and the passages on hitting/beating/whipping/spanking/switching is what makes the whole so chilling.

In the Pearls' system, the same people expecting your love, telling you they love you, and being kind at times, are the ones who might do something as bizarre as setting you up with a temptation (or giving a ridiculous order) just to let you fail, so you can be hit. They may even cause pain due to your doing something perfectly innocent.

And these people aren't bosses, spouses or even prison guards, working this manipulation on adults. They are doing this to tiny babies and children who have never known anything else.

The people defining all of life (and I do mean all -- many children being raised this way are also not exposed to outsiders) are not to be trusted -- their love brings pain, and they are calm and controlled when causing it.

They firmly believe, as they administer pain:

- that the problem is clearly the child's fault.
- that this mind-twisting, illogical cruelty is Godly.
- that the trickery, forced adversarial situations and need to win at all costs, even if by violence, is how to show love to a child.
- that all babies and children are brimming over with sin, and that they are saving these children from a fiery hell.

And they go right back to being blithely sweet after confusing and hurting their children.

What a nightmare.

The ""it's all about love, most of the book is not about spanking"" junk is what makes it sly torture, rather than garden-variety meanness. It's not a guideline for raising a healthy, autonomous adult -- it's a recipe for a brainwashed prisoner locked into the Stockholm Syndrome.

And that brainwashed person may continue to believe the upside-down definition of ""love"" with which they grew up, especially if told that it was mandated by God!

Which leads me to another myth promoted by people who love this book -- that the Pearls' children are doing well. Everything I've read about them, and from them, points to the opposite.

Granted, that opinion may be colored by my view that choosing one's life, beliefs and work (and being educated enough to make those choices and survive in the real world) are important to happiness. But I am certainly not alone in that opinion.

Another myth that springs up in the positive reviews, and in the book, is that there is no middle ground between parents who set no boundaries, then end up screaming and flailing, and parents like the Pearls.

I've been in education for over 40 years, and know hundreds and hundreds of parents, most of whom do just fine setting limits, teaching morals and self-control, and raising happy, well-behaved children, without resorting to the weird, cruel methods of the Pearls. I find that ""these kids today"" in this secular world are mostly fine people.

This book is a vicious attack on innocent children, a perversion of Christian beliefs, and a filthy thing to do to well-meaning parents frightened of failing.

This is referenced from the above article.
Some of the discipline techniques the Pearls teach include:

Using plastic tubing to beat children, since it hurts a lot but leaves fewer marks to alert authorities
Wearing the plastic tubing around the parent's neck as a constant reminder to obey
""Swatting"" babies as young as six months old with instruments such as ""a 12-inch willowy branch,"" thinner plastic tubing or a wooden spoon
""Blanket training"" babies by hitting them with an instrument if they try to crawl off a blanket on the floor
Beating older children with rulers, paddles, belts and larger tree branches
""Training"" children with pain before they even disobey, in order to teach total obedience
Giving cold water baths, putting children outside in cold weather and withholding meals as discipline
Hosing off children who have potty training accidents
Inflicting punishment until a child is ""without breath to complain.""

To Train Up a Child,Louisa,"November 21, 2013",,"Guys, spread the word. This is the actual WORST. It literally advocates child abuse, neglect and torture through corporal punishment. It's been linked to the deaths of three children. Parents buy into this crap because it's couched as ""Christian parenting"". What a fucking blight on my religion this is, like the Westboro Baptist Church.

Quoted directly from the book:

I believe the parents are entirely responsible for their own behavior. Of course, they're obviously stupid, irrational, & ripe for the picking of such con men as the Pearl's, but none of that is excuse enough to torture children to death.

I don't like convicting books or people without some background, so I checked out their FB page & didn't think they sounded too far out. Very religious, possibly even Fundamentalists, but a lot of otherwise decent people are. Then I checked out some of the reviews on Amazon. Several went into detail that convinced me the article was not blown out of proportion. This book does promote child abuse. This one was the best:

I think after reviewing my love for books about beating children is fairly well known, so imagine my excitement when I came across this book which recommends beating children as young as 9 months old with sticks and justifies it by claiming Jesus wants you to beat the shit out of your infant.





Fucking awesome!"
To Train Up a Child,Sondre,"November 4, 2013",1.0,"I have no bloody idea how anybody can give this book anything but a scathing review. The contents of the book are abhorrent and horrible on every level. That it has 3.5 stars on this webpage as of this review scares the everloving crap out of me.

Some examples from the book: A child disobeys his father for not wanting to sit in his lap, and what does the father do? Spanks the child for 45 minutes straight. If your baby bites your nipple while nursing you should yank the babies hair. They teach that children acting like children (running around, squabbling over toys etc) is because their mother didn't conquer their minds by repeatedly beating them. It also compares these parents to Holocaust victims on their way to concentration camps

Not only is the book a horrible book, but the consequences of the torture of children is obvious: parents following the ""teachings"" of this book have killed their children. In one case the mother smothered her child causing it to suffocate. A seven year old was whipped to death by her parents. And lastly a adopted girl was beaten and starved to death by her parents. These parents were following what this book teaches. Anybody who reads this and thinks it is acceptable should not be parents. Shame on you."
To Train Up a Child,Anita Dalton,"September 3, 2013",1.0,"This is one of the wickedest books I have ever read and, given who I am and what I read, that is saying a lot. This is a book so vile, written by a man so degenerate, that there is literally no way for a moral person to discuss it with anything approaching neutrality. It is a book written solely with the intent of breaking the wills of small children, beating them into submission, and it has become a text used by witless Christian parents to beat their “willful” children to death. And Michael Pearl is okay with that because he says those parents didn’t beat their children with love in their hearts or they wouldn’t have struck their children repeatedly with plumbing line until their muscles broke down and clogged their kidneys with biological debris, killing them.

This book is deeply problematic beyond just the content, which we will get to in a moment. This book upsets me so much because though I am an atheist, I know excellent and fine Christians. My grandfather was one. He would have rebuked a man like Michael Pearl and if Pearl beat a child or a dog with a piece of wood, a belt, or plumbing line in front of him, Pearl would have found out what it is like to be at the mercy of a larger, angry man. That is not because my grandfather was some sort of vengeance seeker. Far from it. He was not a man who looked for fights. He would have rebuked Pearl because genuine believers cannot stomach the harms done by True Believers. Many Christians today have the same reactions to the Westboro Baptist Church. This book is so deeply problematic because in fundamentalist, legalistic circles, people use this book in the place of their own judgement as Christians, parents and decent human beings.

This is not a condemnation of Christianity. It is a condemnation of Christians who use Michael and Debi Pearl’s disgusting book of abuse, a book so profoundly horrible that if it was used against prisoners it would be illegal and if it was used on POWs it would be considered war crimes. So if you want to defend Christianity, don’t do it here. Christianity is not what is being discussed here. What is being discussed here is child abuse in the name of Michael Pearl, not God or Jesus, and the way that unthinking faith leads people to do terrible things.

The purpose of To Train Up a Child is to use Amish horse training methods on children, and even then the Amish would likely turn their backs on Pearl if they knew how their methods of taming wild animals were used on children.

Don’t get lost in the details. Pearl in Chapter One lays out a bunch of explanations of how it is that he is not disciplining children, but rather continually training them so he does not have to discipline them. He uses Proverbs 22:6 as his rationale:

Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.

Fair enough, but when “training” consists of pulling a nursing infant’s hair, hitting them continually, deliberately putting them in harm’s way to show them they must obey all commands, even those that make zero sense on any rational level, hitting them if they do not obey quickly enough for your satisfaction, what you are doing is brainwashing your child to follow your demented ideas, not any sort of Godly path. Mindless, shattered, fearful automatons will never depart from the path you put them on."
To Train Up a Child,Victoria Carrington,"August 17, 2013",1.0,"Please Christian parents- remember that you have direct access to the throne of grace for your time of need through JesuscChrist. Pray and ask God directly how you should train up your kids in the way they should go. God will give wisdom liberally to those who ask. Jesus left us a legacy of how he treated children which is written in the Gospels.

We serve a God of unfathomable love and grace toward even the most unworthy among us. How dare we listen to a book that advises us to treat children as animals, not as precious, helpless, dependent beings created in the image of God?

Have these authors forgotten their own hopeless state from which Jesus (hopefully) has rescued them? How do they regard teachings of Jesus about kindness even toward enemies and then deliberately hurt those entrusted to our care?

Non- Christians, do not blame Jesus for this mess and know that most true followers of the living Jesus Christ who resides in our hearts would never""train"" our children in such a cruel way."

I'm a survivor of Pearl-type teachings. Their formulas do NOT create ""emotionally stable"" children, as the Pearls claim. Instead, they create robots. They talk about creating ""bonds"" with your children, while at the same time advocating breaking your children. Here are some direct quotes from this book:

""...if you are just beginning to institute training on an already rebellious child, who runs from discipline and is too incoherent to listen, then use whatever force is necessary to bring him to bay. If you have to sit on him to spank him then do not hesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered. Prove that you are bigger, tougher, more patiently enduring and are unmoved by his wailing. Defeat him totally. Accept no conditions for surrender. No compromise. You are to rule over him as a benevolent sovereign. Your word is final.""

""A general rule is to continue the disciplinary action until the child is surrendered."""
To Train Up a Child,Rachel,"December 1, 2011",1.0,"Will write a complete review later.

Ok. If this review isn't in my typically balanced and calm style, there's a reason. I hate this book. I hate what the authors stand for and how it has destroyed lives. I hate the mindset that demands parents ""break a child's will"".

I don't have a copy of this book, so I'm not going to be able to give you a page number. Many other reviewers do offer in-depth critiques of the book complete with quotes and page numbers.

The Pearls believe that children are inherently evil, rebellious, and conniving - from infanthood! Got a six-month-old who cries to be picked up after being put down to bed? Spank him and ignore his lonely cries. Don't give in to this child's will or - what horror, that a child could convince his own parents to hold him.

To summarize their view on corporal punishment, they suggest the following methods:

1. Spanking/whipping with a rod, a switch from a tree, a cord from a weed-eater, or a 1/4 INCH PIECE OF PLUMBING LINE. They even suggest hanging the plumbing line around the neck as a constant reminder to the children that the parent is ready to beat them for the tiniest infraction.

2. Continuing to beat the child until the parent/s are satisfied they have broken down the child's will. (At this point, why do the Pearls bother hiding the truth behind the word ""spank""? This is nothing less than a beating).

3. Sitting on the child to restrain him/her during the beating if necessary.

4. They suggest using ""swats"" to train babies as young as 4 months not to climb on stairs, touch the stove, etc. At this point, the child hasn't done anything wrong. The parent simply waits for them to reach out to the stairs (or whatever item is being used as an excuse for this sadistic behavior), says, ""No"", and smacks the child. Repeat until child is afraid of the stairs, the stove, or the tempting toy the parent *intentionally* put out as bait. Obviously, a common sense solution like a child gate at the stairs just won't work. Keeping an eye on your kid so s/he doesn't get burned on the stove? That's for sissies*. No, the only want to properly train a child is to hit him/her until the child's will (or sense of self) is broken.

Michael Pearl may not be legally responsible for the deaths of Sean Paddock, Lydia Schatz, or Hana Williams, but he is responsible for the despicable abuse manual I've reviewed here.

*Michael Pearl seems to see ""sissy"" as a term of contempt for those he views as too weak-minded to carry out the abuse he prescribes. I have a few words for him:

Abuser - He hits kids repeatedly. That's a good enough definition for me, and probably for any kids who've suffered because of his methods.
Sadist - He mentions smiling/laughing, etc. when chasing children in order to beat them.
Manipulator - He suggests orchestrating scenarios to give parents an excuse to have a ""training session"".

Worst of all, he's someone who wants to convince other parents to embody these qualities.

To Train Up a Child,Rob Finking,"November 18, 2013",1.0,"This is horrendous and evil. What makes it so vile is that it is presented as nice and loving. It reminds me of Umbridge (from Harry Potter) - pink and fluffy and happy to torture children.

To Train Up a Child,Erin Wilson,"October 16, 2011",1.0,"Would never, EVER recommend this book. Not only is it the epitome of lazy parenting, it's dangerous. Three adopted children have died from this, and I don't doubt that many more children, adopted or otherwise, have developed phobias and various other anxiety problems. The result of these teachings are joyless, broken children, not children with any sort of enthusiasm for the Lord or life at all. Children, selfish as they may be, are simply looking to satisfy their down desires, not test or manipulate the parent. Children are not animals to be ""trained""- and indeed, if anyone trained their animals that way it would be illegal and considered abusive. I truly hope that creating robots was not the intention of Mike and Debi Pearl, and especially not the intention of anyone who actually follows their potentially lethal advice.

Mike Pearl also makes several errors in LOGIC in this book. He claims that game wardens will allow fishers to catch only 5 fish, but penalize them if they catch 6, and many parents make this error of allowing ""chances"" before actually using appropriate punishment. Um, no, 5 is the maximum amount of fish someone can catch, and if they take 6 they are taking more than their fair share. This is not at all related to children being allowed to break rules before the parents step in. There is nothing inherently illegal in catching fish, but there is in catching more than the allowed amount. Wouldn't that be more like a child being allowed 5 pieces of candy, but not 6? Come on. There are more errors in logic, but that's the one that stood out.

What's more about this horrible book is that the theology is dodgy and the Scriptural backup very shaky. The Pearls follow a VERY literal interpretation of the Bible, and fail to comprehend that there may be more meaning. On top of that, they throw around typical Christian buzzwords, but actually seldom use Scripture while claiming that all of their teachings are Biblically sound. They are not sound at all, and they mostly use logical fallacies and appeal to emotions to reach readers. I dare say God would not approve."

That is not even touching on the subject of the mind games they are suggesting you play with your children. IF hitting them does not work wear a plastic tube around your neck to they will always remember that you could beat them at any moment. CHILDREN are NOT DOGS! There are other parenting books out there that do not condone mental abuse, give advice on how to beat your child without leaving marks (?!WHA!!?) or result in your child's death if your 'interpret' the message incorrectly.

The couple writing this show a clear lack of empathy for not only children, but all others - how anyone can calmly write about beating a 4 month old child on the bare legs with a 12 inch piece of wood is beyond me.

To Train Up a Child,Sue,"January 8, 2009",1.0,This book is dangerous.
To Train Up a Child,Christina,"November 19, 2013",1.0,"If I could give this less than one star I would. I read this book because I thought it couldn't possibly be as bad as people were saying. It is worse than I ever imagined. Pearl seems to think that he can use double talk to trick the reader into thinking they are not harming their child by following his technique. He makes a big deal about saying that he is training his children not disciplining them, but then he uses training in a way that it become synonymous to spanking. In addition, he liberally uses love and patience in word but not in deed.

As an educator, I find this book disturbing. I've taken enough psychology classes to know that the ""training"" described in this book will not result in happy, obedient children. It will likely result in fearful, depressed children, but that is not the worse of it. As we have already seen in the news, it could also result in a dead, innocent child.

Although I do not personally believe there is ever a good reason for spanking a child, I do not think that all spanking is abuse. My issue with Pearl's training is the various ways that it crosses the line. He proposes switching babies for reaching for a forbidden object and pulling the hair of infants who bite while nursing. Responding to naturally occurring situations isn't enough. He also proposes creating situations to give your children opportunities to submitting to your will. He doesn't even seem to know his own mind. In one instance he claims that babies are smart enough to manipulate their parents, but in the next they are not old enough to understand reason. They can only understand pain. That is just plain sick. Babies aren't capable of manipulation. The damage that can be done at this tender age far outweighs any benefit. They are developing trust, exploring their environment, and learning to try new things. Hitting them will only stifle their development.

Even absolute obedience will not save a child from the switch in Pearl's eyes. They must also have the right attitude while obeying without delay. Children must always be cheerful and obedient. That is just setting them up for failure. They are people not robots. Furthermore denying a child basic elements of survival (food, clothing, shelter, love) under any circumstances is abuse. Disgustingly, Pearl seems to have no problem restricting them as means of ""training.""

As a Christian, I find this book deplorable. Pearl likes to refer to ""the rod of correction."" He doesn't even stop to think that the ""rod"" that most people would be familiar with during the time that the Bible was written was a Shepherd's rod. Shepherds use their rods to guide their sheep, not beat them into submission. Jesus represents love and forgiveness. Nowhere in Scripture does he advocate child abuse. Pearl also uses the Scripture reference ""For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth."" I guess he doesn't have access to a dictionary because he thinks that chastise means to spank. It actually
means to verbally punish.

The only true statement I found in the book was, ""If nothing else, training will result in saving you time."" Yes, it takes far less time to destroy than it takes to build. But at what cost? Following the advice of this book has the potential to destroy our nation's most precious asset--our children and our future."
To Train Up a Child,Camille,"November 19, 2013",1.0,"I get so sad when I see the 'Christian Parenting' excuse for the child abuse advocated in this book.

As a Christ follower and a parent, I want to show my kids God's love, teach them God's ways, equip them with the wisdom to know God's path for them, and the courage to follow it. So let's chuck out all the hear-say and see what the Bible, God's word teaches:

Matthew 7:12:
So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. (NIV 2011)
Galatians 5:22-25:
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. (NIV 2011)
1 Corinthians 13:4-8
""Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails."" (NIV 2011)
1 John 4:8
Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. (NIV 2011)
Mark 10:13-16:
One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could touch and bless them. But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him. When Jesus saw what was happening, he was angry with his disciples. He said to them, “Let the children come to me. Don’t stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children. I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn’t receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.” Then he took the children in his arms and placed His hands on their heads and blessed them. (NLT 2007)
Matthew 18:6
If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. (NIV 2011)

The Bible teaches that 'the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control' (Galatians 5:22-25). God tells us to 'keep in step with the Spirit' by living the fruit of the Spirit, not just when we go to church on Sundays, but everyday, perhaps most importantly, in our homes, as an example to our children.

God tells us that He is love, and he teaches us that ""love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails."" (1 Corinthians 13:4-8) God expects us to model this love, His love, to our children.

God gave us Jesus, His Child, to model and teach us His ways. Jesus values children (Mark 10:13-16), He values them A LOT. He does not treat them like 2nd class citizens that need to be disciplined and scolded into submission and conformation. Jesus got upset when His disciples wanted to send the children away. Jesus adjusted His schedule and made time for the children. He delighted in them. We need to follow Jesus's example.

God expects us to train up our children in His ways not just by teaching them how to act and do and behave, but, more importantly, by modelling God's ways, as Jesus did for me.

If I want my child to be a loving person I need to treat him with love. If I want him to be a joyful person I need to show him joy. If I want him to be peaceful, I need to be at peace myself. If I want to instill kindness, goodness and faithfulness in him, I need to treat him with kindness, goodness and faithfulness.

And if I want him to grow up to be a gentle man, with self control, I need to be gentle with him and with others, because he is part of, learns from, and mimics my daily social interactions with him and with others.

Of course this is a massive responsibility and all of this is impossible to do without God's help. And I must admit that I fall short dramatically when it comes to modelling the fruit of the Spirit all the time, but I do try, and try again. I follow my Leader with joy, knowing that He will not reject me when I fall and get up and try again, just as I will not reject my son Etienne.

My point is that the Bible teaches love. Not fear, anger, and child abuse. Love. A love that is patient, kind, is not proud, does not dishonour others, is not self-seeking, is not easily angered, keeps no record of wrongs. A love that always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. A Love that never fails. (1 Corinthians 13:4-8)"
To Train Up a Child,Adrienne,"May 30, 2007",5.0,This is a great book for learning to be proactive instead of reactive in child training. Teach them when they are young..if you wait it will be harder on you and your child.
To Train Up a Child,Lady,"January 15, 2008",1.0,ooh where to start. This book perpetuates child abuse and domination. It is inacurate at best.
To Train Up a Child,Tamara,"April 28, 2013",1.0,"To Train Up a Child is an extremely poor book for parenting advise. This is ABUSE, not parenting. I've never hit my kids and know plenty of others that don't as well and they're respectful, creative, amazing, fun, intelligent, kind, and caring individuals. You don't have to hit your children to earn their trust and respect. In fact, you're only earning fear. You don't need to create a mindless, submissive fearful zombie follower in order to have a ""happy"" family. Hitting a child at all, especially an infant is sick, disgusting, and hypocritical. How can you expect to use physical violence against someone and then tell them not to use physical violence against others?
Infants aren't selfish because they cry. Its their way of communicating! A Child should be taught to be an individual, to critically think, to learn right from wrong, not to just follow what they are told their entire lives. Do you know what happens when mindless followers do what they're told? Atrocities, wars, holocausts, genocide!
Teach and show your kid to love, to be kind, to treat one another with respect, to think critically, to do what is right especially if it means defying those who tell you otherwise, to have a mind of their own, etc. Be the change you want to see in the world. Some of the best and greatest people in this world have been people who went against the grain of society because they did what was right instead of doing what they were told. Keep that in mind!"
To Train Up a Child,Mitch Graves,"August 16, 2011",5.0,"The problem with this review star system is that we don't get to see the children of those who give it a terrible rating. BUT if you read through them you will see some subtle admissions such as ""I admit my children are not the best behaved"" Um...Say what? Why not? Mine are invariable the best behaved in pretty much every situation. Mine were so well behaved that my very big name attorney brother and my family court judge sister BOTH asked us for parenting advice. So I'll be the 1st to SHOW the kind of kids you get when you do it right . What you don't see is they are all ""straight A"" or nearly ""straight A"" students (not that this is more important than character by a long shot). They all get along so well that we have been approached by total strangers more times than we can count asking how we did it. We average a call a day from the two at the OTC. My 18 yr old son who started college at 15 still spontaneously hugs me w/o any reason. How many fathers can say that? They all share everything with us. They are exceedingly happy motivated kids with extraordinarily high levels of emotional intelligence. We have had total strangers come into our home to purchase computer parts and ask if they could just stay a while...I asked why and one man said, ""I have never been in a home that I felt this much peace and joy"". I could, and have been asked to write a book, but this is just a taste. I am CERTAIN that many of you could share stories and incidents as well.
The naysayers here are people who have silly leftist agendas and have NOT TRIED IT THE RIGHT WAY.
I'd bet my last dime that the majority of them are also quite anti-Christian or ""liberal Christian"".
They have opinions- we have experiences. Some of them go around the web posting to every sight they can find. It is the summer of 2011 and the streets in England and many US cities are filled with then kind of kids their bright ideas have created. They are burning cars, looting stores, and demanding the gov't be their mother forever. If you love your children you will make certain they are never part of this group. Good GODly character is the only way."
To Train Up a Child,M.M. Strawberry Library & Reviews,"August 20, 2020",1.0,"Nope. NopenopenopenopenopeNOPENOPENOPENOPE.

As of this date, at least three children have died as a direct result of the batshittery that is promoted in this book. The fact that libraries still have this book, and Amazon (and other vendors) are still selling this book (yes, I just checked Amazon) is a big shame in itself.

This book is so fucked up that I can't even joke about it. The author fucking advocates WHIPPING infants that are only a few months old. Whipping is also encouraged for every transgression, big and small. Also, according to the author, if you don't whip your child, you're creating a Nazi.



You're also supposed to whop babies when they're not able to sleep. Or whip them for crying. But wouldn't whipping an infant cause them to cry, and if you're supposed to whip them when they cry...



The author's wife also abuses children she babysits, including hitting a toddler so hard that it caused the kid to wheeze. Also, you should also totally abuse a kid until they're totally broken (yes, the authors use that phrase) Kids should also be hit if they cry for their mother.



You should also whip kids until they stop crying/screaming, and hurting infants who bite their mother's nipples (during breastfeeding. Instead of just, y'know, pulling the infant away for a bit) as well as tripping toddlers so that they fall into deep water. If an infant bumps their head or a kid skins their knee, ignore it.



The real shit-cherry on top of the shit-sundae though? If your child is being bullied, you're supposed to REJOICE. Also, it's ok to withhold food from a child.



Yet, Amazon and other retailers and libraries still have this book and make it AVAILABLE. (Again, at least three children have died from this. Others have been taken into custody by CPS, and adults involved in treating children this way have been arrested or faced charges)

The Pearls suggest using your size to beat and press a child into submission.



I'd love to see the Pearls themselves being beat by a gang of people bigger/stronger than they are until they're whimpering in submission.

This shit is fucking batshit insane and the Pearls are terrible, awful people who are far more in need of an ass-beating than any kid.

I've also noticed that all the 5-star reviews of this book I've read come from people who claim to be Christian and praise this book as ""sensible"" or ""common sense"" or other nonsense drivel that should NEVER be used to describe child abuse.

Funny how so many Christians seem to forget that Jesus preached kindness, not child abuse.

The Pearls also are okay with molested children remaining in the same home as their abusers. And before any supporter of these batshit nutters claim that I am making things up, here is a link directly from the Pearls' ministry website...



In it, the Pearls claim that if the husband shows repentance (too many abusers cry crocodile tears and continue abusing) then the children should be kept in the house with him, and that the wife should not divorce him. Even if the husband is sent to jail for his actions, the wife should still stand by him.

Because apparently, the abuser is more important than the abused."
To Train Up a Child,Brie,"October 29, 2015",2.0,"Edit: After doing some further research and reading supposed quotes from the book that multiple sites have noted, I do believe that the online version I wrote this review on was significantly edited. The version I read had no mention of starving (or withholding food as punishment), cold baths, putting children out in cold weather, wearing tubing around the neck as constant reminder of punishment, and several other things. This review is simply a pros and cons of the ""Pearl Method"" and also a comparison of what I read, to some of the claims other people have made, that I simply did not find in this version. -Brie


I decided to read this book out of pure curiosity. I read so many horrendous reviews that when I came across a free online reading, I tackled it right away, expecting to read a near horror story on raising children by beating them half to death.

While there are definitely ideas/practices on child rearing that are somewhat off-putting (that I simply can't go into great detail about), I also saw many positives. In all reality, many of the practices are actually very similar to how I was raise; and I can say with all confidence that I was far from abused.

That being said, I'd like to point out to all the critics that there is no perfect parent. There is no perfect parenting method and any and all parenting advice you receive, whether from a distant relative or supernanny, should be taken with a grain of salt, examined, and used with wisdom. Likewise, all children are uniquely created by God, which means one style of parenting may work wonders with one child while being useless with another.

Where do I begin?

Throughout most of this book, Michael Pearl’s tone comes off as very harsh and even condescending. Many people would be put off by this alone as well as the frequent comparisons of children and dogs. So I decided to ignore his ""tone"" and focus on what he was actually trying to saying. For example, comparing a child to a dog would offend many people's senses. But looking deeper, I see the point he has when he poses the question: if a dog can be trained to obey commands, how much more should a child, who is far more intelligent and superior than a dog, learn to obey? The basic premise of the message I received is that children are intelligent and should be treated as such. Stop treating them as if they can't learn, or they're just going through a phase, or ""it's what all kids do"". Your child is capable of much more.

I read a review that this book condones spanking with pipes. Maybe I missed it somewhere, but I never read anything about an actual pipe (I think a plastic tube was mentioned because it's not as hard as a belt). Either my online version was edited to remove the ""pipe"" or it was never there.

When it comes to the Pearls' ideas on spanking, I was very surprised that they believe in spanking as early as 6 months. This I completely disagree with. Aside from that, what I believe many people are missing with the entire concept of spanking is that you are never to do it out of anger. If you are angry/frustrated, they advise that you NOT spank at all! It is reiterated that you must stay calm, NEVER raise your voice in anger, and avoid even facial expressions that aren't in ""love and pleasure"". At the end of the book, he states that if you are unsure of these practices and/or know you have anger problems, DON'T DO IT. Seek continued advice. I believe many people glossed over the sections (or failed to read them altogether) on specifically how to spank. When ""smacking"" a child's hand, he describes it as a ""thump"" with his index finger, and that he has never ""thumped"" his children hard enough to make them cry. It is basically a ""surprise"" factor to get their attention. The entire concept of spanking is that of a child who puts their hand to a hot stove; when they feel the pain of the burn, they learn right away not to do that again. They also describe spanking as a ""surface"" sting, never hard enough to leave a bruise, which he describes as an injury. I'm pretty confident that the three cases that made headlines of children being beaten to death after using the ""Pearl Method"" must have missed that point.

What is confusing in this book is the ways they describe spanking (which I just noted about) and their language. It's hard to think of spanking as a ""surface sting"" when they use words such as ""rod"" and ""beat"". I believe this is what has caused so much stir in the community of parents. Perhaps a proper editor and writing teacher could have been of great value. It is too easy to misinterpret the Pearls' methods when language like that is being used. It's almost contradictory.

I do think the Pearls have some very unusual views on rebellion and ""driving it out"" of children and are extremely harsh in their tone towards the reader (which he admits), but also have some excellent advice that many parents SHOULD follow. Screaming, yelling, reacting to ANYTHING in anger is strongly spoken against and considered WRONG. Being consistent, explaining to a child WHY his is being spanked and showing love and attention after the fact, are all great pieces of advice.

Would I recommend this book to other parents? Well, not exactly. Why? Because it must be read with both eyes WIDE open and used with extreme wisdom. In the wrong hands, this could wreak havoc."
To Train Up a Child,Winston Jen,"June 13, 2013",1.0,"Here are just two examples of what should send compassionate human beings (especially parents) quivering in concern and fear. Let's not forget that the Pearls are not professionally accredited counselors or daycare operators.

Page 59: ""She then administers about ten slow, patient licks on his bare legs. He cries in pain. If he continues to show defiance by jerking around and defending himself, or by expressing anger, then she will wait a moment and again lecture him and again spank him. When it is obvious he is totally broken, she will hand him the rag and very calmly say, ""Johnny, clean up your mess."" He should very contritely wipe up the water.""

This will do little except teach children to use violence when dealing with inconveniences in their lives.

Page 80: ""On the bare legs or bottom, switch him eight or ten licks; then, while waiting for the pain to subside, speak calm words of rebuke. If the crying turns to a true, wounded, submissive whimper, you have conquered; he has submitted his will. If the crying is still defiant, protesting and other than a response to pain, spank him again.""

Anyone with a critical eye for fairness and impartiality will instantly notice the one-sided, ultra-authoritarian tone of the Old Testament's fifth commandment. ""Obey me or die brutally at the hands of your bronze-age, callous community.""

Small wonder, then, that a book like this was eventually published. Lydia Schatz, among other vibrant, rich, energetic and bushy-tailed children, were brutalised and murdered by their Christian parents, who cited this book as part of their inspiration. And yet, in the US, we have extreme right-wing conservatives blaming video games for school shootings (apparently, the right to own Weapons of Neighbourhood Destruction trumps the right of children to live in a safe environment).

If you think I'm being unfair to Christians by citing a single verse, there are plenty of others:

He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. -- Proverbs 13:24

Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. -- Proverbs 22:15

Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. -- Proverbs 23:13-14

He that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. -- Exodus 21:15

He that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death. -- Exodus 21:17

For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him. -- Leviticus 20:9

God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. -- Matthew 15:4

So much for treating women with decency:

Exodus 21:7-8 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

And what makes this even more pernicious (this book is bad enough) is the presence of apologists like Paul Copan who are willing to defend atrocities like this, and do so without an ounce of regret, remorse or concession to the opposing side. The Pearls aren't advocating love. They're advocating fascism in what should be loving families, and all too many gullible couples are swallowing their bile."
To Train Up a Child,Kelly H. (Maybedog),"August 25, 2014",,"I am not interested in reading this book because of the content. I have read many other reviews as well as a New York Times article about the book and its author.

Some quotes from the Times article:
The methods, seen as common sense by some grateful parents and as horrific by others, are modeled, Mr. Pearl is fond of saying, on “the same principles the Amish use to train their stubborn mules.
Because that makes so much sense.
Apparently the couple adopted two children, ages 7 & 11, from Ethiopia who they saw as ""rebellious."" (Of course they couldn't possibly have behavioral issues due to being moved overseas to a place where they didn't speak the language and placed with child abusers.)

The girl,
Apparently this was an extreme version of the author saying that
Yes, Heaven forbid a baby roll off a blanket. Where is said blanket? The top of the refrigerator?

Yet
According to both the Times article and other reviewers, the book instructs parents to begin corporal punishment around six months with implements such as the aforementioned and
One particular quote by Mr. Pearl really confuses me:
I would absolutely blame the book as having a hand in the owner's sobriety. I wouldn't blame the book for the alcoholism any more than I would blame Mr. Pearl's book for children acting out. If the author cannot understand basic logical comparisons, then I really don't understand how he can give advice on logical consequences. Oh, wait, they aren't using consequences, just violent ones.

The third death was also to an adopted child. This is really disturbing, of course, as clearly these parents have not been trained to deal with the particular difficulties that adopted children have. Pearl has an answer for that, too.
Of course. It's much better to leave older children in foster care than give them a permanent, loving home. Well, I guess if said home uses pipes to beat children and advocates letting them starve, then I suppose foster care is preferable. Foster parents aren't allowed to beat children or refuse to feed them. Who knew foster care was so luxurious?

My biggest question is, ?

To Train Up a Child,Keith,"November 9, 2014",1.0,"I wish I could give this book zero stars. It is a manual of how to abuse your child and to use religion as a cover story. I've read it. I've met the Pearls. I also knew the ""Pilgrims"" in Alaska and many other families that used this and similar methods with their children. Don't believe what you see on the surface. Below the surface there are many very dark secrets and much abuse. It is not godly, Christian, or anything else you may be seeking. It is abhorrent."
To Train Up a Child,Rosie Stephen,"November 19, 2013",1.0,as a parent the ideas in this book sicken me and i dont know how anyone can advocate it. Ive seen comments from parents who support this book having digs at parents who say my child isnt perfect and they think theirs are. To that i say bull no one is perfect and no one should be especially children. Children should be happy and healthy not scared or trained. Childhood is about learning by pushing boundaries and acting out sometimes. its our job as parents to show our kids how to deal with life not terrorize them. My kids are not perfect but then neither am i however my kids are polite and while they may clash with each other sometimes when needed they are supportive of each other. one child is 13 and unlike many teenagers in my area i have very little trouble with him he rarely talks back and does not hang around the streets like many kids these days my youngest child is 8 she designs her own clothes and shows a lot of compassion and caring she loves to give people presents even if it is something small and both are independent and have thoughts of their own that they feel free to share so while not perfect i am proud to be their mum. to follow the teachings of starving and beating your child is not only cruel it is also lazy and it does not make you a good parent it makes you a bad one you are teaching your child fear not respect and you are not giving them the tools they need to make it in this world this book should be removed from bookshelves
To Train Up a Child,Jennifer,"June 28, 2011",1.0,"I would have given this 0 stars if that was an option. I picked up this monstrosity of a book this morning and gave it a quick read over. This book has been mentioned to me by clients in the past, all of whom had given up the system and could not figure out why it didn't work when they used it faithfully. I will be the first to admit that my children are not the best behaved, but I would never abuse them in the manner advocated by this book. There is not good psychology behind the methods in this book. These methods result in fear and children sneaking around behind their parents' backs. There is no respect or dignity. The book advocates for physical discipline of very young infants. This should never happen and is never appropriate due to babies not being able to understand manipulative behavior. I am shocked that so many parents use this method. It is nearly as reprehensible as the Babywise book by the Ezzos."

Perpetuates every wrong thing that society does to oppress minorities. The protagonist does shit like helping and joining their friend in watching their sister have sex with another woman. That's deplorable. And then pretending to be trans to get into a girl's pants? This book is a hard pass.

He gets the girl in the end despite her specifically saying she's a lesbian and she doesn't like penises (which cissexism and transphobia much?). That doesn't happen in real life and it's a really unhealthy attitude to keep thinking lesbian women will just ""change their mind.""

Bottom line: if you don't know how to write about being part of the LGBT+ community in a respectable way, then don't write."
Adam,t x,"September 13, 2016",1.0,"if you heard that the writing was deplorable, insulting to your mom, lesbians, and trans folks to boot, you might want to know that it's also racist af. i picked this up out of curiosity for what the buzz was all about but eventually lost a bunch of respect for myself for doing so, as more and more racist comments unfolded throughout the story. it's kind of terrifying that it seems like i'm the first reviewer to point them out on here.

from pretty much featuring all white characters (in new york of all places) to comments about ""weird asian pussies,"" the cracker lez who wrote this book has got her racism on lock. from the get go, adam pictures a ""hot redhead"" as the (white) girl he'll fall in love with in (the white version of) new york. there's one chapter that opens up by describing what adam sees in queens as he first arrives in new york and it's literally full of racist shit about black people (""it was weird to adam that the whole civil rights movement had pretty much started over a fight to not have to sit in the back, and now the back was the only cool place to sit. especially for black kids."" p. 39). later on, he meets a black lesbian and the white author makes sure that a racist gesture is thrown in there (""'what do you, adam?' asked jackie. jackie was butch, too, and black. you're black, thought adam."" p. 187). we also even see the n word at one point. i'm sure our beloved author would just explain the advice imparted to her in her creative writing classes at columbia about ""just getting into her characters."" the thing with writing racist shit, bad white young adult fiction writers in denial, is that it's a bad move in every aspect and if at all attempted, should at least be in first person, rather than third, since that pretty much seals your place as our Racist Ass Narrator.

as a queer person who is kind of really interested in reading things that don't just feel like white people happily distributing white hegemony and flat out racism to my communities, i'd avoid this book at all costs. it's not worth the time you could have spent on another more unabashedly young adult fiction novel, trust me."
Adam,Emma,"October 14, 2014",1.0,"An awful, repulsive, transphobic, mess.

I didn't have high expectations going into this, I've had about enough of well-intentioned cis opinions on trans people, but I was willing to give Schrag the benefit of the doubt. And at first it seemed like it might actually not be that bad. Yes, the protagonist is a terrible person, but the implication was that he would grow. Yes, the trans people we see at the beginning of the novel were all one-dimensional, self-centered skater bros, but EVERY character was pretty terrible so it was just a minor annoyance.

But Adam does not grow. He is just as much of a transphobe at the end of the book as at the beginning, viewing the trans bodies at Camp Trans as disgusting, and thinking of cis people as inherently ""biological"". And the reader is stuck in his head for the ENTIRE BOOK. The use of Adam as an 'everyman' protagonist implies that Schrag believes that the natural thought process of the reader is that trans people are illegitimate and gross.

While every character is awful, the trans people are awful in stereotypically transphobic ways. The ONLY real trans woman character is an aggressive, domineering cheater. The trans men are depicted as being perpetually adolescent and self-obsessed.

Moving away from the trans milieu is seen as an act of maturity, for example Adam's sister's reaffirmation of herself as ""gay"" rather than ""queer"" at the end.

I am appalled that this book has been promoted as some great breakthrough in LGBT fiction, or YA fiction. Schrag is clearly writing from intimate personal experience of the queer community she depicts, yes, and there are moments of uncomfortable (and comic) recognition in the first half of the book. But ultimately it is not her identity that is at stake here, and not she that stands to lose from the, I would argue inevitable, misconceptions about trans lives that will follow from Adam's new exemplary status. A ""warts-and-all"" portrayal of any in-group is only courageous if the dominant portrayal of said group is improbably clear-skinned. For trans people, no such corpus of positive images exists--women tend to exist as walk-on punchlines, murder victims, predators, or at best vacuous agents of cis people's personal growth, while men don't exist at all. For a cis author to shrug and claim, as Schrag has in interviews, that she is simply telling an honest story is to ignore the profound political and cultural implications involved in producing a heavily-publicized ""authoritative"" portrayal of a vulnerable group to which one does not personally belong.

In other words, it's possible to debate how ""honest"" the depiction of the queer scene in Adam is. But this is not the moment--as transgender people are just beginning to crest the cultural horizon as actual people, not case studies or symbols--for such a disingenuous defense of (cis) artistic license.

Should anyone doubt that misconceptions about trans people are being left entirely intact by this book, incidentally, I would point them to the headlines of many of the reviews--""Boys Will Be Boys (And Sometimes Girls)"" in the Miami Herald, for example."
Adam,Ocean,"December 2, 2016",1.0,"Seriously, why is this woman considered to be a queer icon? That’s not a rhetorical question. Has anyone actually read any of her books? They’re full of hatred towards queer people, especially gender-non-conforming queer women. Like, if a straight person said the things that she says, their books would be protested, but she’s queer and she wrote some cute and insightful comic books when she was in high school nearly two decades ago, so we should just let her say this shit unchecked?
No.
In this book: butch queer women are repeatedly called ugly. Trans people are called ugly and freaky. A straight boy pretends to be trans because trans people are oh so much more privileged than cis people! There’s some racist shit thrown in there for good measure. And some sexual coercion, why the fuck not? Why not go all out?
I’m sure this book’s fans will be all, “OMG this is how people really talk, get over it.” But you know what? I’m not interested in that. Queer literature shouldn’t be a jagged mirror of straight society, reflecting back the hateful and frankly boring rhetoric that people spew at us. It should be a space that’s about our resilience, our strength, our beauty, our brilliantly unsafe lives. Of course, not all queer life is perfect. Queer people do shitty things and can be just as horrible as anyone else. But this just feels…mean-spirited? Unnecessary? Like it’s really not good writing?
This book doesn’t deserve to be labeled as queer literature. Ariel Schrag seems to be, for all intents and purposes, someone who wishes they were a completely obnoxious straight dude and is angry that they aren’t and is letting the entire world know it throughout their completely mediocre writing. That’s fine, but why’s it gotta be aimed at queer people? Why are you telling all the baby butches and tiny trans tots that they’re ugly when they’re just trying to find themselves reflected in a book? They’re not showing up in books as often as they’re showing up in real life. They need this space. In “Adam,” the space is essentially being desecrated.
The BEST part is that the characters all go to a L word viewing party…for a season where Schrag was a staff writer! JUST IN CASE it wasn’t obnoxious and self-referential enough. I’m surprised one of the (one-dimensional and unlikeable) lesbian characters doesn’t whip out her copy of “Definition” while we’re at it.
Librarians, booksellers—do the world a favor and take this book out of the queer section. Put it in general fiction, where it belongs. (In case you’re wondering why I’m ranting about this book that everyone else forgot about 2 years ago, it’s because it appeared on a list of Recommended Queer Reads at the San Francisco Public Library of all places. I thought, “aah, what the hell.” As my partner said recently, hate-reading is my second-favorite activity (right after snuggling).) Stop uncritically lauding queer authors just because they’re queer and pay attention to the bullshit they’re spewing. Question why there are brilliant authors (I’m thinking Gabby Rivera of “Juliet Takes A Breath” fame for starters) whose books don’t have half the distribution that this book does. I guess homophobia, transphobia and racism are just more marketable. More palatable. And that...leaves me feeling very hopeless."
Adam,Elle (ellexamines),"May 14, 2018",,no
Adam,Oriana,"May 20, 2018",2.0,"**Update. This review is getting a lot more attention now that they've announced a movie, so I just want to clarify: This is a bad book. It takes me awhile in my review to wind around to that, but it's crucial that everyone know this upfront. The whole plot is based on a fundamental, fucked-up deception, which is not just irresponsible but downright dangerous for a community (trans people) who have long been derided, abused, and even murdered for being deemed ""deceptive."" I cannot believe Ariel Schrag did this, and that it's continuing to be celebrated with a movie deal.**

The cover of this book includes the following endorsement by Alison Bechdel: ""The sexual revolution is finally over, and Ariel Schrag has won."" Flavorpill loved this too. Two brilliant GR-ers whose taste I totally trust both 5-starred it, one even saying that she's ""obsessed"" with it. So this was a slam-dunk in my head before it even arrived in the mail.

But you guys? I kind of hated it.

Let me start by saying this: I think that conceptually this book is important. It is in may ways groundbreaking and transgressive and necessary right now, seeing as how trans rights are the next frontier in the culture wars. And I am completely, obviously, 100% pro trans rights. As a cis & hetero lady, I do my best to be an ally, and to check my privilege, and to educate myself at every opportunity on gender and sexuality and all the proper theories.

So do not for one second think I am reacting negatively because this is a mainstream, basically YA novel that is filled with queer and trans characters, that portrays them as real people, that gives voice to their struggles and their thoughts and their reality. That is all fantastic.

So what's my problem? Well, two things.

First, I am not the audience for this book. The very reason this is so necessary is because the majority of folks in this backward-ass country do educate themselves on gender theory and do check their cis and hetero privilege, and so for the same reasons that we need racial diversity in movies, we need sexual diversity in literature. Duh, right? But I am neither a person being exposed to all this for the first time who needs to be educated about others' reality, nor a person who knows all of this inherently because it is their struggle but still really needs to see it all normalized in popular culture.

So the fact that this book is essentially Queer/Trans Theory 101 disguised as a novel just made me bored. Watching through the eyes of a seventeen-year-old as the gender continuum is explained made me bored. Being taught about the need for different gender pronouns made me bored. Being walked slowly through the difference between gender identity and sexual preference made me so. fucking. bored.

That part is my fault. The other part, though, is Ariel's fault.

Here's that: This is a book about a fundamental, massive, horrifying deception. I'm going to spoiler a little bit, but you already know this if you've read the book description, so here's what happens:
.

This is SO FUCKED UP.

It's fucked up on a level worthy of a person who has NO comprehension of gender theory and history, NO sympathy for the plight of a trans or even queer person. The only way, you assume, that an author who clearly DOES have the right comprehensions and sympathies can let her main character do this is if he is roundly and completely punished in the end, made to understand just how horrible of a thing that was to do.

But does this happen? Uh, spoiler: nope.

Oh it's true that Adam kind of learns his lesson, but not really, and he just gets off the hook like goddamn . And! What happens to his love interest in the rushed epilogue-y chapter after their affair is over is just .

Weirdly, as the book went on, the writing got stronger and tighter and better -- directly inversely proportional to the plot getting more and more and more appalling and problematic.

I don't get it, Ariel. What the fuck happened?"

Adam,Alex Maynard,"May 14, 2018",1.0,"As a gay trans man, this book is absolutely vile and sickening to read.

This book describes trans men attracted to women as 'lesbians', which is completely transphobic to say the least - they are not lesbians because they are not women, they are straight trans men. The book implies that a trans man is still a woman if he hasn't had gender reassignment surgery yet. The author clearly did no research on actual trans people, as I have never met a single straight trans man who identified as a lesbian, because we are NOT WOMEN.

The main character made me incredibly uncomfortable and disgusted me. He (a cis boy) pretends to be a trans man in order to get a lesbian to like him and become attracted to men - this is essentially CONVERSION THERAPY. His girlfriend in question even says she started fantasising about Adam being a 'real guy' which is horrendously transphobic as it implies that we are not real men, which simply isn't true. At one point Adam is even described as 'feeling trans in his own way'. This makes it seem like our identity is something that can be stolen and taken advantage of by cis people who shouldn't have it, when we are dealing with the real struggle every day.

At another point in the book, Adam and his girlfriend Gillian are getting it on, and Adam claims to be penetrating her with a strapon but is in fact using his actual penis. This is RAPE. This cannot be defined as anything but rape. He is lying to her and penetrating her without her consent. She did not consent to that. Anything that happens in the bedroom without both people's consent is RAPE, and this book treats it as if it is nothing.

In summary, I have never read a book that repulsed me more than 'Adam' and I would not recommend it to anyone else if it were the last book on earth. This is not 'groundbreaking', this is not 'hilarious', this is in no way 'revolutionary'. This is not representation. This is not what we need as a community. After publishing this monstrosity, Schrag does not deserve a place in our community any more. Do not give this book the attention it does not deserve. This is a book that
demonises trans men and women, glorifies rape and dishonesty within a relationship, dehumanises all members of the LGBTQ community and should never be read by a single person on this planet ever again. I am utterly appalled and disgusted by it."
Adam,Danny,"May 16, 2018",1.0,"Relentlessly transphobic, which I found personally offensive as a trans person. Gratuitous use of the ""r"" word for no reason at all-- many other, and less offensive, terms could have been used instead. Misrepresentation of trans men as misogynistic, hypersexual, assholes-- or them being represented as being only this way. Over-usage of ""ugly"" to describe butch/MOC women, emphasizing the expectation of all women to adhere to cisnormative, heteronormative standards of beauty. I found this especially disappointing coming from a queer woman writer. I don't care if this was supposed to be a reflection of an immature and unexperienced 17-year-old boy, still unnecessary.

The main plot line follows a 17-year-old boy pretending to be trans so that he can date a 22-year-old queer woman (because she's so beautiful and he's too scared to venture outside of his queer sister's social world and seek out straight women), lose his virginity, and be popular with his bros back home/ impress his best friend who is coming to visit him in New York. I find this to be a particularly dangerous rhetoric in a time when anti-transgender bathroom bills are backed by the idea that trans people are ""faking"" it in order to take advantage of women."
Adam,Christina (A Reader of Fictions),"July 14, 2014",,"Pages Read: 43

This book is making me really uncomfortable. I wanted to read this because of the LGBTQ+ stuff, but I've not even gotten to that aspect. Basically, I hate the MC. He's a horrible person and I don't want to spend any more time in his head. The only LGBT stuff that's happened is his lesbian sister telling him that a summer in NYC will make everyone at his school want to suck his dick. Oh yeah, and Adam and his friend watching his sister and her girlfriend have sex. The swearing and stuff in this book even makes ME uncomfortable and I'm a big fan of swearing. I feel like it's being intentionally crude just to shock, rather than being real.

I really wanted to love this, but it's so obviously not for me."
Adam,Gregory Baird,"February 9, 2017",1.0,"When I first picked up Adam, I confess I was simultaneously intrigued and repulsed by its premise. You see, Adam has the audacious idea to take the standard rom-com premise where someone pretends to be someone/something they're not, and throw in gender norms and sexuality as a twist. It all starts when 17 year-old Adam goes to visit his lesbian sister in New York City for the summer. He's determined to lose his virginity and make all his friends back home jealous, but finds himself surrounded by his sister's lesbian and trans friends. When he falls for a lesbian at a party, Adam pretends to be trans in order to date her. Done right, it has the potential to be a scurrilous take-down of society and what is considered normal. Done wrong, it's just plain offensive.

Well, Ariel Schrag has a lot to answer for. Because she did it wrong. Big time.

To start with, Adam has some hideously unlikable characters. You don't need likable characters to make a book succeed (just look at Lolita--a book that made its controversial premise pay off, I might add), but I feel like in order for this book to work you need to be on Adam's side. And you're not. He's a selfish, spoiled, self-involved brat. We're supposed to think that Adam grows up as the story progresses because he eschews his prior desperation for popularity, but that doesn't make what he does any less reprehensible.

I think Schrag was trying to make some astute points about how hard it is to figure out who you are in a world so caught up with labels, bless her heart, but the message got seriously diluted. Oh, and the story is set in 2006, but it doesn't seem that there's a reason for this beyond allowing characters to make constant (constant) references to the TV show The L Word, which--wouldn't you know?--Ariel Schrag wrote for.

I don't usually like to get into spoiler territory, but there's no way to discuss what's so awful about this book without going there. So if you don't want to know, turn away now.









Prior to this book, there was only one novel I ever threw across the room in frustration and anger: Angels & Demons, by Dan Brown. Now there are two.

Adam,shady boots,"July 22, 2019",,"Update: This is a Twitter thread from an extra that was hired for the movie adaptation of this book, and I honestly didn't think I could be more disgusted than I already was. Please read and spread it around; do not see this movie. Do not support it. https://twitter.com/cervine_salad/sta...

I know I haven't been on this site for a whole year, but I heard about this book on Twitter because it's apparently being made into a movie. The plot of this book disgusts me so deeply, I'm literally shaking with anger as I write this.

To trivialize trans identities into just...costumes you can put on in order to TRICK LESBIANS INTO BEING STRAIGHT? So not only is it ABHORRENTLY transphobic but it also thinks lesbians can just be converted with a snap of a finger, as if their sexuality is just a delusion they can shake away when they find ""the right guy"". What in the actual fuck possessed the author to write something like this? How the fuck did a TRANS MAN agree to direct the movie? HOW THE HELL DID THIS GET PUBLISHED?

Do not fucking read this book, and do not support the movie when it comes out. This trash doesn't even deserve to be associated with the LGBTQ community cause it makes a mockery out of all of us. And fuck the author for writing this, I can't even pretend to be nice about it. If you're reading this, fuck you."
Adam,Meghan,"January 17, 2015",1.0,"I don't know if I can get through this without just hate reading, since there are some issues of consent

Adam,Kara,"May 15, 2018",1.0,"So horribly offensive that I DNFed it on page 112. I'm lucky I made it that far. Trans folks and lesbians deserve better than this.

AND UPDATE. It's being made into a movie now? UGHHHHH. BOYCOTTTTTTTTTT."
Adam,Jessica,"May 13, 2014",5.0,"In a more normal world, I'd agree that a book where characters can't express the simplest thought without dropping six ""f-bombs"" and which includes a graphic (and hilarious) jaunt through a sex club is maybe a bit racy for the tykes. However, I'm not sure why, in this troubled world of ours where seven-year-olds are regularly exposed to Miley Cyrus, a book like this can't be marketed as YA.

Fortunately, despite meeting the criteria (except the PG test) for classic YA, is sophisticated, funny, and fascinating enough for all but the crustiest adult readers. Novels should be novel, and as such they fail if their readers sense they've been written before.

This book definitely hasn't been written before. It's totally novel and exciting and so much of its (our!) time, while maintaining the timeless elements of a classic coming-of-age story. is hilarious and brave, with its pitch-perfect fun-poking at a group of people who are often ignored, exoticized, derided, or treated with carefully policed phrasing and a stifling sensitivity. Schrag portrays her trans characters, young lesbians, hapless straight-boy hero, and other players as largely driven by their own insecurities and anxiety and desire to be accepted -- in other words, as human beings. Somehow pulls off a balancing of honest but not mean, comic while insightful, transgressive and fun while ultimately pretty darn sweet. The plot was engaging and I read the whole thing in basically one sitting because I felt pulled along and simply wanted to know what would happen -- would Adam get the girl? Where was this going? Could Schrag pull it off? How could this possibly end??

One thing I thought was cool was that I imagined this book would make sense to a young heterosexual man who hasn't really been exposed to queer culture or thinking about gender or LGBTWHATEVERGATRILLIONLETTERSAREBEINGPROMOTEDNOW issues, and I'm really curious if that's true. From what I understand Ariel Schrag must resemble a horny teenage boy herself, and I think successfully uses the currency of adolescent hormones and insecurity to explain important things that otherwise might elude that demographic, helping to elevate the wider population's grasp of sexuality and gender past the ""How do lesbians have sex?"" and ""Dude look like a lady"" stage.

In the end, I felt I'd seen a fascinating and astute snapshot of a certain time and place, and seen human beings caught, on the one hand, in the specifics of their situation, while behaving pretty much the way that we always do. That is, the characters seemed real to me, both in terms of the history and sociology being represented, and as acting like real-life young people. Finally, delivered a satisfying, complete story and a commentary on the complexity and fluidity of gender, sexuality, and growing up. Highly recommended!"
Adam,Ian,"January 9, 2015",1.0,"Look, all the deep and significant flaws with the representation in this book are reflected in other reviews. Yes-- they offended the heck out of me (me-- the 22 year old trans guy). Racism, antisemitism, transphobia, biphobia, etc etc were deeply ingrained in this book. Any one star review addresses those things. I have something I would like to add. The writing is just straight up bizarre. Besides reading like a queer theory 101 textbook with all kinds of stilted dialogue, there were some moments that left me scratching my head. Here are a few examples.



Why do you need to explain what american cheese is to a seventeen year old boy living in america? Who are you explaining american cheese to? Are you trying to establish that their privileged upbringing mostly sheltered them from american cheese?



What does this add to the story? He already finds out that it's his sister on the toilet by hearing her voice. Does his thought about women farting add some kind of element of characterization? I have to go with probably not.

There was another part where Adam's sister's roommate went on a date with a girl she met on an online dating site. This girl was: ugly, stupid, spoke exclusively in strange random non sequiturs, and picked her nose in public. Why is all of this necessary? The girl was in the book for maybe one chapter, played a very minor role in the drama of the apartment, and had absolutely no redeeming qualities or anything to make her seem like an actual real life human in any way at all. It's too much!!! It's heavy-handed!!! It comes off as ridiculous!!!

Also, there is no scale on earth by which I would be measured a prude but if this book is supposed to be YA, I have to say I would not recommend it for YA readers. Does sex exist? Yes. Should it be represented in YA? Absolutely. Should it be a constant barrage, assaulting the reader with vivid details of every form and function of sex imaginable? I don't think so. I mean, part of me has to admit that it's nice to see more than the standard insert tab a into slot b vanilla vaginal intercourse represented, but it was a lot. A lot a lot. So much."
Adam,Kats,"March 2, 2015",1.0,"In Adam our eponymous 17 year old hero from the San Francisco Bay area manages to persuade his mother to let him spend the summer before his final year at high school with his lesbian sister, Casey, in New York City. Apparently, their parents don't know that their daughter is lesbian nor what she gets up to in New York (she's a student at Columbia but she seems to be spending most of her time attending ""queer sex"" parties and other orgies).

If was written with a teenage readership in mind, I worry about what language has become acceptable in that generation, and more importantly what kind of behaviour. Sorry - I turned 40 last year, and I'm clearly embracing middle aged grumpiness with a passion; most likely I'm just out of touch. I'm no prude, and those who know me can vouch that I'm partial to a ""bit"" of swearing myself when opportunity arises, but the gratuitous coarse language in this book was worse than in where Christos Tsiolkas managed to drop more than 400 f-bombs in a 485 page book. My e-copy of didn't allow me a quick tally of those words, but it was horrid to read when all that foul language was supposed to be coming from the mouths and minds of 17-year-olds. Okay, I believe that some/many teenage boys have a notorious obsession with sex, but Adam's mindset was so sex focussed, it actually made him an incredibly dull person. Furthermore, I suspect that the author's objective was to shock older readers and entertain younger readers, but the dialogues were cringe-worthy to me, even without all the disgusting expressions these kids used.

The storyline was unlikely (how many transgender 22 year olds happen to be hanging out in the same place?!), the characters largely unsympathetic, the protagonist an egocentric dullard, the slew of sex scenes pretty revolting, the ""humour"" seriously unfunny, and the writing nothing special. Another off-putting thing were the many racist as well as sexist remarks, the mocking and prejudice directed at Jews by Adam's sister and flatmates (perhaps the author thought she could get away with it, sporting a Jewish name herself, but it was all very uncouth) and the fact that these kids seemed to live in a very, very white world, albeit in the middle of New York. I am amazed that this book was entered for the Tournament of Books 2015 - the only reason I finished reading it was to see if it would get better. It didn't.

For a much better read on teenage sex and transgender issues, I recommend by Lisa Williamson."

Adam,Emily,"April 23, 2014",5.0,"I am obsessed with this book. My friend Bennett describes it as ""the most LOL book"" he's ever read, and I concur. Its funniness comes from a profound and compassionate understanding of what it's like to be young and dealing with complex issues of identity -- sexual and gender identity and just becoming a person in general. I recommend it to anyone who's ever been been young and confused about who they had to be and how they had to act in order to be attractive, cool, and loved."
Adam,Thomas,"July 5, 2014",3.0,"Warning: this review will contain an inappropriate quote. Because Adam has a lot of inappropriate things. Like recreational drug use and explicit sexual detail involving pornography. All within the first 20 pages. You have been cautioned.

Seventeen-year-old Adam Freedman has nothing to do over the summer. He decides to stay with his older sister Casey in her apartment in New York City, and right away he finds himself thrust into the lesbian subculture of 2006 - night clubs, trans people, and attractive women abound. Soon he meets Gillian, the redheaded girl of his dreams, and they fall in love - only after Adam pretends to be a trans guy. Adam would rather die than lose his new love interest, so he maintains the facade, but as his relationship with Gillian gets more and more intense, so does the deceit that drains him of his freedom.

delves into the queer community and touches on often overlooked topics, especially trans culture. As a gay guy I like to think that I know a decent amount about lgbtq rights, but still taught me a thing or two. Most importantly, Ariel Schrag creates honest characters - lesbians, straight men, transgender folk - all with real faults and strengths, all with the real, human desire to be loved. Some of Schrag's scenes turned into educational lessons and lost their authenticity as a result, but those moments were minor blips in the grand scheme of the novel.

Adam grew on me as a narrator. His cynical and disenchanted view of the world captured me, and he progressed from a whiny, privileged brat to a sympathetic, likeable young man. At the beginning of the book he had no direction, but that changed the moment he met Gillian, and Schrag pulled off his development well. Here's one of Adam's many interesting thoughts that exemplify how Schrag uses Adam's narrative to reflect on subversive topics in the lgbtq community:



However, I had two major issues with this book. First, Schrag did not conclude Adam's ""pretending to be a trans guy"" story arc well. By the end of the book I almost forgave him because he gained empathy through his facade, but he still never faced the consequences of his transgression.
felt too convenient. On a more minor note, I did not appreciate
.

Overall, a good book, and I would recommend it to those interested in the plot synopsis. Some will love it, some will hate it, and I can see the reasoning behind both ends."

Adam,Michael Livingston,"March 24, 2015",1.0,"This is a big pile of no for me. The writing is breezy and witty and the idea of a YA-ish book that treats gender and sexuality in an open and interesting way is great, but the plot is basically offensive. The main character is unpleasant, the way he passes as a trans man to get laid is depressingly awful and the final twist, that the lesbian woman he deceives is basically fine with it and, in fact, is turned straight by the power of his dick is just gross.

More broadly, the book is clearly trying to provide some sort of education for straight clueless teenagers like the titular Adam about queer issues, but so much of the good work is undermined by the complete lack of comeuppance for him for his complete deception of his dream-girl (also: ugh to the idea that Gillian is the embodiment of some fantasy he had on his way to NYC)."
Adam,Liza Bertoli,"November 3, 2014",1.0,"Adam is about Adam Freedman, a teenager living Piedmont, California. He moves to New York City with his older, lesbian sister Casey. There he meets Gillian who he quickly falls for. There's only one problem Gillian is Lesbian. Adam is a stupid immature teenager and his solution, pretend he's transgender. I had a really hard time getting into this book. The book is written from Adam's point of view which is painful to have to read. He thinks about making out and porn all the time, not topics I enjoy reading about. He doesn't stay true to himself and pretends to be someone else to get the girl. I wanted to enjoy this book, but I thought the plot was ridiculous, and I couldn't sympathize with the main character because he's trying to be someone he isn't. He will do anything to make out with a girl. In the beginning he smokes pot to impress Kelsey and then pretends to be trans to get Gillian. It's hard to empathize with Adam when he clearly is a hormonal mess."
Adam,Em,"May 15, 2018",1.0,"Books about CORRECTIVE RAPE have no place in 2018 (MUCH LESS BE CELEBRATED). The contents of this book are absolutely disgusting and homophobic.

Adam,Sleepless Dreamer,"May 15, 2018",1.0,"If I could, I'd ask this book to give me stars. Can't recall the last book that annoyed me this much.

The characterization in this book isn't bad and it's a fairly easy read but I genuinely think this piece of writing shouldn't be read by anyone. I'm embarrassed that this book exists. The more I think about this book, the worse it gets.

During the book, Adam claims a trans person should tell the person that they're with that they're trans because ""a guy wants to know if the girl he's with has a dick"". This doesn't stop him from pretending to be trans to get a girl. It's pathetic and disgusting. The fact that Gillian differentiates that much between cis folks and trans folks is also problematic.

I don't know what the author thought but it's books like these that harm the community the most. They enshrine that it's okay to believe trans people decide to be trans, that the community is a joke, lesbians can be convinced to be straight, Casey's opinions are flimsy as if she's just desperate for the acceptance.

Adam never learns anything. That's what gets me. This could have had an arch where he starts transphobic but sees the light. Instead, he likes Ethan because Ethan fits with his definition of masculinity. That drives me insane.

I could spend more time discussing June's character, how all LGBTQ characters here are essentially a joke. I don't understand why would someone spend their time writing a book like this. Don't read it. Don't give it money.



- People who shouldn't write books write them.
- I love the gay-trans community and I think even in a disgusting book like this, our beauty shines through.
- I wish Adam was real so I could punch him. I can't believe an author thought this book is in any way appropriate."

Adam,Missy,"September 30, 2014",3.0,"I don't know why Ariel Schrag wrote this book. While reading it, I was wondering if it was to make our queer community look itself in the face for it's more-inclusive-than-thou tendencies and secret joy of labeling and discarding things as ""problematic"", or just to portray how horrible it is to be in your early 20s. The premise is ridiculous and feels as if it was born from that eternal problem of (squinting eyes) ""trans guy? or teenage boy..."" that folks who date trans guys always have.

It is obvious that Schrag is not writing this book to make friends. I just wish there were more books with trans lead characters that would have come out first before this book was written. It is nice to have some trans representation that shows some complexity, but I would love to hear it from a trans POV instead of a POV of someone pretending to be trans (which is not really a thing.) There were times of really disgusting misogyny that was a little jarring, since I've built myself a nice bubble home without it.

Adam,Melinda,"April 3, 2016",2.0,"Torn between giving it two or three stars, I have mixed feelings about this book. Upon reading its summary, I was appalled — a teenage boy pretends to be trans in order to get into girls' pants? — and would have never tortured myself to read it, had the main character not been from Piedmont. Even suffering through an offense premise is worth seeing how an author represents Piedmont High in fiction, I thought. On that front, the novel didn't offer much. Adam doesn't attend public school; he goes to a fancy, entirely fictional private school called East Bay Prep, although some existing Bay Area schools are mentioned, including Bishop O'Dowd. At first, I thought Adam to be from Berkeley, since all his and his sister's friends go to Berkeley High. That might be believable for someone living in Albany, but it's hard to understand for a Piedmonter. Of course, the author herself grew up in Berkeley, so I'm not surprised that she'd add that element in exchange for an accurate portrayal of Piedmont youth.

I generally avoid novels written or narrated by men, and was a good reminder of why. Adam watches pornography, masturbates obsessively, and literally cannot a girl without getting a hard-on. His best friend, Brad, is even worse. A borderline rapist, he dates girls for the sex, and then discards them when he's bored. He coaxes his girlfriend into cyber sex while Adam is reading the whole thing too, unawares to her. And the scene that I found one of the most painful to read: he drags Adam into the backyard so the two of them can watch, through the curtains, Adam's lesbian sister have sex with her girlfriend. Offensive doesn't even describe it. Male behavior in this novel straight-up horrifying, and I pitied every woman who had any interaction with these characters.

At the same time, the novel was addictive. I kept putting it down and then picking it up again, until I finished it in nearly one sitting. Plot-wise, Adam quickly leaves Piedmont and heads to New York to spend a summer at his sister's, where he finds himself immersed in the queer community. In exquisite detail, Ariel Schrag paints a vivid and realistic picture of queer/trans politics, circa 2006. From characters who read Donna Haraway (""She identifies as a cyborg"" p. 146) to zie and hir pronouns to intracommunity clashes over the radicalness of same-sex marriage (""He could tell Casey was quickly realizing there was something about being for gay marriage"" p. 116), this aspect of the novel feels very real, and it's thrilling to see this reality represented in fiction. The scene is portrayed with some distance, from a narrator who is neither gay, trans, or female and is decidedly unaware of what's going on, at least at the beginning of the novel.

Schrag obviously has had first-hand experience in the scene she describes, and it's a fantastic opportunity to offer some critique, which I was eager for. Occasionally, you get glimmers of criticism in some lines:

""'What do you mean 'gay marriage is not the solution'?"" said Hazel. 'It's the solution to gay people not being able to get married.'"" (p. 120)

""'You guys were dating,' said Adam. 'He sucks.'
""'It's just, it's kind of a trans thing, though,' she said. 'He's new to his body, his sexuality. As an emerging trans person, he needs to be free to explore sexual experiences now that he's not constricted by his assigned gender.'
""Casey was doing that thing where she repeats something someone else told her and it sounds totally weird coming out of her mouth.
""'I guess,' said Adam. He'd learned that anything that had anything to do with 'being trans' was not a thing you questioned."" (pp. 101–102)

""'You guys from L.A., the Bay, or what?' said Schuyler.
""'We're from San Francisco.'
""
""'We live in Piedmont,' said Adam.
""Casey glared at him. 'Nobody knows Piedmont. We're from the Bay Area — people know San Francisco.'
[...]
""'Isn't Piedmont kind of rich?' said Schuyler.
""'It's near Oakland,' said Casey.""
(p. 86)

(Despite the book's Berkeley-centricism elsewhere, that last excerpt offered a flawless portrayal of Piedmont youth and their rush to disavow themselves of visible privilege.)

So I hoped, really hoped, that Schrag would offer a scathing critique of both the disgusting, entitled male mindset and the toxic queer culture she portrayed. Unfortunately, this was rather lacking. Adam, who has never had any female friends, as far as I could tell, and only approaches women in order to get sexual satisfaction from them, imagines a beautiful red-haired girl who will fall in love with him and make him the envy of his male friends. Is his absurd fantasy and objectification of women challenged? No, to the contrary: It's validated, when he meet his fantasy redhead, who falls for him immediately. His friend, Brad, exploits women left and right and, let me repeat again, had the idea to . Does Adam end the friendship, outraged by his appalling behavior? Only when it turns out that Brad is, unsurprisingly, a raging transphobe as well as a misogynist. At the same time, the queer scene is full of disturbingly coercive sex. The whole cast of characters ends up at a ""play party,"" where women are being beaten, splayed out naked, and judged for their abilities to fellate dildos. One of the few characters who seemed to have any integrity, Casey's roommate June, jumps on Casey when the latter is drunk out of her mind, rips off her clothes in front of a crowd of people, and begins to ""hand-fuck"" her in front of everybody. The only person who seems at all taken aback by such incidents, offering mild criticism of the abusive characters involved in such scenes, is Adam. Who is in no place to talk about manipulation and rape culture.

Let's get back to the core of the story. Adam is not trans. He's not gay. A heterosexual virgin, embittered by girls' rejection of him, he realizes that when lesbian and bisexual women read him as a trans guy, he may have a way into their pants. And so he goes for it, quickly picking up aforementioned redhead fantasy girl, a character established to be a lesbian. There's not much reflection on the phenomenon of lesbians dating trans men (except for this brief exchange: ""[Adam, to his up-to-that-point-lesbian-identified sister] I thought you were ?"" [Casey] ""[...] I'm , or whatever""), but it is obvious from the text that these characters are only interested in female-bodied partners, despite their mantra ""Trans men are men."" And, taking advantage of that, Adam maintains the façade that he, too, has a vagina, only he doesn't want anyone to see or touch it, because of ""gender stuff."" Failing to tell Gillian the truth on their first date, he continues the charade into a sexually active and growingly serious relationship, spinning lies about testosterone doses and top surgery.

So, wow. Blatant disregard for lesbians' boundaries (Adam's love interest, Gillian, expresses multiple times how turned off she is by ""bio guys"") and shameless appropriation of trans men's lives.

But a shitty main character isn't necessarily a sympathetic portrayal. And the novel could have redeemed itself — had there been some serious reflection on how terrible Adam is. But, besides a lot of guilt pooling in the bottom of Adam's stomach, especially when he hears the news of a trans girl murdered by men who slept with her, he faces no consequences for his actions. His growth as a character is represented by clapping enthusiastically at Julia Serano's unnecessarily long reading of the spoken word piece ""Cocky"" at Camp Trans. I was not impressed.


What a mess.

There's also a strange current of (internalized and externalized) antisemitism in the novel, from comments about ""the Jews,"" as the Hasidic landlord and co. get called, and Gillian's fetishization of Adam's Jewishness. I'm not sure how to read that, since Schrag is Jewish, and I'm not, but I'll just throw that out there.

So what to say. I really don't know. On the back cover of the paperback, Alison Bechdel described the book as ""the most twisted, hilarious, and deeply gratifying reading experience [she has] had in a long time."" And, finding it hard to put down, I was consumed by the novel as well. But, ultimately, it failed spectacularly at what it could have delivered, instead reinforcing oppressive narratives and offering a slap in the face to lesbians and trans men."
Adam,Shelley Pearson,"November 3, 2014",1.0,"I'm not sure why I thought this book would NOT be totally effed up. The premise is creepy, a cisgendered straight boy pretending to be trans to get with a queer woman who isn't interested in dating cis guys. But I knew that Ariel Schrag is queer, and she's mentioned in ""Hot Topic"" by Le Tigre, so I was hopeful. I imagined sort of a Hard Love by Ellen Wittlinger vibe, but this book just drips with unchecked cis/straight/male privilege. I know, it's written by a queer woman, and it got a positive review by Alison Bechdel, but I did not like it. If I were to review this book with a t-shirt, it would be this one:



I'm going to call the whole rest of the review a spoiler."
Adam,Dana,"April 24, 2014",4.0,"Adam is a beautiful, coming of age, messed up love story. I loved Adam's inner monologue, it was so realistic. The gender language kind of went over my head, although I love how this book really made me think. At times it made me uncomfortable and confused but I think that is just another reason why it was so important that I read this book.

4/5. Adam is totally messed up and I love it.


Note: I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review."
Adam,Kevin Seccia,"May 13, 2014",5.0,"Adam is absolutely hilarious and funny isn't even what it does best. It's smart, sad, hopeful and filled with clever, true to life dialogue, but what it has the most of is heart. Heart as a description has been sort of abused and over referenced to where it doesn't mean anything anymore. When I say heart what I mean is the book has a spirit and guts and an earnest sense of life that you just don't see very often. In books or life. (I'd say pluck but that sounds twee? Right? I feel like I'd turn on someone who just used pluck like that was a normal thing.) This book has heart.

To be honest, I didn't know much about the world the book takes us into, and I was a little worried that would be a problem. I can be lazy sometimes about reading what I like and if you know you already like the setting or time period of a book you're part way there. But it didn't end up mattering, at all. The book is filled with such vivid, fully realized characters - who charmed me so completely - I'd have followed them into anything: Russian lit, romance, a western, an opera, something with powerful teen witches but one's a secret pirate captain, etc. it wouldn't have mattered.

The bottom line is I laughed hard, enjoyed every moment and at least twice felt like I'd been gut-punched by one of those dudes who can rip a phone book in half. I love this book. You can't ask for more than that."
Adam,Valerie,"December 6, 2013",5.0,"You know how when you used to read Judy Blume and you felt like you were always on verge of finally getting to the dirty stuff but then the scene would be over with some PG moment that barely lasted more than a few lines? Well, Ariel Schrag's novel finally pulls back the covers all the way and exposes what life and sex and growing up all really feel like in today's world and it's anything but PG."
Adam,Kitty,"January 21, 2020",1.0,"Possibly the worst book I’ve ever read. Maybe I’ll say more later, maybe not. I don’t understand why this was written. I am deeply disturbed."
Adam,Patrick Brown,"September 19, 2014",5.0,"This is a really fascinating book. It's also a really enjoyable book. Even the relatively negative reviews I've seen of it grant it that. The main character felt so real to me, so alive, so human, and also unique and distinct from anybody I'd seen on the page before. And the minor characters, the ones who are necessarily more flat, were still interesting and provided very true (in my opinion) points of view.

I'm wrapping the rest of this in a spoiler because the end of the book poses some very interesting questions and I wouldn't want anybody to read this book knowing what is coming. Read on at your own peril if you haven't finished the book."
Adam,Larry H,"June 16, 2014",4.0,"Sometimes when we're attracted to a person we bend the truth about ourselves a little bit to get them to like us. But no one does it quite like 17-year-old Adam Freedman.

As Adam's junior year of high school ends, he's not quite sure he fits in with friends anymore, because they all have girlfriends and he tends to be a little more on the awkward side. He desperately wants a girlfriend, however, and really wants to lose his virginity (although don't tell anyone he's a virgin). When his friends start pairing off in couples, leaving him the odd man out, Adam decides to spend the summer living with his sister Casey in New York City, where she is a student at Columbia and has fully immersed herself in the LGBT culture, without worrying that their parents will find out.

Adam finds himself drifting aimlessly through the summer, still feeling like a third wheel, and longing to meet the girl his dreams have envisioned—a beautiful redhead—so he can go back to his California high school a completely different person. When he meets Gillian—a redhead, no less—at a rally in support of same-sex marriage. He is instantly smitten, and when they meet again at a party, the two feel a strong connection. There's just one problem—Gillian is a lesbian, and has no desire to date a man. What's a guy to do?

Desperate to build a relationship with Gillian, he pretends to be transgender, one who was born female but has transitioned to male, which explains Adam's youthful appearance. (He's also led her to believe he's 22, the same age she is.) Adam knows that a lie, especially one so serious, isn't a good foundation on which to build a relationship, but he can't stand the thought of being without Gillian. The more intense their relationship grows, the more he feels pressure to tell the truth, but instead he learns everything there is to know about being transgender, so his cover doesn't get blown.

But Adam realizes how one lie leads to other lies, and the pressure of maintaining such a facade takes its toll on happiness. And he also learns that memorizing facts about what it's like to be transgender doesn't even scratch the surface of understanding what life is really like. Along the way he'll find himself in some compromising positions (both sexually and ethically), and he'll be more surprised than he ever imagined.

Ariel Schrag's debut novel is sweet, funny, and quirky. At times I found Adam's character a bit reprehensible, but then I remembered he was only 17, and many an immature 17-year-old has done far worse, particularly in the pursuit of sex and love. (Often more the former than the latter.) Adam pokes fun at every LGBT stereotype, and while it does raise some interesting social issues, ultimately it's simply a charming boy-meets-girl novel, albeit this one tweaks that formula a bit.

I enjoyed this book, quirks and all, and found Schrag's storytelling ability to be breezy and refreshing. I'll definitely be watching to see what comes next in her career."
Adam,Megan,"August 4, 2017",,"I finished this book a bit ago and am still kind of reeling from it. There were moments I really enjoyed, when I felt like the jokes were not *on* me but *for* me, but mostly I felt like there was not enough critical distance between Adam's pov and the worldview of the novel and as such the novel is just kinda stuck in my throat. I like the idea of this project as one of empathy for an alienated straight cis white dude wading through this new queer/trans world. but ultimately felt alienated myself reading it, and upset and defensive, wanting to protect the secondary characters (and myself and loved ones) from this worldview, particularly its transphobic and body-shaming content. The worldview changes as Adam changes and evolves, and that's cool to watch, I guess, but ultimately I wanted to see this character be humiliated and shat upon as a key part of that transformation. If anyone would like to collaborate on an alternate ending to this novel - let's talk!
//
Upon rereading and discussing with Liza in unofficial book club: Thinking of this now as a historical artifact of lesbian/trans tensions of a decade ago -- it does capture queer dyke culture in NYC a certain way; I'm still annoyed that the only positive rep of transmasculinity is the stealth trans guy who the cis guy most bonds with--and doesn't know is trans. All the other trans guys are misogynist bros or 'obvious girls' who aren't fooling anyone. Interestingly, the trans dyke character gets a lot of dignity that trans guys on the whole do not. For a book about cis appropriation of trans/queer identity, cis dude does not get punished--or even learn--enough in my view. In a way, he does transmasculinity better than the trans guys do (what! except for Ethan). But though the trans stuff is very on a level with Max's storyline in The L Word, there's a lot here to think about, and much to enjoy (great play party scene, for example; and Adam's sister Casey is one of my favorite queer characters ever). Interesting to think about this as toying with Shakespearean transition of gender deceit and the foibles that ensue, but definitely in this case, feels like exploitation of an ingroup to an outgroup and it's often uncertain who is the butt of the joke."
Holy Terror,Chip'sBookBinge,"December 5, 2011",1.0,"Holy Terror? Try Holy Sh*t, that was horrible!!! What the phuck was this garbage? This is what Frank Miller spent all his time writing, not writing, writing, not writing, changing the character from Batman to The Fixer? Mr. Miller just outdid himself here. He made me forget the abysmal Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again. I didn't think that was even a remote possibility. I stand corrected.

Now about this pile of dung. First off, the art is horrible. It's a lazy man's, bastardization of his Sin City style. Second, things that take place within the panels are so chaotic that you really can't tell if you're looking at a foot or a hand or a car or what. Third, the main characters are poorly thought out both in design and background story. Forth, the story itself was lame. There was no set up at all. Let me put it this way. Go rent True Lies and then fast-forward all the way to the final 20 minutes of the movie and there you have it. Reading this ""book"" was just one long fight scene and then it's over. There is no set up and there certainly is no resolution other than.....

Oh forget it. I've already wasted enough of my time here. This is a Skip for me and the rest of humanity. So, if this is so bad, then how did it get even a half star rating? I'm glad you asked. You know when you buy a new car and it comes with that ""new car smell?"" Well, this ""new book smell"" is AWESOME, which is the only good thing about this $30 book. I feel sorry for any saps that actually pay good money for this. I'm just fortunate to know saps that allowed me to borrow this book.

It's now safe to say that Frank Miller has written more sh*tty books than actual good ones. :::sigh::: Well, it sure seems that way lately. I need to revisit Sin City and read something good of his to get the taste of this one out.

Rating: 1/2 Star out of 5

Holy Terror,Ma'Belle,"March 4, 2021",1.0,"Holy shit, I had my suspicions that Frank Miller was a right-wing, racist, misogynist wingnut, but this book just confirmed it. I spent the first half of this just trying to figure out what the fuck was up and down and whether or not the stylized disorientation was an effective story-telling device. (Hint: my conclusion was a resounding ""NO."") The second half just made me ashamed that I was reading this trash in public. Holy Terror is a shiny turd serving only as a platform for Miller to scream at anyone opposed to the various military operations and wars in the Middle East. He is convinced that al Qaeda really is a looming terrorist threat that's growing in power under every freedom-loving American city.

Rather than buying this or even checking it out from the library (as I did), just read this much more interesting debate between Frank Miller and Alan Moore:

[begin quoted comment from with excerpts from recent interviews with Miller and Moore]: ""What bothered me more, lately, was finding out Frank Miller was a radical, militant, corporatist, Rightist saying stuff like this about the 99%,

""The 'Occupy' movement, whether displaying itself on Wall Street or in the streets of Oakland (which has, with unspeakable cowardice, embraced it) is anything but an exercise of our blessed First Amendment. 'Occupy' is nothing but a pack of louts, thieves, and rapists, an unruly mob, fed by Woodstock-era nostalgia and putrid false righteousness. These clowns can do nothing but harm America.

...This is no popular uprising. This is garbage. And goodness knows they’re spewing their garbage – both politically and physically – every which way they can find.

Wake up, pond scum. America is at war against a ruthless enemy.

Maybe, between bouts of self-pity and all the other tasty tidbits of narcissism you’ve been served up in your sheltered, comfy little worlds, you’ve heard terms like al-Qaeda and Islamicism.

...In the name of decency, go home to your parents, you losers. Go back to your mommas’ basements and play with your Lords Of Warcraft.""

What an asshole. And Alan Moore (who is also an ass hat in his own right, but who has more good ideas and values in general than Miller) called him out on it, saying:

""Frank Miller is someone whose work I’ve barely looked at for the past twenty years. I thought the Sin City stuff was unreconstructed misogyny, 300 appeared to be wildly ahistoric, homophobic and just completely misguided. I think that there has probably been a rather unpleasant sensibility apparent in Frank Miller’s work for quite a long time. Since I don’t have anything to do with the comics industry, I don’t have anything to do with the people in it. I heard about the latest outpourings regarding the Occupy movement. It’s about what I’d expect from him. It’s always seemed to me that the majority of the comics field, if you had to place them politically, you’d have to say centre-right. That would be as far towards the liberal end of the spectrum as they would go. I’ve never been in any way, I don’t even know if I’m centre-left. I’ve been outspoken about that since the beginning of my career. So yes I think it would be fair to say that me and Frank Miller have diametrically opposing views upon all sorts of things, but certainly upon the Occupy movement.

As far as I can see, the Occupy movement is just ordinary people reclaiming rights which should always have been theirs. I can’t think of any reason why as a population we should be expected to stand by and see a gross reduction in the living standards of ourselves and our kids, possibly for generations, when the people who have got us into this have been rewarded for it; they’ve certainly not been punished in any way because they’re too big to fail. I think that the Occupy movement is, in one sense, the public saying that they should be the ones to decide who’s too big to fail. It’s a completely justified howl of moral outrage and it seems to be handled in a very intelligent, non-violent way, which is probably another reason why Frank Miller would be less than pleased with it. I’m sure if it had been a bunch of young, sociopathic vigilantes with Batman make-up on their faces, he’d be more in favour of it. We would definitely have to agree to differ on that one."""
Holy Terror,Drew Canole,"October 15, 2022",1.0,"I re-read this tonight just to see if it was as terrible as I remember. I didn't even finish it the first time I read this book before I promptly gave it a one-star. Having read more of Miller's work in the interim, I think I understand Miller's stance more thoroughly.

This comic is pretty much a Sin City story substituting the protagonist for Batman* and the enemy for the Al-Qaeda. And, like how Sin City is over-the-top and stereotypical, this comic is as well. I didn't like it because the stereotypes in this case were not against mafia-esque gangs but entire groups of people (people living in the middle-east).

Batman says to a captured enemy: ""So Mohammed, pardon me for guessing your name, but you've got to admit the odds are pretty good it's Mohammed"" - I don't know if that's Miller being racist or making fun of Americans as captured in the persona of Batman.

I wonder if this book would be higher rated if Miller took out Al-Qaeda and substituted a made-up group, as is common to super-hero literature ('Hydra').

In his previous works, Miller seems very critical of a hands-on government. Even in his latest blog post condemning the Wall-street protests, the reader can deduce that Miller is against any kind of government intervention.

I would like to read this book not as Miller wanting to attack the Al-Qaeda, but rather as his fears of how the government can take control of its populace during a period of 'terror'. (ie, the USA PATRIOT Act** post-9-11.)


*The character is called The Fixer, but this story is obviously a revision of a Batman story

**Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001"
Holy Terror,Greg,"October 20, 2011",2.0,"Gosh, Batman Fixer! People really don't like this comic book...

I can't think of another book I've seen on Goodreads with this many one star reviews. People hate this. I didn't hate it, I didn't feel anything for it. I didn't know it was supposed to be Batman versus Al-Queda and that DC decided not to go with it, but I did think, wow these characters are an awful lot like Batman and Catwoman. But then I also thought they were also a bit like a really angry Daredevil and Elektra, which I guess is sort of the same thing. Either way though I kept thinking, cannibalize your own work much, you bitter asshole?

I didn't find the anti-Islam stuff very offensive, although I can see how some might. I did find the character who looked like that Rorschach from with a blue star of David on his face to be the stupidest looking character in any comic book I've ever seen (I guess he would be tied with that character who popped up in a comic back in the late 1980's (maybe this was Frank Miller's doing, too) who had an American Flag painted on his face, that character was pretty awful looking too). I found the ending of the book, well the climax part to be really stupid, especially the part where some jihadist starts blabbing about how he is part of something bigger, some vast conspiracy that Al-Queda is only a speck of. This reeked too much of unintelligible right-wing conspiracy lunacy, and was an unnecessary and unexplained 'plot-twist' that weakened an already frail story. The final kick to the head this book delivers is in the final pages where Police Commissioner Gordon (or whatever his name is changed to in this book) is unable to sleep, has nightmares and sweats from the suicide bombings from the beginning of the book, and he thinks something like, ""This is why they call it terror."" Ugh! Melodramatic sentimentalism! Oh, and the artwork sucks.

I think I know why a lot of people gave it one star, and I think everything I've said would make you wonder why I gave it two stars. Maybe because I'm not a comic book geek, I have very strong feelings for Frank Miller, but they are safely enclosed in the past, they are part of my childhood and I expect nothing of him anymore. If I had been expecting something from him I would have been very disappointed by this, but I have erected some kind of wall around my love for him for creating the story arc that was my very first and greatest comic book love as a kid and him as a person who does anything else (except for some of his , pre-minimalism stuff, but I read most of that when I was older and it has no emotional attachment to me). Miller excelled when he gave emotional depth and darkness to comic book characters, here he has gone from the extreme of giving depth to just reveling in the brute force of characters. It's like he's just gone to the flip-side of the comic book conventions that he helped to destroy.

I don't know what I save my one-star ratings for. Maybe those books have to really offend or hurt me. This is just very unspectacular and badly drawn angry man revenge fantasy, yeah it's against people who I have no love at all for, but this is just the comic book equivalent of watching an awful Chuck Norris type of movie from the 80's."
Holy Terror,Patrick,"April 8, 2020",1.0,"Yikes.

But I say that in a morbidly satisfied kinda way. I knew I was in for a train wreck when I picked this one up. I wanted to bear witness to the horror. And in that regard, this book didn't disappoint.

Rather than assigning this book merit points based on any ""so-terrible-it's-hilarious"" value it might offer the reader, I'd better just rate this a 1. That is precisely why I read this book in the first place. So much revulsion and critical condemnation is bound to attract curious readers. I was curious, and it turns out this book is as horrible as the reviews claimed it would be.

Was I offended? Not personally, but the rampant racism was staggering. Frank Miller is pouring all his hatred into this one. Even the art looks angry. I've never battled so hard to identify a drawing. Was I amused by how awful this was? Oh, very much so. Hence the feeling of morbid satisfaction.

So here I am, passing on my 1-star review with the hope that people searching for universally reviled and hilariously bad graphic novels will experience"
Holy Terror,Sam Quixote,"October 6, 2011",1.0,"This book was originally a Batman story and it’s easy to see how as the book opens with “Cat Burglar” being chased by “the Fixer” across rooftops a la just about every Catwoman/Batman story there’s been, and it’s equally easy to see why DC turned Frank Miller down for the use of the “goddamn Batman”.

Explosions rock the city and buildings fall down – Cat Burglar and Fixer witness this and immediately chase up suspects, all of them al-Qaeda terrorists (there is some real world input throughout) via the Police Chief who looks remarkably like Jim Gordon, and bring them all to justice before they achieve their coup de grace at midnight – blowing up the entire city!

Frank Miller doesn’t really seem to have a message for this book except pointing out that Islam has some truly despicable practices such as burying women up to their necks in sand and throwing rocks at their heads and making women wear tent-like clothing covering every inch of their bodies and then, behind closed doors, having their husbands beat them senseless. Obviously this doesn’t apply to most Muslims but the practice of stoning is still used today and just by inserting them into the story with no further comment, Miller seems to be using those examples as justification for the way Fixer and Cat Burglar use torture to extract information from the terrorists.

It’s clear Miller sides with the way the US government has conducted the war on terror. He seems to be saying that the terrorists started it, they hit us so we hit back, and that the terrorists’ extremism makes them different from other humans in the way they should be treated. No time is taken to discuss why terrorists might feel this way towards the West, simply that their religion forces them to be this way – a quote at the start of the book reinforces this view: “Kill the infidel” – Mohammed. And the dedication at the back – to Theo Van Gogh, murdered in the street by being stabbed dozens of times by an Islamic extremist – makes clear Miller’s idea of Islam.

Judged from a political standpoint, I’d say it’s up to the reader. No doubt some would argue Miller has a point with his views that Islam is a religion stuck in the past (the subjugation of women is central to this argument), and others would say this is the work of an ultra-conservative nutjob. After all, the core of this book is nothing but pure vengeance against a group of people and that smacks of the worst legacy that the 20th century left us.

Judged solely as a comic book I’d say the book is a disappointment as the story is barely together, the characters mere shadows of their more famous inspirations, and the art is so shoddy as to be completely indecipherable in places. It’s a disappointment because this is a man who played a central part in comic books being taken seriously as literature, the man who reinvented Batman with “The Dark Knight Returns” and who created a visionary and unique series in “Sin City” as well as stunning albums like “300”. With “Holy Terror” the things that made Frank Miller the respected artist he is today are absent in this book and in their place is a one-sided seething rage against the terrorism and violence of the 21st century, almost propaganda in a way.

I would say fans of Frank Miller will read this but wind up disappointed while from the sheer bombast of the story, the book will no doubt garner attention from the press and become an event book of the year for infamous reasons, but ultimately am I recommending this book? No; if anyone other than Frank Miller wrote this I don’t think it’d even be published. But then that’s the only reason people will read this, because it’s written by one of the greats, albeit one on the downturn of his illustrious career. It’s a shame Miller didn’t try to make a more thoughtful book instead of the shallow, hate-filled tract it became."
Holy Terror,Dave Schaafsma,"February 12, 2015",1.0,"Holy Terror(ism), Batman! Biff! Bam! Pow to Islam! This is a Batman book Miller wrote that DC rejected, so Miller changed it and made it The Fixer, an enraged post 9/11 pro-American and anti-Islam attack that makes Miller seem racist and misogynist and shallow, a right wing nut job. This is one of a few that may permanently turn people against him, those that he might still have supporting him (I mean, the second Sin City is getting a lot of viewers, so he's not hurting for support from those able to distinguish between his art and his crap). Now, I just taught The Dark Knight Returns in the past two weeks, so I have a fresh comparison to what Miller is or was capable of. And while these works do not exactly welcome in feminist readers, for instance, and while others may now see even these as too dark and violent, they are to me ambitious and rich and insightful and morally complex works of art.

Speaking of art, the art in Holy Terror is sort of post-Sin City splash and scratch and smudge, and while it is not always clear what is going on, I liked some of the feel of the visuals, but it, like the plot, is pretty simplistic and thin and more diatribe than art, by which I mean it is politically and morally didactic and stereotypical instead of complex and enriching our notion of humans and the world. So much of art leans left and when we see caricatures of, for instance Bush, we are used to there being critiques of him most readers might agree with; here, Miller is angry at Clinton and Obama and all the pinkos that he thinks are naive peaceniks, which is fine, he is entitled to his views, but not (for me, at least) at the expense of the complexity of art. If I wanted a political poster, regardless of political direction, I would go to a political rally or convention. There you find white-(washed) vs black, a simplistic world view. But that's not why I read novels."
Holy Terror,Jeffrey,"October 1, 2011",1.0,"Credit to Miller for doing what he wants, at least? To some people, I guess, the world is completely black and white. Or black and white with occasional spot colors here and there, like on shoes, or peoples faces and stuff. I had a hard time following some of the plot until I realized 'Empire City' and 'The Fixer' were metaphors. For Gotham City and Batman. A very visceral, emotional reaction to 9/11 and terrorists, but unfortunately lacks any nuance or the ability to see how complex situations and motivations really are in the world."
Holy Terror,Gregory Gay,"November 13, 2011",1.0,"And 27 minutes later, I emerge, bleary-eyed and wondering what the hell I just read.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not part of the legion that automatically shits on anything that Frank Miller puts out these days. He has produced some of the most entertaining comics out there (Sin City, Batman: Year One). He's also produced some of the funniest comics out there (All Star Batman & Robin).

This, however.. This is just bad. It isn't even entertainingly bad. It is vile, poorly-written, poorly-drawn, and ill-conceived crap.

There isn't even a story to really comment on here. This graphic novel is a collection of poorly-connected scenes. There isn't any real sense of cohesion or plot - just a series of events that happen without any sort of justification or explanation. The dialogue is a series of stereotypical exchanged at best and outright racism at worst.

Oh, yeah - let's mention the racism (and anti-Islamic sentiments). I'm not a person that gets offended. Ever. Holy Terror came close, and I'm not even a Muslim. I couldn't believe some of the things I was reading. Wow.

I was searching for something good in this graphic novel, and the closest I can come is the artwork... for the first third of the novel. The opening scenes of the book are excellently drawn, stylish as hell, and make great use of blacks and whites. After the first third, it all goes to shit. The art just turns sloppy - frankly, it looks rushed and unfinished.

Also, at times and without explanation, the art shifts from Miller's distinctive style to badly-sketched political cartoon caricatures of real-world figures. For no reason.

This graphic novel exists solely as therapy for some deeply ingrained emotional problems within Frank Miller. That's the only reason I can see for this random, gruesome violence and deep-seated racism. Miller has some emotional issues to work out, and it's pretty obvious how cathartic Holy Terror was for him.

Avoid it. Just don't go near it. It's easy to see why DC decided to drop the book, and it is just a sad piece of sloppy shit from a writer who has put out some legitimately good pieces of graphic fiction."
Holy Terror,Ashleigh,"January 15, 2015",1.0,"I dont tend to buy in to controversy surrounding books and films and I like to make my own mind up regarding the matter in my own time. That being said I have to say that even if you put the blatant and utterly offensive content (and not in a good way because I am far from one of the PC brigade) you are still left with the most poorly written graphic novel I have ever read, in fact make that the worst book. There is little to no character building, a shoddy romance that as a reader I couldnt have given a hoot about, and a plot that comes across as a pathetic attempt to voice a dated and incorrect political opinion. Miller was originally supposed to be writing this as a batman novel which is why there is such a lack of character building but how he ever believed that they would publish this with the batman name on it is beyond me. I also have no idea why he didnt write in a starting section when the publisher refused to do it, thus allowing the reader to gain some idea of what the characters are about. Throughout America is clearly the big hero and the muslims are horrid barbaric scum. I dont understand the half hearted attempt at deepening the story by creating some crazy secret muslim society and found the jewish character david totally pointless but again proving that Frank Miller has some twisted and misguided views on our world situation. I wont go into politics because I honestly just think everything he stated in this novel is so wrong. I feel so disappointed in him for writing this and it feels like he has thrown his career down the toilet although Im sure some moronic half wits will enjoy the triumph of the west over the muslims theme. Dont waste your money or your time on this. Nothing good can come of it. If I could have given it less than one star I would have."
Holy Terror,Mza,"October 2, 2011",2.0,"Listen, this is shitty in exactly the way all the shitty parts of Frank Miller's non-shitty comix (e.g., Elektra: Assassin , Ronin , Batman: Year One ) are shitty -- retarded telegraphic speech, lack of attention to details of human behaviour, video game villains, and a heavy dose of nerd sex that will help impressionable boys dry girls' vaginas for years to come -- but I'm not here to shoot barrel fish. Miller's simpleminded politics and psychology aside, the book's a rip-off -- ultra-thin storytelling for 100 pages in which nearly every page is a minimalist splash page. You get some familiar dynamic silhouetted poses from and ; some drawings that are sketchy to the point of not knowing quite what you're looking at; limited, specific use of solid red and green (Catwoman's shoes and eyes, respectively); and a lot of textural flourishes such as dripped ink and what looks like streaks of watery white-out. None of these things are bad , and I'm actually a fan of Miller's post- minimalism as a ; but these drawings leave nothing to become attached to. Nothing funny or weird, no faces that suggest a whole history of feeling, not even a reliably ordinary everyman upon which a chaotic world may imprint its confusing messages. There's no real chaos, only page after page of bare-bones figure drawing backlit by explosions. If all of this was intended as anti-terrorist propaganda, it falls unathletically short: nobody wants to jump from roof to roof with these two aerobics instructors."
Holy Terror,Rick,"January 15, 2023",,"I'm not ever sure where to begin... this was a mess ... a steaming pile of it.

First off: Why didn't I read this when it came out? Well, I don't have a good answer for that. I've always enjoyed Frank Miller's work in the comics. His run on Daredevil is nothing short of visionary. The mini-series Frank Miller's Ronin was wonderful. I absolutely loved the The Life and Times of Martha Washington in the Twenty-First Century. I've even purchased several versions of the collections. And at least his initial stuff with was quite good. Things did start falling apart though, his follow-up series to the iconic , , was rather mediocre. And his newer stuff leaves a lot to be desired. Has he just fallen into the trap that many best-selling authors encounter? Has he become so full of himself that he thinks he can just put out anything and his adoring fans will lap it up like cream? Or is there something a bit darker going on? I've realized that most of the stuff of Miller's that I really like are collaborations. So perhaps that's the missing ingredient (although I don't think that alone is the sole problem). Actually I think Miller has given in to fear and joined the white-American-male-vigilante mind-set. The underlying message that he's playing around with here is hateful and xenophobic.

But that alone isn't the only problem. I suppose my second problem is the art which is ... well ... amateurish at best. There are panels that are nearly indecipherable and many of the figures are little better than stick figures. The whole thing looks sophomoric and lazy. And it's certainly uninspired. Or rather it is seemingly inspired by the author's fears and how he wants to salve those fears by perpetrating (and encouraging) violence against a stereotyped group of individuals that he feels embody the source of that fear.

OK, now I have to go back to the rampant xenophobia. Let me call this my second point. As a post-9/11 graphic novel this is probably the most blatantly xenophobic piece of propaganda I've ever read. The hate drips from every page and the fear trembles in every panel. Has Miller succumbed to so much fear in this life that he was that compelled to produce this story? This is basically a Donald tRump wet dream. I'd like to think he produced this as satire on these xenophobic tendencies, but his juxtaposition of the depiction of terrorists destroying the equivalent of the Statue of Liberty with images of Obama and Biden and the phrase is so rampantly offensive that I can't simply pass this off as satire or some kind of twisted dark humor. Because even if it is just satire, it can be far too easily mistakenly read as endorsing violence against an entire ethnicity or members of a particular religion (even though those who practice Islam are no more war-mongers than those who practice Christianity).

Third: and this is probably the most troubling for me - this book was published by Legendary Entertainment, a division of a company that has produced quite a number of films over the last dozen-plus years. While some have been quite good and financially successful, others have not. But there are also a string of films from this company that also promote this xenophobic mind-set. Not all the films from this company are such, but many are and several directors that I've become increasingly disgusted with are associated with the company. This really makes me wonder if there is some correlative presence or agenda at work, that Legendary (like the Weinstein Company) won't end up tainting everything it produces. Pretty scary for me that this graphic novel is such virulent propaganda that it inspires such a conspiracy in my mind. That's very troubling indeed.

So, I've decided to see if I can give this a no-star review. That would make it the first of such for me. I found this graphic novel to be particularly distasteful and personally offensive."
Holy Terror,Hayden,"November 2, 2011",3.0,"** Purchased and read this earlier tonight, before I had a chance to add it to my 'currently reading' shelf**

I'm of the opinion that there's no such thing as racist art. It always irks me, for instance, to hear people say Quentin Tarantino is a racist because his movies Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown have extensive uses of the N-word. If it works within the context of the story, then it shouldn't be applied to real life. So color me shocked when, about a third of the way into this, I sit it back in my lap and think to myself, ""Damn... This is some racist shit"". Honestly, a publishing company actually picking this comic up and releasing it for wide distribution is nothing short of a miracle.

This rather short outing from the legendary Frank Miller features 'The Fixer' and 'Cat Burglar' (which is sort of ironic, because these two characters reminded me of those generic bootleg Batman and Catwoman toys you'd find at the back of your local dollar store, that were made by those shady companies in the middle east), as they run through Empire City and blast away anyone who has dark skin, a turban, and doesn't speak English. There's not much character background or development on the two leads, they just show up, and start shooting. I would've liked for this to be much longer, maybe if he had made it the length of one of his Sin City yarns instead of about one hundred pages and shaped like a children's picture book, it could've been executed better as a whole.

In the end, this was far, far away from Miller's classic stuff, but I found the art to be absolutely beautiful, and it kept me entertained for about an hour and a half, which I guess in the end is all I can ask for. I'm a little mad that I spent $32 on it, but I think it's one of those I can read again and again when bored. I will say that if you feel you could be offended by copious amounts of Islamic/Muslim racism, then steer far clear of this one.

Holy Terror,Christian,"May 24, 2018",1.0,"I once naively thought that Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again was the worst comic that Frank Miller had written. I also declared it to be the worst comic I had ever read. That was only a couple weeks ago, and I had not yet read Holy Terror. This book makes think back fondly to The Dark Knight Strikes Again.

Holy Terror was announced some years ago as a Batman book that would portray Batman fighting Al Qaeda. After years of writing, Miller declared that it wasn't actually about Batman after all and that he had discovered he was writing another superhero all this time. Now I do agree that Miller's recent books are not about Batman, but this book is about Miller's version of Batman. And it was so clearly written to be Batman that it makes it fairly obvious that he lied about the change being his idea. is about a vigilante named The Fixer who is having an affair with the Cat Burglar and works with the one good cop in the city. The changes are so obvious that they somewhat remind me of superhero ripoff toys where they would rename Spider-Man Spader Man in order to avoid copyright infractions. Its also incredibly hard for me to believe that anybody could have spent years working on this horrendous book since it reads as though it was tossed together one weekend.

The art is so awful that I started to find it hard to believe that it was not intentionally bad. It looked sort of like a foul parody of the style Miller used in . The art was so bad that I often couldn't even tell what was going on. I remember one page in particular where it shows destruction and there is a large red object in the midst of it. I could not figure out whether the object was a car or a shoe or something else entirely.

The writing is equally bad. Its hard to sum up just how bad it is. If was a satire of the hardboiled detective genre, then this is a bad parody of satire.

This comic is not just racist. It is extremely racist. But it fails at being the propaganda piece that Miller claimed it would be. The Al Queda are so powerful that they feel like over the top James Bond villains. They are portrayed as being evil, stupid, and ugly, which while extremely racist, was not very effective in a story telling capacity. This is supposed to harken back to when Captain America was used as a propaganda piece who once punched Hitler on the cover of a comic. That was an awful idea, but it even failed at that by being an incomprehensible mess of drivel.

The only good thing I can think of saying about this book is that it is mercifully quite short. Frank Miller has gotten so bad at writing and drawing that I honestly wonder if it's somehow deliberate. He was always flawed but every flaw has been accentuated so much that one must wonder if the man has gone completely insane."
Holy Terror,Alger,"October 12, 2011",3.0,"I am torn. I liked this book on the grounds that it had allot of the same ambiance of his earlier ""Sin City"" stories and I am a big fan of that noir storytelling. Where the confliction enters in is the piece's EXTREME Islamophobic and anti-Arab sentiments. The scene in which they torture and maim a terrorist and taunt him with patronizing dialogue, such as generically calling him ""Mohammad"" really sat badly with me.
Analyzing the duality between my liking and disliking of the book is eerily telling. That scene above as well as others were very much like those in ""Sin City"" and I think that as fucked up as it is, I was ok with those similar scenes, such as Marv dismembering Kevin to a armless/legless gimp and leaving him to be eaten alive by ravenous dogs in ""The Hard Goodbye."" Those stories were surreal, whereas ""Holy Terror"" was strikingly real in the portrayal of the terrorist acts that the over the top portrayal and generalizations of the protagonists are very insensitive and unnerving. Also, ""Sin City"" deals with the sins and infamy of individuals or small groups and gangs, not entire religions. Yes, Miller says that villains are Al-Qaeda, but he also makes great generalizations such as ""all terrorists being named Mohammad."" This was supposed to be ""Holy Terror Batman"" when he first wrote it, but clearly this is the reason why he had to revoke the Batman personas from the story. Batman, Catwoman, and Commissioner Gordon are clearly in the story, but are now written under different names for another comic company.
I liked the realism he brought to the terrorist incidents and the environment in which the story takes place. These scenes were beautifully and accurately portrayed, I think. The actions and thoughts of the Batman-esque ""Fixer"" and his cronies I feel are where the story declines into repugnance."

Holy Terror,Matt,"December 15, 2011",1.0,"A complete f---ing mess. Miller referred to this as unabashed propaganda, but that certainly doesn't excuse this waste of paper. It would be one thing if this actually told a coherent story, but the writing and art are incomprehensible. For instance, Miller will often take breaks from the story to include caricatures of well known political figures for no discernible purpose, or, in one case, cut away to a panel of a woman being stoned to death. Bear in mind that this last thing has absolutely no bearing on the main story; it's simply there to paint Muslims as evil savages with no regard for human life. (That's right; not only is it a story poorly told, it's also a vile, ugly celebration of racism.) The panel immediately following says, ""Meanwhile, back in Empire City"" as if it's a PSA, and he's now returning to the regularly scheduled program already in progress.

I'm really not sure what happened to Frank Miller. While I've never enjoyed The Dark Knight Returns as much as others have, Batman: Year One is--as I've said before--just about one of the most perfect pieces of storytelling I've ever experienced. His historic run on Daredevil is also one of the greatest in comics history. I've heard rumors of alcoholism, but I've never seen or heard anything definitive. All I know is that a man who used to be considered one of the greatest talents in the medium is now a total hack.

As for Holy Terror, I don't know if there's much overlap between comics readers and Fox News viewers, but that's really the only audience for it. Thank goodness the library allowed me to go without spending a dime on this dreck, and thank goodness Frank Miller decided not to make this a Batman story."
Holy Terror,Derrick,"February 12, 2014",1.0,"Feb 12, 2014 -- I thought this book couldn't possibly be as bad as I had heard. But now that I have finally tackled it: It's easily the worst comic by a major creative name that I've ever read. Frank Miller doesn't bother me, usually. Heck, I liked All-Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder, Vol. 1.

But this book is ugly, sloppy, confusing, racist, paranoid, stupid, and lazy. Worst of all, it's boring. It took me about 15 minutes to read it - maybe - and I was saying, ""When will this finally end?"" the whole time.

Miller has done great things with Batman in the past, taking him to his gritty extremes both seriously and humorously. ""All Star Batman"" is crazy, but it's kind of amusing because the very idea of Batman is ludicrous. ""DKR"" Batman makes sense within the era and the character himself. But The Fixer reads like an insult. Maybe DC rejected his Batman-vs-AlQueda story, and Miller was angry. So he wrote this unfunny and offensive graphic novel in retaliation.

I hope that's the reason, because I would hate to think Frank Miller thinks this book is actually .

Note: I do like the widescreen hardcover format, reused from Miller's own 300. And that's just about all."
Holy Terror,Bracken,"January 5, 2012",1.0,"Frank Miller's new work is so bad that it's actually beginning to color my opinion of his previous work. While Batman: Year One is one of my favorite graphic novels, looking back with Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again and Holy Terror behind me I can definitely see the beginnings of Miller's downward spiral in works I enjoy, like Year One and 300. Holy Terror carries all the hallmarks of Miller's descent into abject mediocrity. The dialogue is laughably bad and the art is even worse. The first half of the book is barely readable because the art is obscured by what appear to be sand paper scratches (I guess it's supposed to be raining) and the second half of the book is barely readable because it looks like a storyboard sketchbook and not a finished product. I'd add spoilers to the review but the story is so horribly shallow it makes an evaporated gasoline puddle look deep."
Holy Terror,Astir,"September 23, 2014",1.0,"Holy Terror is a propaganda comic in which Frank Miller finally loses the grip on reality he's been threatening to completely dispense with for such a long time. Here, Islam is equated wholesale with Al-Qaeda in an us-or-them war of cultures. The plot is quite thin (terrorists explode nail bombs in New York, and a Batman figure tortures and kills those responsible) and all subtlety is jettisoned in reducing humans from characters to simply propaganda symbols - for example: a character has the star of David tattooed on his face and his name is David and he's an Israeli intelligence officer who is Not-Batman's ally against evil. I'm not sure what coherent message I'm meant to take away from a comic that cherry-picks an inflammatory quote from the Quran, entirely represents Islamic people as members of a barbaric, bloodthirsty Dark Age mentality, and then has a superhero representing the civilised US christian right retaliate with torture, cultural slurs, and killing, but I'm fairly sure what I left with isn't quite what Frank Miller intended."
Holy Terror,Henry Feniuk,"December 6, 2016",3.0,"I don't usually write reviews, but after reading the string of one-star reviews, I was motivated to interject with a different point of view. I thought the art in this book was, at times, incredible. The way action scenes come to life in what seems to me to be a completely unique drawing style is just one of the things I love about this graphic novel. My eye was racing across the pages, transfixed on the action. I'm sure this isn't Frank Miller's political treatise on how to treat immigrants from the Middle East. It's fiction and some people need to park their political views see this as the work of fantasy that it is."
Holy Terror,Alex Sarll,"January 16, 2012",,"Regardless of your feelings on Frank Miller's politics - and while he's ruinously wrong about the Occupy movement, I suspect I agree with more of them than most people - this reworking of his 'Batman versus al Qaeda' idea has a bigger problem. It's lazy. I don't mean how quick it is to read - though it is less a graphic novel than a picture book with extreme violence. I mean that, apart from the opening pages, the figures look rushed, even beyond the common Miller-by-numbers stuff, into the level of outright incompetence at times. A missed opportunity."
Holy Terror,Matt,"October 20, 2015",1.0,"If this was actually a parody of Frank Miller's later work and his political and cultural xenophobia, it might actually be kind of clever. As an actual work from a formerly great comics creator, it's disturbing, depressing, and shitty."
Holy Terror,Eddie B.,"July 1, 2017",1.0,"This could easily be the worst graphic novel created by a comic legend.
Oh, and..
FM you MF!"
Holy Terror,Clay Fernald,"October 5, 2011",2.0,"Frank Miller’s most recent, and somewhat anticipated Holy Terror surprised me with its form factor immediately. Landscape comics are decidedly uncommon, but a clever way to have books stick out on the shelf. Miller has been working on this conceptually since 9/11. Partly a tribute to the Cap punching Hitler days, this work pits a superhero against a real world terrorist threat. Unfortunately, the master cartoonist, storyteller, and artist has missed the target.

Storytelling was awkward, abstractions were obtuse, and politically the story was tough to swallow. Also, make no mistake, this is a Batman story. Co-starring Catwoman. And Jim Gordon. Originally slated for a pre-relaunch “Dark Knight Returns” continuity DC Comics release entitled “Holy Terror, Batman”, we miss out on all of the good stuff in this release from Legendary Comics.

A WORD ABOUT LEGENDARY COMICS

Legendary Comics is a subsidiary of Legendary Pictures. The studio dropping such great comic book movies from directors Nolan, Snyder, & Singer drops Holy Terror as its inaugural title. Safe bet there, with Miller being a true master of the genre. We look forward to books from other Batman creators Paul Pope (Batman Year 100), Matt Wagner and Simon Bisley. Editor-in-Chief Bob Schreck was installed in late 2010. The personable Schreck is perfect for the job with over 30 years in comics. As a writer and editor he’s worked at Dark Horse, Oni Press, DC, and most recently at IDW. Will Legendary be the new ‘boutique’ publisher for high-end graphic novels and creator owned work? That answer has yet to reveal itself, with only three titles announced.

HOLY TERROR

All the pretending and dancing around that this is not a Batman book is most certainly a copyright and intellectual property issue, and not the truth. DC Comics would never back this up. Seventy years of establishing this important Bat-brand, only to be sullied by an attention grabbing pro-American graphic novel would not be good business. I estimate The Fixer to be sitting comfortably in the timeline of Bruce after his retirement, and roughly five years before putting the cowl back on in Dark Night Returns.

THE ART

There’s minimal dialogue, and no lettering credit. It’s safe to assume Miller lettered the book himself. Cool lettering and sound effects, too. His voice and his penstrokes are definitive. I’d love to watch him ink a page of rain coming down on a character! Ever since Sin City I’ve been in awe of his black and white Sumi-e brush strokes, the balance of the page, his chunky flat spotted blacks, wide eyes, and dynamic action. Dave Stewart provides masterful, well-directed, minimalist coloring (with a palette of no more than three colors).

I’ll drool over Frank Miller’s art any time, but this was more late-period Sin City than it was of earlier works of personal favorite cross hatch inkgasm, Ronin.
AS A COMIC BOOK / GRAPHIC NOVEL

The biggest failure here is that the work is painfully aware of itself. This is a comic book. There are comic book tropes such as callbacks to other Miller comics, and a rather awesome play on the nine panel grid structure. Is this book for comic book fans or the general public? I had trouble figuring that out, and still have no answer.

The Fixer is murderously acting out a revenge fantasy that most Americans dreamed of post our nation’s greatest tragedy (and many still do). Is there much of an audience for that, even ten years on? Or have we all grown from those feelings, focused on our families, regretted our wars, and decided to live our lives? I have buyer’s remorse after reading this. I feel like this was a cash grab from both fans of Frank Miller and from über-Patriots who would read abour this book in USA Today and relive a hatred never to be forgotten.

The story was compelling, but not surprising. I had known the plot from the original title, and internet rumors. The location change to Al-Queda’s Subterranea parallel was interesting, but by that point I was just wanting the whole thing to be over. I kept struggling to imagine that this was a young independent creator, speaking volumes on our social troubles. But this book was not the product of that. I was reading the work of an elder statesman of comicdoms’ elite who had nothing to say that wasn’t hateful, short-sighted, and frankly a bit empty.

MAYBE I JUST DON’T GET IT

Is Miller’s intention of this book being “bound to offend just about everybody” justified? By that, am I to be offended and just walk away feeling offended and say he did his job? That would be irresponsible and dishonest. Since when are critics to listen to an artist’s intention? The public is to digest and make their own opinions on ‘the work’. My strong relationship with Ronin and Dark Knight Returns are based on my formative years as a comic book fan wanting to read more of Miller’s work, and emulate it. Now I’ve got sour grapes because he’s telling me how to react to it. No way dude. You put out Dark Knight and I heard about it in 1987 because it was an amazing story. Not because you said it was. I’m not detecting an homage to old comics or irony at all in Holy Terror. Why is that, Frank? Hey, I stuck with you through that Spirit movie…is this how you’re going to leave us?

I’ll remain a Frank Miller fan, and I’ll be cuious as to what he comes up with for a next move. I’d love to see an apology, an explaination, or for Miller to go back to making great films and comics. I stand by Sin City as being as close to perfect a translation of comic book page to film as you can get. Hate speech, hate actions, hate anything will keep me away for good. If we continue to get more of this, you can be sure I’ll stay far from it."

Fue perdiéndose por una pendiente de pensamiento fascistoide y de darse así mismo la razón en todo y agravado con un caso claro de automasaje de huevos permanente. Con la misma vagancia y autocomplacencia que se ha tirado 10 años para hacer este bodrio, se permite llamar perroflautas y recomendar que se metan al ejército, a los indignados americanos. Bueno es cosa suya lo que piense y como lo diga, siempre que luego cumpla y haga un cómic como dios manda, por mucho que uno no comulgue con la ideología que desprenda. Pero no es el caso.

Tocado como quedó con el tema del terrorismo islámico, propuso a DC hacer un comic de Batman en el que este se enfrentara a Al-Qaeda y matara a Bin Laden. En DC le dieron la pastillita de las 3 y le dijeron que ni de blas, como es lógico. Asi que el amigo Miller se ha creado su propio Batman, al que llama “The Fixer”, pero que es Batman sin ninguna intencion de ocultarlo, con una Catwoman con otro nombre, un Gotham a la que llama Empire City e incluso una especie de comisario Gordon.



Pero no es comic de Batman camuflado, no. Es una puta mierda. Páginas y páginas sin nada mas que saltos por los tejados de el tal Fixer y la Gata… persiguiéndose hasta que se lo montan en un tejado siendo interrumpidos por una serie de explosiones que sacuden Empire City, a cargo de terroristas suicidas islámicos. 40 paginas iniciales que te duran un minuto escaso. Relleno y mas relleno de viñetas sin sentido, saltos y tontada… empezamos mal.

De ahí hasta completar las 122 páginas, vamos cuesta abajo y sin frenos. Cual Santiago Matamoros, The Fixer va matando sin control, torturando, justificando la tortura e incluso el golpe de estado. Todo ello con un dibujo ramplon y cansino en el que intercala viñetas de todos esos rojos que le son tan molestos, desde Obama, a Hillary, pasando por Michael Moore y todos ellos entremezclados con Gadafi, Bin-Laden, Ayatolás y terroristas y brocha gorda por el estilo, pagina tras pagina. Solo él, y sus compinches judíos que son tan duros que incluso los han expulsado del mossad, a pesar de llevar la estrella de David tatuada en la cara, tienen la formula para solucionar el problema, que por supuesto pasa por hacer estallar mezquitas en Empire City.



En resumen, una gran mierda de brocha tan gorda y tan absurda que no da ni risa, ni vergüenza ajena, ni nada. Solo te queda pena por ver en lo que se ha convertido este pobre hombre que una vez fue un grande. Siempre nos quedará releer Born Again cada cierto tiempo, pero lo que es Frank Miller… a este lo hemos perdido del todo. Que gran tertuliano esta dejando pasar Intereconomía."

No wonder we call it terror.

Holy Terror is an Islamophobic comic that focuses on a ""superhero"" (if you can even call him that) named The Fixer and his partner, Natalie Stack/Cat Burglar as he battles Islamic terrorists after an attack on Empire City.

Originally, this book was supposed to be a Batman comic by DC Comics titled (to echo one of Robin's ""holy"" catchphrases from the late 1960s Batman tv show), revolving around the title character (instead of the Fixer) fighting terrorists such as the non-fictional Al-Qaeda from Islam (you all know what I mean) as a ""modern"" propaganda comic (in fact an unrelated comic, , focusing about Batman in DC Comics' Elseworlds imprint was released in 1991, 10 years before this book was made). But in 2006 however, it was no longer a Batman project according to who said that it was a ""partway"" that was not a story about the title character. Rumors suggested that DC Comics' former editor was laid off and worked for Legendary Comics, which indeed implies writer, Frank Miller took the proposed comic and make it not be a Batman comic, which led it happened as well to get the cat out of the bedroom.

First things first, the rectangular dimension of this book: at 9.5 in. wide and 12.25 in. long, this is too big to fit on some shelves compared to other rectangular dimensions smaller than said size, I have seen comics without standard sizing compared to normal proportions everywhere I go.

The cover is a mere generic ""punching-a-crook"" trope in which the comic's ""hero"" named the Fixer is punching a terrorist member so hard, the stream of his teeth is defying gravity and flying out of his mouth in a straight horizontal line. Also, at a glance to judge from the cover, the comic implies that it's in color, nope it's in black and white (with very little color in some places).

Additionally, the art style, while passable, appears to be the worst of Frank Miller's since sometimes the characters will look hideous and have a highly uncanny valley look on their faces. Also, it even tries to imitate the tone and lore of his anthology series (which he is best known for and is far superior to this), but fails to make more sense. Miller often relies on unrealistic physics such as defying gravity horizontally. His other artwork is also wasted with so many people's faces in one panel along with lots of blank white panels that feels like Miller barely even draw details and negative space over buildings that are never detailed .

There's no characterization that in which we barely know much about the Fixer and his true intentions. Throughout the comic, The Fixer and Natalie Stack do not remove their masks and we barely know nothing about them without any characterization. In fact, the characterization is uncharismatic which some of the characters Frank Miller has written them are uninterested, racist, and super lifeless.

The Fixer, the ""hero"" of the book (and considered to be not Batman without the bat-esque horns in his mask) may be just as bad as, if not worse than the terrorists he and his girlfriend Natalie Stack are fighting, as he tortures other terrorists by revealing their plans and kill them. Even his name doesn't match where he ""fixes"" things and his costume nothing more than red-orange spandex. Also, he even tortures terrorists to commit their sins of their terrorism. We barely have any explanation of his motivation and backstory, where the Fixer states that he never have a family while spending his whole life ""getting ready"" for tonight, and that's it, making his ""battle"" for the terrorists pointless and unresolved. His moral the Fixer delivers is broken and hypocritical to a bad degree since after he criticises terrorists for having ""zero"" regards for human life, the next page (as in, the page) he says , making him as and .

Natalie Stack/Cat Burger is just a generic ""hero"" (or villain, I suppose) sympathizer who doesn't even care when the Fixer kills people. Her costume looks too similar to Catwoman without the cat-esque ears from her mask, and it ripped off Black Canary's. She has cat-esque eyes.

Dan Donegal is a rip-off of GCPD commissioner Jim Gordon from the Batman comics, whose walking is complete nonsense along with his cigarette defying gravity horizontally. He barely gets any screen-time and doesn't even care if the Fixer and Natalie Stack are killing terrorists something that Jim Gordon must never do.

The Empire City police department are very pointless to the story There is an unnamed police woman, however, who is actually the only female character from Frank Miller's who is not a prostitute or talking about sex, which is good despite only appearing in one two-page splash panel.

Amina is a generic suicide bomber and foreign exchange student who has Jaye commit suicide with her and is rather pointless to the story.

David, with a blue Star of David tattooed on his face and his 2 female Asian assassins served no purpose to help the Fixer whatsoever.

The terrorists (the main antagonists in this book) don't seem to be good terrorists, since most of the terrorists are suicide bombers, which doesn't seem very good if they wanna kill people since their getting themselves killed, and what's worse, near the climax, they drive jets and blow up the Statue of Liberty Expy, thus implying they could've done that earlier and it ends up making the suicide bombers POINTLESS! Oh, and speaking of their leader, he is depicted to be a dwarfed elderly man with beads all over his clothes and eyes.

The talking heads from return, but unlike that book, there are no speech balloons, so it basically renders them useless to the story and filler.

It's an extremely racist story about terrorism and Islamism where the Fixer is on a mission to take down the terrorists by torturing and killing them without remorse, which is never going to be good on paper or an interesting concept. But, this comic itself takes it as a ""modern"" yet ""serious"" propaganda comic. Of course, it has no right to have the potential to be a ""modern"" propaganda comic, as it tries way too hard to be dark and edgy compared to the old propaganda comics and media. It is also Islamophobic, as it accuses all Moslems of being terrorists no matter their age and have no regard for human life according to the Fixer and his conspiracy theories. The tone tries way too dark and consistent, the pacing feels either rushed or laborious to go through, and the fight scenes are meaningless and subpar. Even the ending where the Fixer and Natalie Stack succeeded in killing terrorists accomplished nothing to be ""heroes"".

Overall, this has the worst message of terrorism you can imagine that should be unkind and untrusted to people. It even said that violence is compassion and peace. Hurting others was not only justifiable but even could have employed first when dealing with threats and the way of power. It even said that we should fear the realism of terrorists that would frighten the people outside of Iraq or Iran or Libya or Yemen or Palestine or whatever.

Also, terrible dialogue like, and, even worse, Well, I'll tell you what's with that: that GODDAMN nail was this, as it was the GODDAMN nail to the coffin of Frank Miller's declining career in mainstream comics. Upon release, this Holy Terror-ble comic nearly destroyed Frank Miller's reputation...until he literally improved somehow in 2015's . In 2017, Frank Miller responded to his graphic novel on his blog and was intended to be an ""unapologetic"" propaganda ever since he was too old to serve his old country and imagines that he was ""pulling the trigger"" to himself. The following year, Miller stated that he regretted making this book containing said propaganda. Although he intended it to be a tribute to 9/11, Miller admitted that he was blinded by hatred and patriotic fever to the point that the comic became an Islamophobic diatribe and felt that he can feel the anger rippling out and never wanted to wipe out his personal life in his biography and not capable of .

This is highly controversial of Frank Miller's racist Islamophobic depiction of Moslems and other terrorists or terrorisms, as he states, I also felt Miller's writing was simplifying matters to barely an absurd level of being a ""modern"" propaganda comic. It's even the controversial subject for treating the enemy (terrorists) in this book as some highly offensive terrorist organization and religious from Islam. This is described nothing more than a tedious attack on Islam, and outright not interesting towards conspiracy theorists. I can imagine either Batman would fight Al Qaeda (which was originally in the final version of the book) and other terrorists when it comes as some ""decadent indulgence"" with ""real terrorists"" in the real world.

Also, if you've been on Amazon lately and looked at the ratings for Holy Terror, it has more 5 star ratings than on Goodreads! Don't believe me? Well, then,

This graphic novel is not cool. I cannot believe Frank Miller with his good reputation for making amazing graphic novels and comic books like , , and would make anything as awful as . My advice: .

-5/5 STARS (I don't care if that's a real rating or not, it deserves it.)"
Holy Terror,Britton,"December 29, 2021",,"I'll just be frank with you all (no pun intended), this is by far one of the most abysmal comic books that I've ever read. From its tone deaf, one sided writing to its incoherent, baffling art style. This doesn't even feel like a Frank Miller book, it feels like a parody of a Frank Miller book...and a bad one at that. This comic manages to be even worse than some of the latter arcs of Sin City and All Star Batman and Robin, The Boy Wonder. Yeah, I know that Frank Miller has that he regrets penning this atrocity and I don't blame him. I'd be utterly mortified if I put out anything like this. I know Frank Miller can put out good stories, even if they can sometimes be a bit corny with how 'macho' they can be. But this...this is something else.

Frank Miller did say that this was meant to be propaganda so...points for self awareness? I guess?"
Holy Terror,Periklis,"May 13, 2021",2.0,"This was sad to read. The whole project feels like it's made out of outtakes from a Sin City story with bad Batman characters pastiches (Batman, Catwoman, Commissioner Gordon) inserted as characters. Apart from some truly glorious double-page spreads, the whole book is a plot-less love letter to intolerance..."
Holy Terror,Mike,"December 19, 2020",2.0,A little heavy handed. Just a little.
Holy Terror,C,"August 19, 2020",3.0,"The first time you see Catgirl (or whatever her name is, I forgot), the ink sweeps sideways, and the area surrounding her is given just enough coverage to establish that she's putting her hands on something that looks like a roof. The most innovative part is the monochrome juxtaposed against the red of her boots, which allows Miller to go full crazy with the inks while letting you keep track of the action. The rhythm pauses between blank spaces and heavy inks. It's like a storm roaring, then stopping, then roaring, then stopping.

I point this out because there are idiots in the other reviews going on about how the art is 'ugly' or 'bad' (a term that merely implies solipsistic judgment, rather than actual communication and engagement with the work, which should be the point of a criticism) while people are spending millions of dollars on works by painters like Francis Bacon, Georg Baselitz and Jean-Michel Basquiat, who can be pretty much criticized on those same terms. Ever heard of Expressionism? Do you think Miller's doing this because he cares about letting you see the action clearly? (He even gives a nod to Van Gogh at the end. Correction: I just rechecked it. He was talking about the film-maker Theo Van Gogh. But the point still stands though, that calling Miller's art ugly holds as much value as those guys calling Van Gogh's art ugly back then.)

Miller is the master of pure effect here. He knows exactly when to let you see what he wants, and you feel the momentum it every panel. This is one of the speediest comic books ever, with most pages pushing past as whole spreads, while there's only like one or two pages where he crams everything into a chunk of exposition, as if he's telling you - Fuck the info, look at the inks. Even if you don't know what's going on, the terse poetry of his noir-esque writing, or the general movement of the inks will you. Movement. Space. Movement. Space. So if it doesn't, either you're too caught up in the politics seething in your own head to appreciate the art for what it is, or you just have really bad visual parsing skills.

Question: Is Frank Miller, in this comic, a really despicable horrible bigoted human being?
Answer: Hell Yeah! You should have got that just from the cover which depicts a caped superhero beating the hell out of a hooded Al-Qaeda terrorist. The question is, after seeing that cover, and possibly reading the summaries and all that, why did you even touch this book if you're to sensitive to that kind of thing?

Question: Should that fact determine my enjoyment of the book?
Answer: Sure it can. But, in the end, you have to bear the consequences of that. I'm getting an art orgasm on every page, and I have the ability to do that for every work of art regardless of what are the politics behind it. If you want to get as much pleasure out of life and art as me, then put aside the dagger, and clean those doors of perception already.

But, writing a review that merely attacks the politics of the work exempt of all other qualities fails to take the work in question as a whole. It's as propagandistic as Miller himself.

Question: Will a person coming in contact with this work be radicalized into Anti-Islamism?
Answer: Why should I care? There are 8 billion people in the world. Some of them will be stupid enough to be radicalized, but those people will probably be stupid enough to be radicalized by things like Call of Duty, and there's no way you can even touch them. Others will be smart enough to not be radicalized, but dumb enough to think that something as silly as a flimsy 100-page comic book that's drawn in expressionist inks will somehow lead to widespread bigotry. Two stupid teenagers were triggered by frigging Slender Man, of all things, to stab another teenager. With that amount of possible stupidity in the world, and yet things are still running without all-hell breaking loose, I don't think that a single bad review of an obviously radically bigoted work, based on political grounds, will even change a single ounce of that.

Question: What is to be done?
Answer: Simple. NEVER JUDGE WITHOUT DISTINCTION. This applies to judging bigots as well. Picasso? Horrible person, great artist. Polanski? Criminal, but great filmmaker. Sylvia Plath? Nutcase, great poet. Dave Sim? Wacko, but made one of the most titanic comics out there. Riefenstahl? JESUS CHRIST, RIEFENSTAHL WAS A NAZI WHO ACTUALLY RELENTED, AND THE FUCKERS STILL BURNT HER PUBLICLY. THESE BASTARDS SCREWED OVER A GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHER AND DIRECTOR BECAUSE OF THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR POLITICAL HANG-UPS. It's like if Trump were to totally relent right now and say that he's going to give all his money to aid Bernie Sanders, and people started protesting Bernie to take that. Thus, potentially re-radicalizing him to continue with an even greater furor.

Judging a bigot over one statement, without taking into question the full scope of his life, is as faulty a mechanism as a bigot judging a minority without taking into question the full scope of his life. Both are born from bad statistics, and stupid paranoia. Your brain will start looking like Miller's inks, overblown and grandiose in its terror.

That last panel, showing the captain's face completely twisted into all terror, with that outstanding last line, is the mind of every single bigot and radical anti-bigot out there, who can't possibly perceive of a middle ground, and compromise (since life is born from compromise). That's Miller's face. That's the face of the paranoid who looks at Trump's name being scrawled on University grounds, and then makes a hissy fit because people who have their own wants and fears are voicing their own valid political opinion.

You do not cure paranoia by castigating a paranoid. But privilege or no privilege, all humans are granted with an initial worldview of self-importance and aristocracy. A paranoid is a king beckoned into a corner. He's Scarface at the end of Brian de Palma's film. And this world is a world of squabbling kings. The true king accepts, and he does not play.

But if you're going to play the stupid game, at least make it beautiful. I'd take Frank Miller any day over stupid and tame political mollycoddling. At least Frank never lets the art out of his sight, and he's honest. This work is brutal, hate-filled, absolute trash - and I love it."
Holy Terror,Corban Ford,"September 7, 2018",1.0,"Aside from an admittedly spectacularly illustrated opening pages, this book was a racist, hateful, embarrassing, paranoia driving graphic novel against basically all foreigners. The story was wafer thin, the characters massively underdeveloped. ""Holy Terror"" is basically a crack back knee jerk reaction to 9/11 that was released almost 15 years after the tragic incident and without any nuance to distinguish it from being a satirical piece of work to something truly offensive. This is very much a pro-American Anti-Islam assault through the eyes of a racist, almost completely far-right nutcase. When I read works like Batman the Dark Knight Returns, and then read stuff like this that came out 30 years later and realize it's from the SAME author, I shudder internally."
Holy Terror,Fantasy Svet,"October 5, 2015",3.0,"Frank Miller prostě nemůže udělat špatný komiks – s touto myšlenkou jsem do rukou bral autorovu českou novinku Teror ve jménu víry, kterou zaštítilo nakladatelství Comics centrum. Musím se hned na začátku přiznat, že jsem byl plný očekávání – vždyť se jedná o komiks, který provázejí bouřlivé reakce, rozporuplné názory a hesla jako kontroverzní, xenofobní, antimuslimský… Prostě věc, kterou by si měl přečíst každý, a každý by si na ni měl udělat svůj vlastní názor.

ve jménu víry neměla jednoduchý zrod. Frank Miller (ano, ten pán, co stojí za Sin city, legendární třístovkou či kultovním Batmanem) jednoho dne přinesl do nakladatelství DC scénář nového příběhu s oblíbeným netopýřím hrdinou v hlavní roli. Bohužel se nesetkal s pochopením, neboť scénář byl dle vedení hodně přes čáru. Miller se však nenechal odradit a knihu nakonec stejně napsal – jen Batmana zaměnil za vlastního hrdinu, kterého pojmenoval Správkař. A ačkoli má člověk v první polovině knihy pocit, že kouká na Batmana bez uší, ve druhé části tento dojem mizí, neboť ho Miller nechal urvat ze řetězu a hrdina dělá věci, z nichž by měl ochránce Gothamu noční můry.

Příběh komiksu je jednoduchý, až prostý, přesto v mnoha lidech vzbudí emoce. Začátek představuje oba hlavní hrdiny – Správkaře a kočičí zlodějku Natálii Stackovou při klasické naháněčce po střechách, kdy se člověk nemůže zbavit urputného pocitu z toho, že přece jen čte Batmana. Zlom nastává ve chvíli, kdy je laškování obou protagonistů přerušeno sérií výbuchů měnících Empire city (tak podobné Gothamu či Basin city) v hromadu trosek. Netrvá dlouho a hrdinové mají dostatek informací k tomu, aby podnikli odvetný úder, jenž v mnoha ohledech připomíná křížovou výpravu. Přesně dle hesla oko za oko, zub za zub. A tady je zřejmě kámen úrazu kontroverznosti celé knihy, protože nepřátele netvoří skvadra superpadouchů, ale mudžahedíni vyzbrojeni Koránem a nehynoucí láskou k Alláhovi. Samozřejmě třímají v dlaních i pádnější arzenál, ale ten spíše ještě rozdmýchá Správkařův spravedlivý hněv.

. Miller jakoby se oprostil od všech zbytečností a udělal kresbu, která je hotovou pastvou pro oči. Jednotlivá okna jsou tak skvěle provedená, že si je dokážu představit jako obrazy zdobící nejeden obývací pokoj. Někteří by mohli namítnout, že obdobný styl znají už z Batmana, že scény s deštěm jsou jako okopírované ze Sin city, ale nutno podotknout, že Miller šel u Teroru mnohem dál. Scény jsou propracovanější, v některých místech syrovější, ale co je hlavní – působivé. Dalo by se namítnout, že kolorování některých detailů jinak černobílého komiksu je nepovedené (ano, narážím na oranžové podrážky bot), ale když člověk knihu vnímá jako celek, nestačí žasnout. Je jasné, že právě grafická stránka je oním faktorem, který Teror staví do úplně jiného světla a který mu dodává potřebnou sílu. Několikrát jsem se při čtení přistihl, že několik dlouhých minut hledím na jediný obrázek bez textu a užívám si jeho dokonalost. Frank Miller prostě ví, jak udělat své dílo graficky přitažlivým.

Celkové zpracování je na vysoké úrovni, čemuž odpovídá jak překlad, tak i netypický formát knihy. Na první pohled je zřejmé, že nakladatelství Comics centrum si na této knize dalo opravdu záležet a že čtenářům nabízí jen to nejlepší. Potěšitelný je také krátký autorský medailonek, jenž se nachází v zadní části.

Teror ve jménu víry je kniha, kterou by si měl přečíst každý. Její první půlka je strhující eskapádou a grafickou pastvou pro oči. Druhá část je na tom, co se příběhu týče, poněkud hůře, ale osobně si nemyslím, že by to byla taková hrůza, jak se nám mnozí snažili prezentovat. Největším problémem tohoto díla je fakt, že Miller spoustu věcí říká naplno a místy se utápí v nacionalismu. Ale, přiznejme si, který z příběhů Kapitána Ameriky nehraje na stejnou notu. Chápu, že téma islámu je v dnešní době horkým bramborem, jenž si všichni přehazují, každý o něm mluví a člověk má pocit, že cokoli proti i pro muslimské je špatné. Ale řekněme si na rovinu, že spoustu věcí, o nichž jsem s ohledem k Teroru slyšel, jsem v samotném komiksu nenašel. , ale až tak moc žhavě, jak se snaží někteří prosazovat, bych to neviděl. Navíc bychom měli brát v potaz i 11. září a odkaz, který v Americe toto datum zanechalo. Každopádně je třeba říci, že i kdyby vás scénář neoslovil, pořád tady zůstává obrovská přidaná hodnota v podobě vymazlené kresby, ke které se já osobně budu rád vracet. Frank Miller prostě nemůže udělat špatný komiks…"
Holy Terror,Julian,"November 18, 2011",1.0,"I read this because a friend asked me to (and bought me a copy). Let me just say that if I could give it zero stars, I would. One star is too many. Plot summary: nasty muslims kill lots of obviously innocent Americans and so our hero and heroine go on an Islamophobic rampage because there's killing to be done. The end. This was originally intended as a Batman story, and one can see clear signs of that: the heroine is clearly Catwoman, and there's a clear reference to Commissioner Gordon. But, my, I can see why DC Comics refused to have anything to do with it. This book is vile and stands directly counter to everything Batman stands for.

I could only read the book a few pages at a time. It's not just that it made me angry, but the manic scrapings and scribblings in the art just make it too hard to read for any length of time. So let's start with the art. The art is so over-drawn I can hardly tell what's going on. However, when Miller calms down and stops drawing ugly people and sticks to cityscapes, the art can be breathtaking, like the moon growing from the top of a skyscraper, and the long views across the city at night. When he forgets to be 'edgy' and draws planes or buildings with simple blocks of colour and clear lines, Miller's art is really rather impressive. It's such a shame that he insists on messing it up with his dreadful action scenes, which are incoherent.



It could be argued that Miller is trying to imitate Jack Kirby's action scenes, but, as you can see from this example, Kirby's art is dynamic, it's chaotic, but everything is clear, precise, you can see every tiny detail. It has a raw immediacy. Miller's, on the other hand, is just a mess.



I thought a nice example of the problem with this art was the scene of the jet flying into the statue: the jet itself was menacing and powerful, but the face of the statue looked like crap. Why not draw a face with the same clean grandeur? Or does he correlate good art with 'them'? Who knows? Certainly the only person in the book who's remotely well drawn is the evil female suicide bomber; all the 'good' Americans look incredibly ugly.

Which leads nicely into the plot. In the scene of evil foreign muslim woman suicide-bomber seduces good American boy into taking her into the club so she can commit mass murder, the good American boy is such a perfect example of the Ugly American, who can't imagine that there might be cultural norms other than his, and who is utterly intolerant of them, that I found it hard to feel very sad at his immanent demise. And that's the problem with the story. According to Miller, it's bad to kill Americans because you hate their culture, and I wouldn't disagree. But then he goes on to tell us that torturing and then killing Muslims just because they're Muslims is perfectly acceptable. But what he seems to see as good about Americans is their worst feature, and what he sees as bad about Muslims is about as representative of Islam as the Ugly American is of the US.

The idea that mosques are all just centres of armed preparation for attack is laughable as is the idea that an individual suicide bomber would know of Al Qaida's wider plans. Not to mention that Miller doesn't seem to realise that 'The Cell' is not a reference to biology, but to the standard structure of revolutionary movements. I suppose that kind of knowledge is un-American. The truth of the matter is that, with the exception of the Jihadist Q'tubist Wahabist Salafist Sunni, that is a sect within a sect within a sect within a sect within a sect, a vanishingly small number of people, Islam is principally quietist, about living your life in peace and the way of God. Al Qaida represent Islam as accurately as Rick Perry represents Christianity.

And the most loathsome thing about this loathsome book is that Miller misuses the whole 'hero saves the girl' theme from standard fiction, so, albeit very briefly, one almost wants the hero to kill all the evil Muslims who are threatening the heroine. Or, to put it another way, he manages to find the little bit of monster within each of us and presses its buttons, so we're co-opted to agree with him. And because of that I feel truly unclean."
Holy Terror,Andrew,"September 29, 2011",2.0,"I needed to read this. I needed to see how Frank Miller would write a comic with Al Qaeda as the villains to see if he would treat the complex subject matter with his trademark subtlety, sensitivity, delicacy and tastefulness.

Also, when Frank Miller is good, he's really, really good. When he's not, he is balls-out, bat-shit, lunatic-crazy. The moment he announced he was writing a comic in which Batman fights Al Qaeda I knew this was going to be the latter. So, five years later I find out that NOT ONLY has he abandoned the project that sounds so obviously like a bad idea, but that he has carried forward with it despite having Batman removed as a character (because, again, it is so obviously a bad idea that SOMEBODY at DC eventually must have filled in Frank that there was no way they would let their most profitable property be attached to something so controversial, let alone one being handled by a writer notorious for going offensively over the top).

All that being said, this disappointing... but not for the obvious reasons one would expect to be disappointed in a Frank Miller comic book in which a gritty superhero kills muslim extremists. In fact, it was what you'd expect from the premise, and nothing more. It is racist, it is jingoistic, it is blunt and it is offensive... but not to any absurd degree. The visual style is at times grotesque and confused and frequently inscrutable. This is not new from Frank Miller and I often get the feeling that he has done so in the past intentionally to frustrate and defy the expectations set for his work. You liked ? Well just try and like ! There is almost nothing the two books have in common thematically, and everything glorious about the first one seems to have been intentionally messed with and distorted with the second one. Same with and . Frank Miller has time and time again found ways to pull extreme reactions from his audience-- whether it be from taking characters and the medium to whole new levels to the ecstatic adulations of fanboys everywhere, or by breaking them down, deconstructing and ultimately destroying the same characters and mediums' conventions to the howls and reproaches of the same fanboys. No matter what Frank Miller attempts with his work, he commits himself and the result is extreme. I guess that's what I was hoping for here... and I didn't get it. Maybe he did it to me on purpose... maybe I'm giving him too much credit as a subversive.

Conclusion:
I can't hate this book because it is so obvious, oafish and clumsy.
I can't love this book because it is uninspired and does nothing interesting or innovative or expectation-defying.
I can't enjoy this book because it is not absolutely ridiculous and absurd.

Has Frank really been working on this for 5 years?"
This Is Why I Hate You,Daeni,"October 7, 2015",1.0,"I honestly did not think that the second book could be worse than the first - and was wrong.
One would think that the author has read critiques and maybe considered those before squeezing out another loveless attempt at writing. But he didn't.

The main character is again just a self-loathing, hateful Mary Sue with a god complex and all the other characters are unimportant, not described and barely completely named.

I can't understand how fans can give this piece of crap a five-star-rating with all the technical errors, the badly made characters and the complete absence of a storyline. If the feelings of this character really mirror Greg's, I hope I'll never ever meet him. It's more than scary."

Ladies and gentlemen, 104 books later, I finally give you my first 1 star review.

Never thought the idea of a “1-Star book” was possible, as most texts offer some incite into the perspective of another living being.

But this one,
Oh lord
I had three panic attacks this week because of this book.
I had to read self-help books to not go off the deep end, because of this book.
Why? You may ask?

Well, here are some actual lines from this PUBLISHED book.

""We are a curse this planet"" (pg 2)

""Take an honest look our species."" (Pg 3)

""Every little move me make around other people can change someone's life."" (Pg 5)

""Some madman setting of a weapon in a stadium""
(Pg 12)

""This was incredibly painful consider my right foot was still on his neck"" (pg 20)

""It would be difficult for them decline beyond the intellectual rock bottom stars they were already in"" (pg 30)

all within the first 30 pages...
I made no typos; this is exactly how some sentences are written. And we are just a fifth through this garbage (it’s actually 150ish pages despite what goodreads says)

As for the plot
We have a kid complain about his father and school for 8 chapters
Then he complains about the air force for 9 more chapters
Then his girlfriend leaves him for a girl but he’s fine with that because he respects the LGBT (I don’t know either)
Then he kills three people and gets killed in the process
And his girlfriend says how’s he’s an amazing man.
The end.

If you’re wondering if this is a work of a 33 year old grown-up, who hasn’t grown up, and wants to complain about his immaturity by channeling into a book, then you are 100% correct.

This is a grown mans diary about how he hates the world and how the world should try to be more like him, even though he manipulates and completely ignores his first girlfriend, breaks his fathers nose, whines about the Air Force (which the author whines about in real life when he was temporarily enlisted), and kills people.

Yes, boys and girls, let’s be like him.

Or.

You can realize that the author is the definition of a toxic individual, and do what I was too stupid to do, and not engage in anything he’s a part of.

This Is Why I Hate You,Caroline Fosse,"November 25, 2018",1.0,"I’m not an Onision fan, and I never will be, especially not after this book. I’m disgusted, and I can see why this was self-published, any publishing house would be shamed for publishing something as bad and problematic as this. I wouldn’t even be surprised if this was an autobiography, because this is filled with negative comments about other people and things in general, just like a lot of his youtube videos. No matter if you like him or not, I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone, and here’s why;

The main character Arthur (or as we all probably like to call him, Greg) writes about his life and how every single person sucks and he’s the only intellectual who understands how the world really works, however, he broke a guys arm because he touched Arthurs girlfriends hips without her permission, beat up his dad for choking him (and of course, that was self defense, but he didn’t stop when his father let go of him. He actually attacked him, kicked him multiple times, got angry after his father bailed him out of jail, constantly talked negatively about his «stupid religion» etc), writes about how he likes to control his girlfriend, yelled at her and her friends because she didn’t want to leave them at lunch, and just acted horrible in general. The worst part is, personally I don’t believe this is a character he made up. I think he made this character based on his own life, acting out on the people in the story because thats what he wanted to do in the situations he was put in.

He constantly talked about how fat and ugly his fathers new girlfriend was, basically told her she was fat and gross in front of her dad, but couldn’t see why his father got mad and attacked him, yet he broke a guys arm for touching his girlfriends’ hips for two seconds. I just don’t understand the logic, this whole book was a mess.

In one of his videos he said this: «The fact that I served in the air force for just under four years, yeah I think I might know what I'm talking about». Weird, considering this book was filled with things the military wouldn’t tolerate or accept from the main character. If someone in the military acted the way the main character acted, they would be kicked out a long time ago. They wouldn’t just brush off the fact that one of their men broke one of his superiors ankle in a fight and wouldn’t stop punching that person until they dragged him away. They wouldn’t just ask if he was a psychopath and let him go like he didn’t do anything wrong.

Someone said they could edit the book for him, give him constructive criticism and correct his grammar, but it doesn’t seem like Greg handles any form of feedback (at all). It seems like he just lives in his own little bobble where everything he does is good enough, and everyone who gives him constructive criticism about anything what so ever gets shut down because «its not necessary», clearly he should’ve taking all the help he was offered, because it was terrible. He tells other people to go fuck themselves because they dislikes his book, and even though I get why he would be upset when someone hates what he’s been working on for a long time, people are allowed to have opinions. If you write a book and publish it, you’re not just gonna get positive reviews. There’s gonna be a lot of people disliking it,"
This Is Why I Hate You,Diana,"November 30, 2017",1.0,"If you read some of the reviews for this book and others you'll find stuff like ""This book has bad grammer, bad spelling, poor character development, lack of most things you'd find in a novel but I LOVE ONISION SO 5 STARS!"". That says a lot.

I couldn't get through the entire book, stopped about 3/4s of the way in. Tried my best to read it objectively and just... why? I don't even know where to begin. Bad everything. Why did he not have an editor? I don't think the author has picked up a single book in his life."

Alright, brief re-cap. Arthur is a high school emo boy who hates his dad. His mom died and he blames everything on his dad's new girlfriend. After assaulting his dad, popping his girlfriend's cherry and getting expelled for breaking a fellow student's arm, he leaves for the military.

There he meets another girl, tries to pop her cherry, fails and moves to Korea. There, he rolls around the haybale with another girl, but the second girl comes to Korea too. They have a menage a trois. Then, the second girl gets in trouble, the third girl also gets in trouble, he tries to save them but something happens. (I won't spoil this work of art).

Again, probably the best book I have ever read. I think that it is even better than Twilight. I think that Twilight was probably too interesting compared to this book. Everyone needs something bland and boring to waste an hour of their lives on.

Both of his books are riddled with grammar issues, but it did not affect the experience one bit. It just added to it. The mistakes do not make my brains hurt and make me lose brain cells. To prove to you and myself, I will write my take on the characters in what I perceive to be the style of this book. To you know, give you a taste.

NOTE: The following review is a hyperbolical result of losing a couple IQ points in order to understand this book. I will, however, leave out grammatical issues unless it is unintentional.

Arthur: He is the writer of the literal diary. Joins the military and is super strong. Loves push-ups and laughing at pussy jokes. Only if it's a man though. If a woman makes a joke I will correct them. Also, the human species should just die. I hate people who watch sports. I hate my dad. He is literally the worst. (Yes the perspective changes. Even in the book consistency is not key.) I hate vegetarians and I love leg-sweeping bullies. I must protect my girlfriends and property.

Girlfriend one: Arthur is hot. We had sex and then he joined the military and I am never mentioned again.

Girlfriend two: You literally don't know what I look like. I like girls. That is a problem.

Girlfriend three: I have a biiiig butt. Authur literally calls me booty. That's not degrading.

Dad: My son thinks I hate him because I try to discipline him. Also, I am vegetarian. You don't know my name.

Dad's girlfriend: You don't know my name or how I look like. Arthur calls me horrible names that are not demeaning at all.

This is a fun way to review. What a great book. 10/10 would read again."

This Is Why I Hate You,Britton,"April 20, 2021",,"Ahh...Onision, if ever a psychotic buffoon such as this could exist. His mere existence makes you question if there is justice in this world or if there is a benevolent god. His mere presence might even discredit the idea of justice and every organized religion that's been in history.

In all seriousness, I'm still baffled how this man still has a presence on the internet even after all of the heinous shit that he's done over the years. It's almost Trump levels of baffling of how such a megalomaniacal, narcissistic sociopath is still somehow on Youtube and still has a platform. It's almost like he wants to push things to the limit to see how far he can go before he loses everything that's dear to him.

As I've , there are authors out there who can write about repugnant, unpleasant characters. But I don't think that Onision is one of those authors, from what of his books that I've read, I find that they're more of an extension of his fucked up, twisted psyche than an artistic exploration of human depravity and insanity. From the bits that I did read and what I heard from the other reviewers, I wasn't very impressed with it and I was reminded of Axl Barnes' books in its mean spirited, self indulgent tone that I found throughout my readings through Onision's work. It speaks more to the man I often see, a narcissistic, creepy guy who is unable to grasp that he's the author of his own problems, and can't accept that he is the cause of his own misery.

I may despise Razorfist, but at least the guy has the intelligence to understand when people have actually taken him to task, and can admit that he's wrong. But if you've paid attention to anything that this man has ever done, then you'll quickly grow to understand that this is not possible with him. Everything that he's ever touched, he has turned to shit. Even when he tries to do what's 'right' in his demented, twisted view of the world, he is unbelievably incompetent, ignorant, and hypocritical.

So no, I won't be supporting this guy's work, or anything that he ever finds himself doing in the future. His works have earned a hard pass from me.

This Is Why I Hate You,Nathan Wikman,"August 7, 2019",1.0,"Tw: sexual assault


I was given this book by a friend and encouraged to read specifically because the book is a train wreck. Not only is the writing awful, the main character is an unredeemable sociopath. It's written as a journal entry, but the author directly addresses the audience throughout the book. The women in this book are like white walls that exist for the protagonist to bounce his own ego off of, for example, he hooks up with a chick in order to comfort her about her brother being shot in a school shooting, and he hooks up with another woman by talking about how pretty her make up is after she confesses to him that someone sexually assaulted her. There's literally no character development of anyone in this book.

It's obviously an attempt at explaining what it feels like to be the weird outcast guy that no one understands or likes, but it's not done well. There's so much ""fake deep"" in this book, it feels like it was written by an incel that felt someones boob once, and now feels like he's the most bad ass alpha male in the world. And that's not just me saying that, the protagonist in the book often calls himself an alpha male, and compares human desires to animal desires, while going on long drawn out rants about how meaningless life is, and how dumb everyone is, and how he's the only one that ""gets it"".

He's also extremely violent, without real consequence, throughout the book. He assaults two different men in this book for hitting on his current love interest in some way. One touches her hip and says hello, so the protagonist decided to break his arm. The next is later in the book after the protagonist joins the airforce. A man walks up to his girlfriend, and says he wants to fuck her, so the protagonist breaks this dudes knee and pulls out his eyeball. Nothing happens to him for either of these actions, because plot armor. He never grows or learns anything. He seems to live for two reasons, to stroke his own dick about how much smarter he is than everyone else, and to bang chicks with no real personality or thoughts while also taking advantage of the traumatic situations he puts them in.

If i didn't know better I would honestly believe this book was satire. It mocks itself almost at every turn. But after doing some research about the author, I honestly believe this book was some kind of honest attempt at some form of reflective work. And was an earnest attempt at writing."
This Is Why I Hate You,Nicola,"February 21, 2016",3.0,"I read this when it first came out back in September (3 months ago) I still haven't quite figured out if it's meant to be a joke or actually taken seriously. Which is why it has taken me so long to actually try review it. I can only hope it was meant as a joke.

I tried the sample first and thought it was great since I was going through an ""I hate everything and everyone"" stage, I bought the full book and even as arrogant and obnoxious as I was and can be, even I was very quickly disgusted.

I honestly don't remember why I gave the first book 5 stars, but this was like a (bad) copy of it. I'm very willing to suspend any disbelief while reading, but even I struggled with this one. One example
Just, what even??

As for the main character, what a horrible human being.


If this was written as an example of how NOT to behave, I may believe that, but knowing who wrote it, well...Don't get me wrong here, Onision has helped me sometimes with his videos, but I have to say, if this book is serious and he wants people to pay to read it, then I don't think he has much right to be constantly laughing at and making fun of others. Just saying..

I'm almost afraid to even post this, just thinking of that, but well, I've written this much already. Let him tweet this, laugh, whatever. See if I care. In my defence, I want to say that I'm not saying I can write myself, in fact I actually deleted my two published books as I didn't think anyone should have to pay to read such crap. Not that I'm saying Onision's books are crap, I mean I kept on reading, just, I don't even know. As horrible as I can be to people myself at times, this book just scares me. And makes me want to hide and never want to speak to speak to anyone again, ever. Even more so that I already do...

Just changed my rating (added two stars) because I hate everyone too. Except Onision. Sometimes."

I think that even if you do not agree with how the author or the character view the world, the book is still entertaining, and opens your eyes on some topics pertaining to the military, and poly-amorous relationships.

So Onision is bad at writing good characters. Maybe he'll write a good evil character! It's probably closer to home, and they say to write what you know! Let's do an exercise. Start listing your favorite evil characters. If you're me, you'll start thinking of Mrs. Coulter from Pullman's His Dark Materials series, Walter White from Breaking Bad, Hannibal Lecter, the Duke of Ferrara, Count Cenci, the Joker, Magneto, Negan from The Walking Dead, Father Comstock from Bioshock Infinite, maybe, or Father Joseph, if you're more of a Far Cry fan. I've got a soft spot for Steven King, so let's throw Pennywise and the Pet Sematary demon in there, too. What makes them interesting? Complex psychological processes, unnerving similarities to ourselves juxtaposed with bizarre and unpredictable behavior, recognizable quirks and personalities, sure. But all of those things fall under the heading of one thing: GOOD WRITING. Something Gerg is incapable of.
Let's start at the beginning. The main character is another intolerable little teenage asshole who hates fucking everyone and everything. He hates his dad because he drives him to school, is vegetarian, and believes in God. I'm no Bible-thumper, but this kid can't go two sentences without taking a shit on religion. He has a dead mom, who taught him how to fight and to never feel sorry for himself. Apparently she didn't do either of those things very well, because this dude is a chronic victim and gets in three fights: he gets his tooth pounded out in the first, and wins by snapping the guy's arm at the elbow, an ungentlemanly move at any rate, and ends the third with a hatchet buried in his cerebrum. Spoiler alert. He wins the second by clawing out the eye of a dude who stood too close to his girlfriend. He hates his dad's girlfriend because she's fat, and he can't go two fcking seconds without mentioning it.
Like James, Arthur thinks he's better than everyone else, simply by dint of being an atheist, a non-sports fan, and a huge fucking misanthrope. He has a girlfriend, who he manipulates into dressing like a goth in a show of ""loyalty"" and letting him fuck her raw. Because Greg's gross fucking pregnancy fetish has to make it into a book about seventeen year olds. Also, the girlfriend, Ashley, is SO EXCITED to fuck Arthur that she has to run around the house before they do the deed, like your dog doing laps around the living room because you asked him if he wanted to go for a walk. No one has ever been that excited to see Gerg's weiner. Ever. I guaran-damn-tee it.
If this book just took a direction and ran with it, it might have the potential to reach mediocrity. I'm interested in psychology and the dark side of humanity, and I thought a person with antisocial leanings sublimating their desire for violence by joining the military was an interesting concept. Sort of a Dexter ripoff, but cool nonetheless. But Gerg vacillates wildly between proclaiming how DARK and EDGY Arthur is and ham-fistedly suggesting that SOCIETY is the real evil, and Arthur is the only sane man in a world of blind fools. For a serious example, Arthur, who hates everyone and thinks all humans should die, except for him (and maybe a girl he can put his raw, shriveled dick into), is the only Air Force trainee to stop a (virtual) suicide risk from pulling the trigger. How does he accomplish this wonder? He tells him that he has so much to live for! To be fair, if Arthur tried to stop me from killing myself, I'd listen. I would not only pull the gun out of myself to shoot him first, I'd empty the clip just to make sure that fucker was dead for reals. For a stupid example, when Arthur gets in a fight with John, a jock, Greg censors the word ""pussy."" In a book filled with graphic descriptions of underage unprotected sex, eye attacks, brutal violence, murder, attempted rape, and countless savage insults about characters' weight, gender, appearances, religion, and place of birth, the word ""pussy"" is too offensive. That's like Jeffery Dahmer refusing to eat a hitchhiker with a salad fork.
The book's pacing is unbelievably jerky, skipping forwards months or even a year at a time. It's formatted like a diary, which is stupid, because Arthur is always breaking the fourth wall, which a diary doesn't have, and explaining stupid shit to the reader, which diaries aren't supposed to have, and every entry begins with ""IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I'VE WRITTEN."" Put a goddamn date. This herky-jerkiness is a sign of an inexperienced, easily bored writer who doesn't want to bother with world-building or character development, and wants to skip straight to the action. There is no balance between plot and character development, which could be a little forgivable if the plot wasn't so goddamn stupid. Some books are character-heavy, where the plot fades into the background, like Beckett's plays (I'm thinking of ""Endgame"" and ""Krapp's Last Tape"" in particular. Some books have incredibly intricate plots and employ some more lightly rendered characters, like The Lord of the Rings or His Dark Materials. In This is Why I Hate You, neither of these aspects was given any care. The humor is a mix between the Fred videos my little brother made me watch in the early 2000s and a scientific study on the theoretical limits of cleverness. I did not care for it.
People have been comparing this to fan fiction. Let me be clear: when I was an undergrad, I came home and, after a night of restless sleep, found a small binder under my mattress. My younger sister had filled it with Supernatural fan fiction she had printed out and she had forgotten to move it. Every single one of those incest-pornography and cliché filled printouts had more artistic merit and more care put into it than all of Onision's books combined, and I will repeat this assertion to anyone, anywhere, anytime. I have honed the skills I learned within the fan community. For every twelve year old on Wattpad trying to use Sonic the Hedgehog to come to terms with their budding sexuality is a promising writer editing their work, honing their craft, and producing a product they're proud of.

This Is Why I Hate You,Lee,"July 3, 2019",1.0,"If I were to describe this book and as few words as possible I would describe it as ""power fantasy turned pure cringe"", because that's what it comes off as.

Arthur is probably one of the most detestable characters I've ever read about, and I've read about some detestable characters. it's also very clear that the character is a self insert for the author.

I did some research on the author and a good chunk of events that happened to Arthur were taken straight from the author's life (his father attacking him, joining the air Force and being stationed in Oklahoma and Korea, ect). It really comes off as someone trying to rewrite their lives to make themselves seem ""cooler"" and ""more badass"" than they actually are.

The protagonist goes on long egotistical unlikable rants against fat people, religious people, vegetarians, vegans, sports fans, ect. at one point he talks about having a fantasy about a bomb going off at a sporting event and killing the people there, because his father likes sports. That's it. It's extremely psychopathic.

It really does seem like Arthur (by extension of the author) gets off on violence. Not only does he fantasize about violence (the sport event bombing) but he constantly goes way beyond what is reasonable in terms of his violence towards others. I think the red suit example is probably the most egregious.

The red suit is a military simulation where guy is wearing a big padded red suit. The recruits are told to try and beat him, and if they do they don't have to do the rest of their 48hr training mission.

Arthur decides to take a baton (that he wasn't supposed to have and seemingly materializes out of nowhere) and jam it into the trainers face mask and kick it in with all of his strength, breaking his nose. Arthur then decides to continue beating the crap out of those trainer and break his trainers ankle. This goes well beyond what is reasonable. The worst part is Arthur acts like it is normal to break people's bones during training exercises and acts like a victim when people view him negatively for acting like a violent crazy person.

I'm not even going to get into the rest of the fetishization of violence, the offensively used topic of sexual assault, the fetishization of lesbian women or the clear hatred towards women that comes through in the text because it's been gone over so often in the reviews below that would be basically beating a dead horse.

In short, don't read this book. The author is a terrible person (apparently he even makes videos mocking negative reviews towards his crappy books) and the book is awful and not at all enjoyable to read."
This Is Why I Hate You,Morgan Taylor,"October 6, 2019",1.0,"Absolute shit, was there even an editor?
Does Greg know how to use spellcheck? No.
Greg writes this book as if he believes he is a true artist and gift to this world. The skills of writing do not exist, as it is hard to believe Greg could have passed an introductory high school English /grammar class.
If you are a 12 year old who watches YouTube and would like Greg to attempt to groom you into believing abusive people are victims, this book it for you.
If you have intelligence, pride or common sense, you will avoid anything written by Greg aka “Onision”.
This book is a sad excuse for literature, I don’t even think it deserves to be called that. It is a abusive person trying to gain support from the public while currently facing multiple legal battles, criminal charges and public accusation from 10+ people (over half were minors during their interactions with him$ for sexual harassment, stalking and domestic abuse/violence. He is a high risk individual who is trying to convince his underage fan club that his misogynistic sociopathic tendencies are okay. He is also actively trying to convince himself this.

Return to the Secret Garden,Manybooks,"January 29, 2020",1.0,"I do not (and this thankfully so) remember all that much about Susan Moody's Return to the Secret Garden except that I indeed have found it absolutely and totally horrid and consider it a massive and unforgivable insult to both Frances Hodgson Burnett and anyone who has read and loved The Secret Garden.

Now indeed, I would not have minded if the author, if Susan Moody had altered her featured characters somewhat (I mean, children do grow up, and they do change), and I would also not have even minded some controversial, adult topics appearing in . However, Susan Moody changing Colin into a bisexual, who calls out Dickons's name while being intimate with Mary and so on and so on was and still is not in any even conceivable way my idea of a remotely acceptable sequel to by any stretch of the (of my) imagination.

And yes, for those individuals (for those readers) who might try to claim that Susan Moody's writing is interesting and that one should give this book a chance, well, I really did try to give more than a chance. But the massive changes to the characters (characters whom I adore, and to whom I have always had an almost magical attachment) and the fact that the novel tends to read rather like a cheap and gossipy trash-romance has made me despise to such an extent that I truly and honestly never was really even able to notice or more to the point care all that much about the author's writing style, about Susan Moody's narrative flow, word building etc., so massively angered was I at and by the contents, the themes (and indeed, is also one of the very few books that I actually ever seriously considered burning or tossing into the garbage).

I thus would honestly NOT recommend to anyone, but especially if you are a true fan of Frances Hodgson Burnett's , you should totally and absolutely avoid like the proverbial plague (as it, as the story presented will likely anger you in much the same way it has angered and infuriated me). And please note that this is my personal opinion. And finally, if there are readers who have actually and in fact enjoyed , that is absolutely fine and not in any way a problem for me (but personally, I have vehemently despised and continue to despise as one of the most distasteful and frustrating pieces of groan-worthy junk I have ever read)."
Return to the Secret Garden,Taxandria,"June 20, 2009",1.0,"The Secret Garden is one of my very much beloved books, a testament to a more innocent time, a story of life, healing, forgiveness and the triumph over evil, depression and grief. The characters are described so well, you feel you know them inside and out when you're finished reading the book.

I wonder if Susan Moody ever read The Secret Garden, because she has these characters doing things I just can't even imagine them doing. The motivations are all contrived to suit the author's insistence on tawdriness. She seems to crank open your brain and pour into it all the vile things promoted in the past few decades: adultery, death in graphic description, angst, disrespect, lust, selfishness, and sickness. The opposite of what the Secret Garden is about.

The writing is fine, the mechanics are there, but the characters are not Mary, Dickon, and Colin. I can't see Colin calling out Dickon's name while he's in an intimate situation with Mary. I also had a hard time believing Colin was gay or bisexual. I also had a hard time believing Mary just fell into bed with Dickon with no commentary on how she professed her feelings for him or vice versa. I don't understand Dickon patronizing prostitutes, or having an affair with Mary while she is married to someone else. I don't see Mary jumping into marriage with a guy she hardly knows, when we ALL KNOW her heart is really with Dickon. Or that she would be having sex with a man while her baby dies outside. Good God did the crud never END?

These characters were shameful. They seemed driven by evil itself, driven to destroy all the nurturing and life giving health the Secret Garden developed in them in the first book.

Too much time was spent describing Dickon's war experiences. I don't need to know that much about wounds, blood and maggots, thank you. Of course he was given Post Traumatic Stress disorder, because I believe the author couldn't think of anything else to flesh out his character with. Perhaps consulting the original book would give Ms. Moody a clue on how Dickon would have acted and spoken (anyone else notice his entire dialect was erased? Was it too much to ask that Moody preserve one of those charming things about this boy? I know it's a lot of research, but she could have gone the distance and at least shown us that she cared enough to try!)

I bought this book hoping for a continuation of the characters I truly loved from the original book, but what I witnessed here was their systematic pop-culture slaughter.

This could have been a beautiful story about real love and friendship and bonds that we form in life. Instead, the characters were forced to turn away from the peace they'd achieved in the original story.

They can grow up and learn about the horrors of life without contributing to them. This is bad finfic and should have only been published somewhere in the dark recesses of the internet. I can't believe a publisher paid for this. I can't believe I did, either."

Return to the Secret Garden,Allie,"May 15, 2012",1.0,"This book is appalling. It's a sexed up (not to mention messed up) fan fiction of a true classic, which I might add is a children's story. I didn't expect to pick this up and have it be the exact polar opposite of what The Secret Garden was.

TSG was a coming-into-oneself story in the springtime. A short parcel of time, easily digestible and sweet. Great read, especially for girls. Sequels in general are meant to hold the same mood and tone of the first books- this is a given. Moody's syntax was similar to Burnetts, and honestly I commend that- it's difficult to do well. But the mood of Burnett's innocent little heartwarmer compared to the ups-and-downs roller coaster ride of the ""sequel"" is disgusting. If I didn't have a bookworm's commitment to see how she ended up hashing them all together at the end, I would throw it away right this minute. I marked this as ""read"", only because I'm so close to finishing that I'll probably be done with this stupid thing by tonight (thank goodness).

""Didn't like"" is an understatement. If you've read The Secret Garden and treasure it, don't read this. If you're passive about it, do so if only for the sake that it's written okay and you're bound to want to chuck a rock at it- which is the intended point of literature, anyway. Finally, if you haven't read The Secret Garden, you missed out on some childhood. :)"

Why I continued reading until the end, I can only suppose was because I needed some sort of closure. While The Secret Garden is a beloved children’s book, this is a book NO child should ever read, nor should anyone else. I cannot begin to imagine why Susan Moody chose to bestow the horrors of her writing upon Burnett’s readers. For, I assure you, Moody is no Burnett: she is the opposite of.

Of course the magic was no longer there as the children aged and moved into adulthood but the characters were well crafted and believable and I was held in suspense from beginning to end.... and I didn't walk away decrying the book and thinking it blasphemy for not doing some kind of justice to the lives of Mary, Colin and Dicken....

Return to the Secret Garden,Claudia,"July 11, 2012",2.0,"The essence of a sequel book is that the characters you knew in the initial book are extended into the sequel.

Maybe I like happier endings with less trauma and drama...but it was set such that the three would become adults during the first and second world wars in England.

Perhaps, if it had been a book with completely independent characters, independent and unconnected to the original story, it would have been a better read, because there are elements of the story that were very good - but not genuine to the characters.

I can see how the author's talent for her other genres/works - which include a crime and a thriller series - were woven into what might have been a good read, again, had it been about other characters vs Mary, Colin, and Dickon, of the beloved Secret Garden."

Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Kressel Housman,"June 23, 2008",1.0,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a fan in search of a good sequel can safely skip anything by Emma Tennant. She gets the language pretty well (except for ""must needs,"" which I never read anywhere in JA) and she puts in a few melt-worthy Darcy/Lizzy scenes, but the overall plot annoyed me, particularly with the insinuation about Bingley, which was just a foil to raise Lizzy's suspicions against Darcy. So as I said, Jane Austen fans, skip this one. You'll find better sequels in the wide world of fanfic."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Julie,"March 1, 2009",1.0,"I honestly am shocked that any publishing company actually published this. I think Jane Austen, herself, would despise Emma Tennant's idea of what Elizabeth Bennet Darcy was like after a year of marriage with Mr. Darcy.

The book was not true to the characters that Jane Austen created in Pride and Prejudice. Even as far as slandering poor Mr. Bingley, that is if a fiction character can be slandered.

The story was ridiculous. Elizabeth was weak minded, insecure, and foolish. The story was not believable and I can hardly believe I read the whole thing. I was so shocked by the author's misintrepretation of Pride and Prejudice that I kept reading.

I would love to hear other P&P fans to tell me their thoughts on this book if they read it. However, it is not worth your time."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Laurel,"January 8, 2014",3.0,"If you can, take yourself back to 1993. Some of you reading this review were not even born yet, so bear with me. Imagine the Jane Austen universe pre Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy emerging soaking wet from Pemberley pond in the 1995 A&E/BBC miniseries Pride and Prejudice. No dripping Darcy. No thousands of Jane Austen-inspired prequels, sequels and inspired-by novels and self-help books brimming book shelves at your local bookstore. No buy-it-now button at your favorite online retailer. No INTERNET for that matter! You have read Pride and Prejudice (multiple times) and seen both the adaptations: the 1940 movie starring Laurence Olivier and the 1980 BBC mini-series starring David Rintoul on Masterpiece Theatre. You are violently in love with Jane Austen’s novel and know of no one else who shares your obsession — and then one day you are in a bookstore and see , by Emma Tennant. You stare at it in total disbelief. Could someone else continue the story of your beloved Elizabeth and Darcy? Could you be back at Pemberley again?

Now that you have a closer understanding of the environment that Tennant’s brave foray into Jane Austen sequeldom entered in 1993, and what anticipation the reader might have felt, you will have a greater appreciation of its tepid reception. When the vast majority read this book they delusionally expected Jane Austen, again. How could they possibly not be disappointed? By the time I read it in 2002 it had gotten a bad rap all-around by media reviewers and pleasure readers. My first impressions were not positive either. Now, after eleven years of reading numerous -inspired novels that have been published in its wake — I have re-read it with an entirely new perspective — with an open heart and a sense of humor.

It has been almost a year since the happy day in which Mrs. Bennet got rid of two of her most deserving daughters. Elizabeth Darcy nee Bennet is learning the ropes of being the chatelaine of Pemberley House while obsessing over her insecurities and lack of producing an heir. Her dear father has died and his entailed estate of Longbourn has passed on to his cousin Mr. Collins and his wife Charlotte. The displaced Mrs. Bennet and her two unmarried daughters Mary and Kitty have taken up residence at Meryton Lodge, their new home not far from Longbourn and neighbors Mrs. Long and Lady Lucas. Elizabeth’s elder sister Jane and her husband Charles Bingley have purchased an estate in Yorkshire thirty miles from Pemberley. After four years of marriage they have one daughter and another on the way. Thoughtless younger sister Lydia, her ner-do-well husband George Wickham and their four children are continually in debt and an embarrassment to Elizabeth and her family.

The holidays are approaching and the plans for the annual festivities will include gathering family at Pemberley for Christmas and a New Year’s Ball. Besides Georgiana, Mr. Darcy’s younger sister, the guest list is growing out-of-control. Even under the care of her capable housekeeper Mrs. Reynolds, Elizabeth is overwhelmed. Included are Elizabeth’s family: some welcome and others not. Mrs. Bennet, Mary and Kitty will make their first visit to Pemberley. Jane will also journey with her husband and his sisters Miss Caroline Bingley, Mrs. Hurst and her husband. Elizabeth’s favorite Uncle and Aunt Gardiner have let a house nearby so that the unwelcome George Wickham and his family can visit with Mrs. Bennet. Also on the guest list is Mr. Darcy’s officious Aunt Lady Catherine de Bourgh who disapproved of Darcy’s choice of bride but seems to have mended the fence enough for an extended stay. Arriving with her is her unmarried daughter Anne and the heir to the Pemberley estate, a distant cousin of Lady Catherine, Master Thomas Roper. Shortly before Mrs. Bennet is to depart for Pemberley she reveals to her friend Mrs. Long that even though Mr. Bennet departed this life but nine months ago, she intends to marry Colonel Kitchiner, a cousin and a crush from her youth whose father was a business partner of her father in Meryton. She has invited him to Pemberley as well — so it is a full house of unlikely companionship for its new mistress.

Any fans of will recognize the irony of the guest list. The back story from the original novel and the combination of personalities is a set-up for the conflicts that inevitably arrive even before the guests do. Tennant has fudged on the facts from the original novel which were a bit off-putting. I remember being irked by this the first time around, and the second time did not sit as well either. Jane and Elizabeth were married on the same day in , yet she chose to have Elizabeth marry Mr. Darcy four years after the original event — and how could any author writing a sequel or any historical novel set in the Regency-era not understand the ins and outs of British primogeniture? Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s cousin Thomas Roper, also the cousin of Mr. Darcy’s mother Ann, could not be the heir to Pemberley. If so, it would mean that the Darcy family and his mother a Fitzwilliam were related in earlier generations. This is possible but highly confusing to the reader who may understand the English inheritance laws, or not.

Quibbles in continuity and cultural history aside, my second impressions of were much more favorable — at least I didn’t despise it anymore. With the exception of Elizabeth Bennet being overly angst ridden and atypically un-spirited, I enjoyed Tennant’s characterizations of the delightfully dotty Mrs. Bennet and the slippery Bingley sisters. My biggest disappointment remained with the male characters. We see all of the action through Elizabeth’s eyes, and since she is uncertain and overly grateful of Darcy’s love, their relationship is strained and unpleasant. He is proud again and given nothing to say, and she is too unprejudiced to do anything about it. Tennant excelled most with her new creations: Mr. Gresham, Thomas Roper and the hysterical Col. Kitchiner who rivals the odious Mr. Collins (thankfully not invited to Pemberley) in the role of buffoon.

I appreciate Tennant much more as a writer than I did at first reading. It was interesting to put into a wider perspective after many years. She was helping to create a new genre in which many would follow. This first attempt, though seriously flawed, merits some respect and congratulations. It is a must read for any ardent Austenesque fan, but most will be disappointed.

Ostensibly a sequel to Austen's beloved Pride and Prejudice , Tennant's narrative of the beginning of Mr. and Mrs. Darcy's marriage strains my ability to suspend disbelief to the breaking point. How is it possible that Darcy has returned to being the cold, distant ass? Wasn't his transformation into a more humane person one of the major themes of the original? And when did Elizabeth Bennett change from a confident young woman, willing to speak her mind to the insufferable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, to the cowed, insecure woman we see here?

If you love Jane Austen, value good writing, or simply don't like to have your time wasted, I would advise you to steer clear of . I myself regret that I invested the time in reading it, and wouldn't want my fellow readers to make the same mistake. Jane Austen is dead ladies, and no amount of wishful thinking is going to expand her oeuvre.

: I am simply aghast to learn that Ms. Tennant, in addition to butchering the wonderful , has also turned her dubious talents to the task of rewriting . Now that is just wrong!"
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Kortney,"November 27, 2007",1.0,"I read this story not long after reading ""Pride & Prejudice"" for the first time. I did not like it, but mostly because it stirred up conflict between Elizabeth & Darcy and cast a darkness over their marriage. I think that Austen needs no sequel."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Lynn,"July 20, 2016",1.0,"This was one of the 1st P&P sequels I read many years ago. I recently gave it a reread to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was. I was going to go for a 3rd read for the P&P challenge, but just couldn't do it.

The biggest problem with Pemberley is the ""wimpification"" of Elizabeth. Emma Tennant has the woman who said ""There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me;"" for whom ""the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation"" unsure of her home, of how to act and even of her husband! This Elizabeth is intimidated by the barbs of the Bigley sisters (HUH?) and she reacts with ""extreme despondency"" at the prospect of Jane and her family coming to Christmas at Pemberley. Who is this person???

Tennent makes many mistakes in the canon that are obviously not deliberate plot changes, just laziness or unconcern. By setting the bar for Austen para-literature so low, Tennant hasn't done us any favors. I give this a ""Don't Bother."""
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Barb,"April 3, 2011",1.0,"What an awful book! I have exclaimed over the explicit sexual P&P sequels, but this makes me realize there is another way to write poorly. Elizabeth and Darcy are having everyone ever mentioned in P&P to Pemberley for Christmas. Elizabeth is a bit uneasy about her role of Mistress of Pemberley, and that is to be understood. But, Elizabeth experiences dismay, regret, anxiety, annoyance, insult, embarrassment, uncertainty, disdain, etc. throughout the entire book. There is NO LET UP. The strong woman of sense we met in P&P is unable to find anything amusing about her guests or her situation. There is no comic relief - at least we are not given to see anyone finding the humor in their time at Pemberley. Even Georgiana turns against her and giggles about her with Caroline Bingley. Now, Mr. Darcy does absolutely nothing to encourage or support Elizabeth. In fact, he finds he never has a chance to speak to her and leaves her wondering all the time where he is, what he is doing, and why he is making the decisions he is. There is no one to like in this book. There is no one to admire. There is no one to enjoy time with. We simply have a crushingly depressing book putting every character from P&P, plus a couple more, in the most terrible light. Well, except Jane, but she is little to no comfort to Elizabeth, at least she does appear to. There is just nothing to enjoy in this book. The author, I believe, thinks there is humor. Do you find it funny that Lady Catherine continues to insult Elizabeth and her family, and even Darcy joins in? Do you find it funny that Caroline Bingley is able to insult Elizabeth left and right and even involve Georgiana in her cruel laughter? Do you find it funny that Kitty finds Pemberley boring, and when she sees Lydia reverts back to exactly the same person she was before Lydia's marriage? Do you find it funny that Wickham is invited for the day and ends up spending several due to a snow storm? Do you find it funny that Lady Catherine insists she be given her own place to entertain away from the Bennet family because Elizabeth's mother is so vulgar? Okay, kids, if you find this funny, you will be laughing out loud while reading this book. For me, it was a day of pain which I felt for Elizabeth and Darcy. In addition, I could not understand any of the actions they chose. Finally, the resolution at the end that brings them back together is so short and unsatisfactory, I could not believe there was not a sequel to this book. All in all, I wouldn't wish this book on anyone who has ever loved Pride and Prejudice."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Katherine,"August 28, 2014",1.0,"Sadly I had to agree with all the other reviewers.. This book was upsetting as I cannot imagine Elizabeth and Darcy having these types of communication issues with each other after a year of marriage. Misunderstandings amount to an excessive degree and every time Elizabeth perceives something in Darcy that reminds her of his prideful nature he does something that pieces how much he loves her and yet she distrusts him which is frustrating! Darcy doesn't have many lines in this novel but they were all loving towards Elizabeth - how can she doubt his feelings? Why would she believe overheard conversations lady Catherine has with Caroline? And why wouldn't she just talk to Darcy about her feelings especially when she has an opportunity although that conversation frustrating me cause Darcy attempted to humour her out of her sober mood but when he realized that she misunderstood the situation why wouldn't he defend himself and open up to Elizabeth about the truth? Darcy trying to protect her sister is a sore excuse for causing marital issues with his own wife! Although I was frustrated at Elizabeth for not talking to Darcy I was even more frustrated with Darcy when he just picks up and leaves for London and then Elizabeth does the same thing - that's when it got even more ridiculous. And then we get to the final chapter and realize the author will summarize the reconciliation into one paragraph was lacking in depth and didn't do justice to all the animosity and hurt that had built up by the end.
Side note - I don't think Georgiana's character would have enjoyed Caroline's sarcasm as portrayed in this novel and Jane Austen wouldn't have approved of Bingleys past being how it was portrayed. I also don't think Darcy would call his wife Eliza as she was only called that by Caroline in the original. Elizabeth had ample proof of Darcy's love for her and I think any insecurities she had of not yet conceiving a child would never have caused her to make up so many hypothetical issues with her marriage especially with Jane's advice not to misjudge Darcy as she had in the past mistakenly done."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Susan in Perthshire,"September 25, 2017",1.0,Every other review has covered the minutiae of how awful this book is. I can add nothing: - a sentiment Emma Tennant would have done well to remember before writing this travesty.

Come al solito, non sono una persona che si scandalizza davanti ad un sequel o ad uno spin-off. L’autrice può inventare quello che le pare, purché cerchi di restare quanto più fedele possibile a Jane Austen. Però esigo che l’autrice sia preparata, che conosca l’argomento di cui tratta in modo che non si possano cogliere imprecisioni.
Ed effettivamente questo sequel non è peggio di tanti altri dal punto di vista delle , con Mrs Bennet, ormai vedova con un pretendente (un po’ ), Elizabeth che non riesce ancora a dare un erede a Darcy ed è pertanto un po’ preoccupata (anche grazie alla comparsa di un lontano cugino che erediterebbe Pemberley qualora l’unione fra Elizabeth e Darcy rimanesse sterile), e con tutti i personaggi riuniti nel Derbyshire per le Feste di Natale.
Ripeto, non mi scandalizzo!
Ma quando leggo una serie di castronerie dietro l’altra (ne ho appuntate ben 23 sulle note a margine con relativi commenti), una per tutte:



quando sappiamo benissimo che Anne De Bourgh sa suonare il pianoforte! (Sarebbe stata un'esperta se non avesse avuto problemi di salute - a detta di sua madre Lady Catherine)!,

penso: come mai la Tennant ha deciso di scrivere il sequel di ?
Perché a me sembra quasi come se la Tennant fosse una ragazzina di scuola media (neanche tanto brava) costretta dall’insegnante a leggere il e poi a scrivere quella che secondo lei sarebbe potuta essere una giusta continuazione. La ragazzina, avendo letto il libro appena una volta ha delle frasi che le sono rimaste impresse (), altre cose che le sono poco chiare, o che non ricorda bene per via della lettura un po’ frettolosa. Ma dico io, se hai dei dubbi: controlla! Non puoi stravolgere età, nomi, relazioni fra i personaggi…

Il finale poi è rocambolesco, una giravolta di personaggi che si spostano da Manchester a Meryton, da Longbourn a Barlow (la nuova residenza dei Bingley), da Londra a Pemberley nel giro di mezza giornata, con finale a sorpresa e la Tennant, forse stanca di dire corbellerie, che decide di concludere in fretta e furia (proprio come una studentessa di scuola media, appunto)!

Forse si può giustificare la Tennant pensando che è stata una delle prime “scrittrici” ad occuparsi di questo filone (che si è poi rivelato un , che ormai sfruttano tutti, basta scrivere la parolina magica ed il libro si vende), quindi ha affrontato il suo compito del tutto impreparata…

[NOTE A MARGINE]

1- Delle cinque figlie dei Bennet, tre si sposano nell'ordine di precedenza che la madre avrebbe auspicato: Elizabeth, la seconda, con Mr Darcy, signore di Pemberley House nel Derbyshire, con una rendita di diecimila sterline l'anno; Jane, la maggiore, con Mr Bingley e la sua rendita di cinque o seimila sterline l'anno; infine Lydia, fuggita con l'affascinante ma inaffidabile Mr Wickham.



2- Lydia, la terza Bennet a essersi sposata,...



3- La ragazza, che aveva qualche anno più di sua sorella Mary ed era più alta di Elizabeth stessa,...



4- Georgiana, che a soli quindici anni aveva subito l'umiliazione di un tentato rapimento da parte di un cacciatore di dote, considerava con scarsa fiducia la possibilità di trovare marito.




5- Lydia sa che non c'è alcuna zia Gardiner da andare a trovare e sa anche che Rowsley si trova a cinque miglia da Pemberley
pag.47
che zia Gardiner aveva preso casa a Rowsley per poter visitare meglio la zona e che la sorella Lydia avrebbe trovato Lambton molto adatto per la sua numerosa figliolanza.




6- ""Mr Wickham non è mai piaciuto a Mr Darcy, fin da quand'erano ragazzi.""



7- Kitty, quando non stava da Jane o a volte a Pemberley, si trovava, come in quel momento, a Lyme dalla zia Philips.




8- Miss Bingley aveva perfino commentato che i ritratti dei membri della famiglia di Elizabeth avrebbero sfigurato accanto ai Darcy nella galleria di casa, ma suo marito aveva ribattuto promettendo di chiamare a Pemberley un pittore che eseguisse un ritratto di Elizabeth da sola e un altro ancora della moglie accanto agli zii. Quest'ultimo sarebbe stato appeso vicino al prozio di Mr Darcy, giudice della Corte Suprema.





9- ""Ditemi,"" esclamò Mrs Hurst, ""a parte vostra madre e le vostre sorelle, inviterete anche le zie? Ho sentito che ne avete una che vive a Cheapside."" E qui Mrs Hurst scoppiò in una risata di cuore. ""E un bel viaggio da Cheapside a Pemberley, ma a tutte noi spiacerebbe sentire che ha percorso una simile distanza solo per ritrovarsi ospite di Mrs Gardiner a Rowsley, proprio come Mrs Wickham.""



10- ""Infatti, il colonnello è stato a lungo in guerra e adesso si è ritirato a Uplyme. Un luogo incantevole, devo dire. Lo visitai con il mio povero marito quando Lydia andò a Weymouth, se ben ricordate.""



11- ""No, Darcy, sapevo che la cosa non ti avrebbe interessato, ma è che io ho invitato Caroline qui per Natale. Questo è tutto e,"" aggiunse in tono di sfida nel silenzio che aveva accolto la notizia, ""comunque Miss Bingley non è come la sorella, Mrs Hurst.""
""No, è molto peggio,"" ribatté Elizabeth. ""Credo proprio, Georgiana, che dovresti chiedere a me prima di invitare qualcuno in casa."" Si alzò con le guance in fiamme e disse che era ora di andare a letto.






12- ""Non le avevamo ancora nemmeno chiesto di disegnare la carta di Wickham,"" disse serissimo Darcy, abbandonandosi a una battuta crudele, che Elizabeth gli dimostrò comunque, con un sorriso e un abbraccio, di aver apprezzato.

O_O



13- ""Dopo cena Anne ci rallegrerà con le sue nuove canzoni al pianoforte,"" annunciò Lady Catherine, lanciando un'occhiata allo strumento.




14- ""Ci giocavamo insieme, cara Georgiana,"" le ricordò Miss Bingley, ""quando venivo a Pemberley."" E lanciò un'occhiata a Mr Darcy.
Le due ragazze risero al ricordo, poi un valletto annunciò che la cena era pronta e si avviarono tutti in sala da pranzo.





15- ""Io preferirei ballare,"" propose Elizabeth, di ottimo umore. ""E credo che lo stesso valga per Anne e Georgiana.""
Le ragazze sorrisero di sollievo a quel suggerimento e Miss Bingley si offrì di suonare per loro. ""Tanto non durerà molto,"" assicurò, ""perché Mr Darcy detesta poche cose al mondo come il ballo. Ricordo anzi che una volta a Netherfield, mia cara Mrs Darcy, mentre scriveva una lettera alla sorella, ci suggerì proprio di ballare per tenerci occupate e non distrarlo.""





16- Oltre tutto, la presenza a Pemberley di Miss Caroline Bingley e di Miss de Bourgh, due ragazze che avrebbe potuto sposare, gli ricorderà che a quest'ora potrebbe essere circondato da un esercito di bambini!""




17- Non era stata proprio la zia a esclamare, durante la prima visita a Pemberley, che le sarebbe piaciuto moltissimo girare per il parco su una carrozza scoperta?



18- Elizabeth ricordava il rimpianto provato durante la prima visita a Pemberley, quando aveva rifiutato la mano di Darcy pur essendone già innamorata, al pensiero che non avrebbe mai avuto il piacere di essere la signora di un luogo tanto incantevole.
Ma poi al rimpianto si era sostituito il sollievo, al pensiero che in quel caso non avrebbe mai dovuto invitarvi gli zii, e non le era più parsa una grande perdita.



19- ...se il matrimonio dei suoi genitori non si fosse deteriorato tanto tristemente e Mrs Bennet non fosse diventata il continuo bersaglio dei lazzi del padre, forse la sua natura non sarebbe stata così sciocca e vuota.



20- Adesso chiede consiglio a Lady de Bourgh su come comportarsi con i poveri zii Gardiner, che non vorrebbero mai vivere della sua carità perché sono gente onesta e orgogliosa.





21- ""Oh, come mi piacerebbe andare a Londra,"" esclamò Georgiana nel tono speranzoso dei suoi diciassette anni.



22- Mrs Moffat era stata la governante di casa, all'epoca di Mr Bennet (si parla di Longbourn)




23- ""Spero che a Londra vedrai Mr Darcy.""
""No, andrò dalla zia Philips, se sarà tanto gentile da ospitarmi,"" fu la risposta.

Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Laurie Allen,"December 11, 2015",1.0,"WARNING: stay away from this book. Far, far away. Also, spoilers may be involved.

I rarely rate or review a book. Even if it's really good. I leave it for my blog. But this one. This was just too disappointing in so many levels, for so many reasons. I really thought I would like this book. I mean Berdoll had so many bad reviews but I actually enjoyed the series. Maybe this wouldn't be any different. Maybe you're thinking of the same thing.

No. Stay FAR away.

First off, I know that the author wanted to challenge the readers' perception of Elizabeth and Darcy's married life, add a sense of realism. Sure. And I know that the times and social obligations then were different than they are now. I get it. But my main problem was with the characters themselves. It's like Darcy and Elizabeth (Lizzy especially) have learned nothing in the original book. NOTHING. Darcy should know how touchy Elizabeth can be on the subject of her family and that she had a habit of forming conclusions without all of the facts. And Elizabeth should know better than to believe everything everyone else says as fact. All the time I was reading, I couldn't help shouting, ""they learned all these from Pride and Prejudice already!"" Who are these people?

Second, it's that for such a supposedly devoted couple, Darcy and Elizabeth don't talk. AT ALL. And when they do, they only say the wrong things. I know that miscommunication is usually used as a plot device. But this is taking it to the extremes. Elizabeth even goes so far as saying that silence, I kid you not, ""was... a part of the allure of the union these two unlikely people had formed?"" Apparently to Elizabeth, their love ""grew daily and stronger"" by not saying anything.

Third, there were plot holes and unbelievable plot twists galore. The biggest of which is this whole ""Frenchwoman"" nonsense. Elizabeth is led to believe that Darcy fell in love with a French woman he met during the war three years before they met, had a child with this woman, and then the woman died. Like hello, how could he have a son being raised near his estate and no other person from the county or town or village would know? And Lizzy thinks that this is why he was so morose when they first met. Uh, woman, you know it's because of what happened to Georgiana. When would he have the time to bother with Georgiana's drama and his supposed French baby mama drama? Then right at the LAST chapter, it's revealed that Bingley was actually the one who got a French woman pregnant... And that's why Darcy didn't want Jane to marry Bingley. He was apparently looking out for JANE. And apparently none of Bingley's sisters knew because it was Caroline Bingley who taunted Elizabeth with the story.

Lastly, the ending. What the bleep happened? Every problem just got pushed under a rug, never to be seen again. Never mind the consequences of Elizabeth misjudging Darcy yet again, and her running away from Pemberley without so much as a goodbye. Nope, they have a reunion, a kid, and a painting. The end. I don't even know what happened to Georgiana, who as far as I know is now best friends with CAROLINE BINGLEY in London. Maybe a minuscule explanation was inserted somewhere but honestly, near the end, I just skimmed most things through.

As an added bonus, another complaint is that the author jumps POV in one chapter too much that I'm usually confused as to whose thoughts and opinions I'm actually reading.

What was most disappointing was that the author is apparently a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and the half sister of a descendant of Jane Austen's brother.

So yeah, sorry to be harsh, but I've just got a lot of angst for this book. Stay FAR away."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Sharon L,"November 21, 2013",1.0,"It is no secret I'm a big fan of Jane Austen, and though Pride and Prejudice is not my most favourite of her books it was still so good I did not want it to end.


I wanted more, I wished for more, I really wanted to know how would Eliza and Darcy interact as a married couple.

then, I heard this book was a continuation, that put a lot of research and tried to write according to the little stories that were exposed in Jane's letters to her sister.
some of the reviews I read (not here) claimed that she was able to copy Jane's writing style. so I gave it a chance and how dissapointed I was!

my only thing to say is stay back! do not read! one should never try to continue Jane's books..."

Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,ana darcy,"May 22, 2017",2.0,"It is not realistic the what Elizabeth and Darcy are behaving. It could happen to have a bit of Elizabeth's overthinking but Darcy is distant and decides to leave when there is a bit of misunderstanding.
Georgiana being so mean together with Caroline... Caroline and Lady Catherine ""besties"" against Elizabeth.
I can understand that variations and what ifs can change behaviours but this is supposed to be a sequel, so it can not change people's behaviour so much."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Christina,"August 23, 2007",1.0,"I really disliked this book. I had high hopes for it, but it just wasn't true to the spirit of Pride and Prejudice. I didn't feel like she had a good grasp of the characters, the events were too overblown, and the writing was repetitive and unoriginal. In other words, it was a big disappointment. I'll just stick with the original Jane Austen books from now on."

Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Rohase Piercy,"November 17, 2020",2.0,"Oh dear. I have to agree with other reviewers on here and say that I found this really disappointing. At some points I wondered whether the author had ever done more than skim through 'Pride and Prejudice' - there are so many glaring mistakes!

The narrative is supposed to be set one year, give or take, after Darcy and Elizabeth's marriage. They have yet to conceive a child, while Jane and Bingley have a one-year old daughter and another child on the way. So far so good, but Jane's little daughter Emily is depicted as running about the place and playing with dolls' houses, rather advanced behaviour for a one-year-old.... while Lydia and Wickham, whose marriage in P&P takes place only a matter of months before those of the elder Bennet girls, have had 'four children in the space of four years' !!! And to top it all, Charlotte Collins, whose expectation of a 'happy event' is referred to by Mr Bennet towards the end of P&P is only just now expecting her first child ... it's all badly out of kilter timewise.

When the entire Bennet family (minus Mr B, who seems to have died suddenly just three months after his eldest daughters' marriages) descend on Pemberly for Christmas they are joined by Lady Catherine de Bourgh, her daughter Anne (who speaks not a word, as in the original), and the Bingleys plus Charles' two sisters, Caroline Bingley and Mrs Hurst. They are also joined, at short notice, by Aunt and Uncle Gardiner, who are of course welcome guests, but they bring with them the Wickhams, whom Austen says Darcy could never receive at Pemberly, and who certainly wouldn't be allowed on the premises with Georgiana present. Ructions are bound to ensue, and indeed they do, though in such a sporadic and jerkily narrated narrative as to strain the bounds of credibility. None of the characters are given depth, not even poor Elizabeth whose shaky grip on the duties of a hostess, and indeed on her equally inhospitable and unaccountably absent husband, would have the 'real' Elizabeth Bennet shaking her head in disbelief.

Several entirely new characters are introduced, which is normal in a pastiche, but there should at least be some attempt to fit them seamlessly into the narrative of the original - here we are suddenly confronted with a Darcy/de Bourgh cousin, referred to throughout at 'Master Roper' (are we suddenly on the set of 'A Man For All Seasons'?) who is set to inherit Rosings by entail if the Darcys fail to produce an heir! Oh, and the dance at which Elizabeth first meets Darcy is transferred, in her memory, from the local assembly rooms to Netherfield, and Aunt and Uncle Gardiner seem never to have resided at Cheapside - that is 'another aunt', but not Aunt Philips, even though she seems to have been uprooted from Meryton and replanted in London ... enough already, I can't go on.

It's dire stuff as regards both plot and character development, and I've only given the second star because the dialogue at least has that genuine 18th century rhythm."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Sheila Majczan,"August 7, 2021",3.0,"This is one of those stories I read before I retired and began reviewing every book I read. I do want to reread all those stories which I did not review but as time has slipped by and I haven't done so, I just want to mark all those stories as ""read"" so I have a record of the true number of books in the JAFF sub-genre I have read. I am using the average rating at this time as I do not remember how I rated this story back when I read it. If I ever get around to rereading it I will look at my rating to make sure it is true to my opinion. It was purchased Nov. 24, 2006 so that is most likely when I read it."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Morgan,"January 7, 2022",1.0,"Disappointing. The portrayal of the characters was completely off. The story line did not seem to flow and did not live up to Jane Austen. Would not read again, would not put it on my bookshelf."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Elizabeth Hernandez,"June 3, 2008",2.0,"I liked this book (surprisingly enough). I wouldn't recommend it to P&P fans though. I really wanted to give it 2 1/2 stars rather than 3 because I can't decide if I like ""liked"" it or if it was just okay. I read it quickly, mostly because it became easier and easier to get through as the story progressed and also because I really wanted to get to my next book (it's a library book so there's a time limit ;)
The start is slow, I wanted to stop reading and move on after each of the first few chapters, but the story did get more interesting and develops a similar Pride vs. Prejudice scenario to the original book. It's no Jane Austen. Though I think Tennant tries too hard to write like her she does develop characters similar to the Elizabeth and Darcy of Austen, but often repetitive in their Austen-like vocabulary, like Tennant gave in to admitting she could never write anything as good as Austen so she had to ""borrow"" a little hear and there, and there, and there...I did, however, enjoy the interactions of Elizabeth and Darcy as a married couple, though they were infrequent as the story line doesn't give them much time together. I would recommend this book to someone looking for a vapid, sweet, overly sentimental, sometimes frustrating, but quick read (who isn't too close a personal friend to Austen's original characters)."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Mullgirl,"September 11, 2016",1.0,"Um, how about shockingly bad? For a start? Sigh. Three hours of my life I won’t get back; that’s for damn sure.

This horrid sequel to Pride and Prejudice can only claim to be the sequel if Elizabeth Bennet was destined to turn into the ridiculous, fluttering creature that is her mother. I never thought of her as a jump-to- conclusions kind of girl in the real story–over-eager to believe the worst in someone, if it suits her, sure. But insipid, guarded, able to hold her tongue when she shouldn’t. No. I kept waiting for her to shout out “My poor nerves!”

The entire story is inconsistent. The plot line moves along in fits and starts, magically advancing many days and significant events in the space of a page, while dawdling horribly several pages to represent the space of a few hours. There are a few additional characters that Ms. Tennant adds here, but that are all abysmal.

Ridiculous. That’s the sum. Don’t read it. Don’t buy it. And don’t borrow it from your library. Resist the temptation, no matter how much of a Pride and Prejudice geek you are. This can only grossly disappoint. The review snippets giving it a rave on Amazon must be for some other book. Oh, and don’t be deceived, Ms. Tennant published this story previously under the name: Pemberley: A sequel to Pride and Prejudice. Eschew them both!"
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Skylar Burris,"February 20, 2009",1.0,"At first, I thought the author’s style of writing somehow rigid, in that I had difficulty reading her words with ease; but in time, I grew used to the writing, and it flowed well enough to read. The plotline is unbelievable and not in keeping with the personalities of Austen's original characters.   Elizabeth is suddenly a figure utterly lacking in self-confidence, and Georgiana is intermittently pleasant and haughty, as though the author was not sure how to draw her. (In the original, I think she was only shy—any indication of her being proud was owing to rumor, not fact.) Darcy is something of a secretive, sullen jerk, though Tennant vaguely tries to give him motivations for his clandestine actions. 

I also have some technical quibbles with the work. Emma Tennant has Jane with a one year old child less than a year after the Darcys are married. Now, unless my math is rusty, this would mean she had conceived well before her own marriage, a highly unlikely possibility.
She has Lydia with four children ""under four""—which, a year after the marriage of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, seems a bit much, as she was married only a few months before Elizabeth. She makes Rowsley (rather than Lambton) the former home of Mrs. Gardiner."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Marsha,"April 27, 2014",3.0,"The tone and much of the dry humor of Austen’s original novel remain intact in this sequel. The characters are much as we remember them, so much so it’s as if they’ve been dipped in plaster and left to harden. Eliza shows little of the maturity we might have expected from her, allowing herself to be bullied by her nasty in-laws and all too easily inferring that her new husband has a bastard child from a former liaison.

No one she confides to seems to be able to point out how difficult it would be to keep such a kind of thing secret, especially for six years. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy was much desired as a prospective son-in-law by many women. He was handsome, rich and had a fine estate. Surely a scandal of such proportions would have leaked out prior to any marriage he had. The child wasn’t kept overseas but in a village near his home in Pemberley; wouldn’t somebody have noticed?

Perhaps I’m being too incisive about this kind of thing; this was before the age of camera surveillance, after all. But Eliza’s too quick belief, like Othello’s suspicions about his wife, are annoying to read.

Finally, while the rest of the novel had a more or less easy pace to it, the ending felt far too rushed as if the author were eager to tie up all loose ends and be done with it."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Julie,"May 7, 2009",1.0,"I finally tracked down which P&P sequel I read while I was in London. Thank goodness I only got it from the library, because it was GODAWFUL. Tennant took utterly ridiculous liberties with the characters and I found the entire plot completely unbelievable, especially the end!

The only positive bit about it was the portrayal of some of Elizabeth's difficulties in getting used to her role as headmistress of a house such as Pemberley - things like being unsure quite when to ""disappear"" with the ladies after dinner (while the men went off to smoke, etc.) and little rules of etiquette.

Thank goodness that the other ""sequel"" I picked up at a book sale is at least by a different author.
Other than that, this book was a total waste of my reading time and I actually TOSSED it away from me when I was done."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Leslie Hickman,"July 11, 2008",2.0,"I was a bit disappointed in that it made it as if Elizabeth & Darcy did not have communication with each other. But in the original they had NO problem of saying what was on their mond, especially Lizzie! So this character makes her like a milksop. It still was a quick read that made me think of a different time than now, but it needed help with its timing greatly. It was all off!! It aged some people much faster than that of others. If it was only Lizzie's first Christmas with Darcy than Lydia & Wickham could not have had 4 kids in a row yet. So bizarre and inconsistent."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Crystal,"May 7, 2009",1.0,"I'd forgotten I read this book until I saw a friend's review and had a flashback. I think I'd repressed the memory.

Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Rebecca,"February 5, 2020",1.0,"This book is NOT a continuation of P & P. The characters are cardboard cutouts and caricatures of the real, living, breathing people created by Jane Austen. Elizabeth Bennet has become a weak, tiresome, pathetic, blubbering wimp, who jumps to the completely unbelievable and unjustifiable conclusion that Darcy has an illegitimate son in the village from his liaison with his true love, an anonymous Frenchwoman who has died. So now she thinks she's in a Gothic novel, and she plans to run away and devote her life to taking care of orphans. Seriously. Oh, and it turns out, he's Bingley's son! So that's the real reason Darcy discouraged Bingley from marrying Jane: because Bingley was devastated by the loss of his big love, not because Darcy believed Jane indifferent to Bingley, as Jane Austen wrote. Too bad she didn't think of it! Funny, I don't remember Bingley in mourning. Darcy is a stick figure. The characters behave inconsistently, and none of them are comply with the future planned out for them in the last chapter of P & P. Maybe the author should have read it a little closer.

Even the chronology is all out of whack. We are told that it's been almost a year since Elizabeth and Darcy have wed. In P & P, Jane and Elizabeth married at the same time, but in this book, Jane has a toddler and is expecting another baby any day--apparently after less than a year of marriage. Lydia and Wickham have four children under the age of four, after less than 2 years of marriage. Triplets and a single? Despite Jane Austen firmly stating that Lydia and Wickham were never invited to Pemberley, they end up there, with Wickham dining across the table from Georgiana. I could go on and on, but these errors ruined the book for me.

I tried to think of something nice to say. It is well written, and it gave me the opportunity to remember why P & P is so beloved, and how much better in every way it is."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Russell Forden,"February 20, 2018",3.0,"I listened to this as an audio book, since I haven't been able to find a print copy. I believe it was first published and attributed to 'a lady' rather than Emma Tennant, who seemed to have put her hand up a little after that. The audio book was read by Anne Dover, who did a great job of presenting all the characters and narrating the story. She was especially good at the more 'snooty' women, like Lady Catherine de Bourg. As for the story, Tennant does a wonderful job with the comic characters like Mr Collins and Mrs Bennett, including a funny sub-plot involving Mrs Bennett trying to snag a rich old husband for herself after Mr Bennett dies. I have to say though, there's way too much Mrs Bennett here - she must be one of the most annoying characters in all literature. I felt Tennant's version of Elizabeth was a bit muted and uncertain about her role, when I thought she should be more confident. Especially sad is how cowed she gets around some of the more assertive characters from the first novel - especially Bingley's sisters and Catherine de Bourg. But I loved the development for Mary, who gets herself a husband in the form of the heir to Pemberley, the ridiculous Master Roper. The story revolves around Lizzie's apparent failure to get pregnant and her suspicions that Darcy might have fathered a son illegitimately before their marriage. It's fun, but I think there are better sequels out there."
Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued,Anna,"January 13, 2022",2.0,"I simply can’t write something about this book without spoiling the whole thing.. so. Beware of spoilers.

First: This is not Jane Austen, although if you believe that you are pretty stupid. Nothing can ever compare with her fabulous writing, but I think the author at least should get some points for trying..

Darcy and Elisabeth are married and they are about to spend Christmas with Mrs. Bennet, Lady Catherine DeBourgh AND Mr. Wickham... ?!! Among their guests. This CAN just end in total chaos AND be extremely funny at the same time. If you ignore the fact that Mr. Wickham is invited. I don’t believe that Mr. Darcy would ever want to share space with him again.

BUT. Soon everything just becomes too weird. Mr. Darcy and Eliza never really talk, She thinks she has to leave him because she believe he has someone else...??? A new never before mentioned cousin to Mr. Darcy shows up - one that could inherit Pemberly and leave them homeless!
Mrs. Bennet is a widow since Mr. Bennets death and soon she’s about to re-marry..

And what about poor Mr. Bingely that gets to have had a secret child before he married Jane??!

The book had some funny bits and scenes in it, but overall it was a bit too weird even for me. Stuff simply didn’t make any sense."
After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse,Izzy,"April 24, 2014",1.0,"Unfortunately if you didn't feel betrayed before 'Dead Ever After', the final book in the series, you will feel betrayed with this...thing.
It's not a narrative or a short story. It's just short bullet points of Charlaine Harris twisting the story by going by her rules and NOT the rules of the Sookieverse.

I'm being serious. There's sadness, bitterness, anger and jealousy everywhere you look in this book. The majority of characters have horrific deaths, go through divorces and generally have an unhappy, depressing life.
Also, there are continuity errors (these are mentioned in spoiler tag below). I don't know how she achieved that in such a small ""book"" but she did.

For instance,

These kind of mistakes are just appalling. Just goes to show that a) Harris is not a good planner or a good writer and b) Her continuity editor is not doing her work. The readers of this series know these characters. It's clear that Harris & Co do not know them at all.


I think CH thinks that the only characters that we should care about is Sookie. Sorry, but I don't care about Sookie any more -- she became such a bitch towards the end of the series. Because of this, CH only gives Sam and Sookie what could be considered a ""happy"" ending. What I mean by that, is that it's not completely happy. I adored early Sookie who was a lovely young woman but I detest the person that she became.
Oh, and Sookie and Co (Hunter and other little mites with telepathy) still hate their telepathy. How nice, right? They still think of it as a disability. This completely goes against everything the fantasy genre stands for. Sookie should have been proud to be telepathic; the whole point of the fantasy genre is that the protagonist is supposed to embrace their gift. Why Charlaine Harris believes that Sookie's telepathy is a ""disability"" is beyond me.

Charlaine Harris obviously enjoys creating all of these characters and then torturing them. It's like something out of a soap opera -- all of these characters fates are so crazy and so contrived (and happens to most of them) that you just can't believe them.
They make you so very depressed and you just think, ""What was the point?""

This should have been free on her blog, website or even at the back of Dead Ever After. I don't recommend reading it. Imagine your own ending for these characters. Trust me, your imagination is a lot better than Charlaine Harris'. Harris may have started this series but she gave up on it a long time ago. It's clear that she dislikes romance, vampires, paranormal romance fans, happy endings and continuity.
Trust me, the average reader can run circles around Charlaine Harris and create a much better story."
After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse,Anne,"July 16, 2015",1.0,"Charlaine Harris should give classes on how to bitch-slap fans.
Really!
It's like she looked at all of those one star reviews for that last turd in the Sookie series, and said to herself:
Ha! Those sorry fuckers wanna know what happened NEXT?
Muhahahahahaha!
I'll show 'em what happens next...
And then she the most laughable thing ever, and giggled all the way to the bank.
See, if she were really trying to soothe all of the ruffled feathers, she would have offered this up as a FREEBIE on her website.
After all, it's a novella.
Nope. It's an A-Z list of characters, and what happened to them.
Most got a few sentences. Some got one line. And the ones got a page.

Some neighbor? A bar patron? A cop? Somebody randomly mentioned 10 books ago?

Sorry, but there's no way I'd ever invest my time in another one of her series.

Because I know she can write...when she wants to.
And I might really that series. But what happens when she gets sick of writing about those characters?
Yeah. No thanks, Lady.
This was nothing more than revenge on everyone who called her out for not giving these characters the send-off they deserved.
It's an overpriced (Kindle version is $5.50) ...not a book. And to say this thing was is an insult to illustrated books.
Drawing a picture around a letter of the alphabet is my idea of an 'illustrated' novel.

If you're thinking of starting this series?"
After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse,Kevin Richey,"November 6, 2013",1.0,"There are three things horribly wrong with this ""book,"" and the first is that it exists at all.

The Sookie Stackhouse series (inspiration for the HBO series True Blood) has had 13 novels, close to 20 short stories, and a companion guide already. The last book, released in May, closed the series. It wrapped everything up, even if those conclusions were mostly disappointing to fans. This book has now been released as a ""coda"" to the series, so that author Charlaine Harris can give fans the answers to what happens to everyone in the series, both major and minor, It's not an epilogue; there's no story here. This is simply what Harris thinks happens to the plumber from Book 4, or the lawyer's children who you never actually meet in the series, to Sookie and Jason, and so on—up until the day that they die. This is my first real complaint: readers aren't really supposed to get this kind of thing spelled out for them. After the book ends, what happens to everyone should largely be left in the reader's imagination. Still, as this was from the original author of the series, I tried to go in with an open mind.



Geez, these people had boring lives. For some characters, all that is mentioned is that they died decades later. If the most interesting thing that happens to a person in their life is that they died falling off the toilet, that person doesn't deserve a book. Fiction is about excitement, the essence of life—not summarizing how many kids someone had, or reading like an obituary. Really, that's how this entire book felt: like reading the obituary of every single character, no matter how minor. This was both dull and depressing. Plus it's lazy, amateur writing throughout. Really sloppy. What's worse though is that she selects a few random characters and DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. This is obviously because she plans to write more about them, or wants to keep that option open for herself even if she may never get around to it. One of the characters this happens to is Quinn, who was a pretty major character in the series. We find out NOTHING about him. This is his entry:

That's it!



I think I read this in twenty minutes, and I tried to read slow to savor it. It is over 200 pages long. Out of curiosity, I actually counted the words on a random section (Letters P-Q), and it was somewhere around 350 words in roughly 20 pages of book. That makes it around 17.5 words per page. Average wordcount for fiction is 300 words per page. This means that if After Dead were formatted properly, it would be ELEVEN PAGES. Let me repeat that: That is not an exaggeration or hyperbole. That is math.

The brevity of some of the entries is offensive. Some characters literally had two words written about them, and this takes up sometimes five pages, between the blank pages, and the ""art"" included. (There are graphics throughout of big letters to divide the book into alphabetical sections. I think there are more pages of these than pages of text.) I had luckily seen the negative Amazon reviews about this, and got my copy from the library. If I had paid the $18 asking price (I think you can get it for around $10 on Amazon, print or ebook), I would have been seriously pissed. This should have never gotten its own release; it's just too short. If Harris wanted to deliver this information, she could have put it up for free on her website, or added it to the Sookie Stackhouse Companion, which is in dire need of an update. That would have been more appropriate than telling fans she wrote a ""coda"" to the series, when all she did was write a few disjointed, lazy thoughts about characters' fates, most of whom nobody remembers."

Please step away from your computer or put way whatever you use to pen your Sookie Stackhouse series.

My suggestion is to let your former fans take over and try to resuscitate this mess in the world of fan fiction. What happened to you? Did you loose your inspiration for Eric? For Sookie? If you needed help all you had to do was listen to the fans. By the way, what the hell were you thinking when you released this new shit. Was this your attempt to say ""suck it"" to the ppl who sent you hate mail for DEA? Please just stop writing and go enjoy your millions I contributed to....no more Sookie releases please, we can't take this anymore, just step away, SERIOUSLY!!

I gotta hold of a copy and it is a complete waste of time!! Half the ppl mentioned you don't even remember cause they were so insignificant and irrelevant to any of the stories.

After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse,Marie,"December 4, 2013",1.0,"Oh dear, that was actually worse than I expected! Alright, first off: Don't buy this book. If you're like me, and you have some deep seated need to torment yourself, get it from the library.

The list price on the back of this baby is 18 bucks. Let me give you a quick mental image of what you're paying 18 bucks for. While the book is hard backed, it's the length and width of your typical paper back book, and has 208 pages, which doesn't sound that skimpy until you look at the pages. Most pages have only a single sentence, or if you're super lucky a whole dang paragraph! (wow). And of course, the backs of the pages are blank. As well, there are a ton of entirely blank pages as well as pages with ""artwork"" letters. So really, if you're paying list price you are seriously over paying.

Of course, I'll just take a wild jump and say that you can probably find this book cheaper than the list price, but even then I wouldn't say it was worth it.

These characters that we're ""catching up on""? Yeah, most of them you probably won't even remember. To be honest, less than half of the characters where ones I recognized.

And to be honest [spoilers] the majority of the endings were rather depressing. [/spoilers]

Also, perhaps the worst news of all... I'm pretty sure Charlaine Harris is planning a sequel series with Barry the bellman which is probably my worst nightmare. Let it die, please. Start a new series, unrelated to this massive crash and burn of a series."

First off, nearly 10 bucks for 200 pages. Ok. But then when you start reading, it's kinda like those little blurbs that they put during the end credits of a movie. ""so and so was voted most likely to succeed. He knocked up the head cheerleader, and worked at the local dump"". etc. Some of these ""pages"" only have two-three sentences! So way overpriced!

And that is pretty much it. There were lots more people talked about, but I only posted about the ones I really remembered fairly well, and that upset me. Too much sadness and misery, really. I find this book to be a rip off, TOTALLY not worth the price being charged. Every bit of this could have been contained in the paperback of the last book. It would be more incentive for people to buy the paperback, and people wouldn't be gouged by this blatant RIP OFF. As my friends know, I was one of the few people who didn't go into a rage at the last book, I understood how Sookie ended up who she ended up with.

After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse,Jennifer,"January 10, 2014",1.0,"This isn't really another book in the series. It is more like an appendix with all the characters in the Sookie novels listed alphabetically. It very briefly summarizes the fate of each for those who are curious. To give an idea of how brief the coverage actually is, it took me about 30 minutes to finish reading. The majority of the book is filled with blank space and illustrations. The only characters that got more than one page worth of summary were Sookie and Eric.

I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. You can look up the main characters if you are interested, but I found the explanations to be less than satisfying and predictable. There were no major changes or surprises. The blurbs for most characters are a couple sentences, and a lot of the characters are so minor that I forgot who they were and don't care how they fared.

✦ I love the rosebush mail between Niall and Sookie.

✦ Bubba!! I wish something better had happened for him but the whole Nashville thing was a bit funny.

✦ Desmond Cataliades ~ he really grew on me and I liked how he kept in touch.

✦ Bill ~ well that wasn't a surprise.

✦ A little surprise about JB Du Rone, Tara's husband, and a lot of disappointment.

✦ I like how things worked out for Alcide.

✦ Hunter ~ no surprise there.

✦ Eric!! a half hour - really? that's it?? Come on...why not make it a dream or something? would be easier to take.

✦ Quinn - another one that wasn't a surprise.

After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse,Branwen Sedai *of the Brown Ajah*,"November 3, 2013",1.0,"So I was actually MARGINALLY happy to see that this book was being released. Mostly because I felt that the ending to the last book in the series was pretty disappointing and was hoping to find some resolution.

Boy, was I wrong.

Luckily for me, I decided to skim through this in the bookstore before just buying it, which is what I usually do.

Thank god for that.

This isn't even a book. I don't now how it could be considered so, being that it is a series of little blurby sentences, sometimes paragraphs on the eventual fates of the characters from this series.

So instead of buying it I decided to sit in once of the comfy Barnes & Nobles chairs and read it right there. It took me a whole ten minutes. No lie. And all it was, to be completely honest, was a complete and utter crapfest on this series. Many of the characters don't get happy endings. Many of them go through divorces, or die, or have other awful things happen to them. And much of it just didn't make any sense at all. I know that sort of makes it realistic and I understand that real life is no walk in the park, but this book takes it to a level of sadness that I can't even convey. And then the worst part? She basically confirms that Bill and Eric pine for Sookie for the rest of eternity and are miserable.

Seriously, Charlaine Harris? Are you kidding me?

I understand wanting characters to suffer so they grow and change but you've got to be kidding me. That sort of thing is usually done for a noble reason and this was done for no reason at all.

When I got done reading it all I felt was dismay and more disappointment.

I wish I could unread it.

I strongly STRONGLY suggest that you DO NOT read this so called book if you are a fan of the book series. Because it is an awful representation of it. And that's why I am so devastated by this, I think. I truly love the Sookie Stackhouse series, have read and loved every one. And this last piece of crap is nothing short of a travesty.

It upset me so badly that I don't even want to do a blog entry for this review. :/

Don't waste your time or money on this, my book friends."
After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse,Maggie Gordon,"November 1, 2013",2.0,"After Dead was a very strange and unfulfilling follow up to the Sookie Stackhouse universe. Harris writes short (often only a sentence or two long) notes on what happened to the different characters after book 13. However, many of the included characters are minor, forgettable people that readers probably don’t really care about, and several of the more popular characters suffered through very unfortunate lives. Not to suggest that events like heart attacks or divorces don’t happen, but for readers, it is really unpleasant to have your last look at a series be tainted by unhappy events that did not have the benefit of build-up or denouement.

I finished After Dead without feeling as if it had added positively to my experience of the series. If Harris was going to write something like this, I would have preferred to see longer stories about the main characters with more than just tiny hints about significant events in their lives.

I also expect that Harris may be teasing readers with future possible stories (involving Barry, Quinn, other people listed as having adventures that were unspecified), and this was annoying. After all, if we never get these stories, then some of the more interesting characters were left unexplored.

In any case, this is a book for only the most diehard of fans. It’s very short, takes under a half hour to read, and is oddly melancholy."
After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse,Skye,"November 6, 2015",,"Charlaine said that she wasn't writing another Sookie NOVEL. This is an addendum. Kind of like an extra-long epilogue.

There have been characters upon characters in the Sookie Stachouse series.
And there have been suitors upon suitors, one after the other. Many of us have been rooting for different men (I have not been team Eric all the time…I confess), and nobody was wrong per se. I think that some must have wanted Sam and Sookie together as well, but real build up was missing. And a genuine spark. Of all the relationships, this one was most vague, stretched thin and frankly? Boring. And yet - here we are. In the bleak future.

’’Trust me,’’ Charlaine Harris whispered to her fans. And we trusted, and we plowed on, trough 13 books, and more than ten years.


And now? I am numb. I am disappointed. I am near tears. The horrible futures. The unfulfilled lives. The utter pointlessness of this book. The agony that continues.


As I said, I was a Eric sympathizer. I, like many other, saw the redeeming qualities, the love behind the façade. Not just for Sookie, but for his children, his little corner of the world, hell, even his bar. We, the fans, rode the ups and downs of this rollercoaster, and we watch it all change – Sookie in to somebody different, Pam in to something ungracious and bland…Alcide, Eric, Bill, Tara…people upon people. And with people, foundations. Vampire marriage vows, decrees, personalities upon personalities sacrificed in the name of…what? Who?

After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse,Cstillsquare,"February 19, 2013",3.0,"For series die-hards only, the coda is a set of brief blurbs about the fate of major and minor characters, A through Z. It's an enjoyable punctuation to the end of the series, with lots of sad, delightful, and sublimely mundane post-scripts to the characters of the SVM universe.

If you don't ""get"" the ending to Dead Ever After, there's no insight or redemption for you here. But if you enjoyed how the series played out and Eric and Sookie's fraught relationship, their coda entries are very bittersweet.

Worst entry--Quinn. Because it's so open to his reappearance. And I can't stand Quinn. It would have cracked me up if his entry had been the one that simply said ""contracted gonorrhea.""

Best entry--Bill. CH is somehow both being faithful to the character's development and Sookie's HEA but TOTALLY TROLLING. It was evil and fantastic and I love it.

Originally, Ms. Harris considered posting this Coda to the SVM on her website as a freebie for her fans. I probably still wouldn't have enjoyed much of it - Jason's dumb telepathic daughter, JB the cheater, and Eric enjoying servitude while Bill the rapist buys a kingdom somehow aren't that appealing.

This was barely a book, it was ridiculously short and it read worse than fan fiction. Why wasn't it just added to end of the last book? Why release a separate 'book' months later? Harris could have just put the content of After Dead on her website. Ugh, this was such a waste of money.
I didn't even remember most of the characters mentioned, why write about such insignificant characters? I wasn't interested in them at all.
I suppose it was sort of nice knowing what happened to the main characters. It was all so cheesy though… Most of the characters got married, had kids, and lived boring lives. Whilst a few more evul characters had more crappier lives. Yea, I really didn't need to know about how many kids so and so had, and what their kid did for a living, and who their kids married — what do I care about kids I've never even heard of before?! I would have preferred to know more details about what happened to the characters that were actually in the series rather than reading about their random bloody kids! Ugh."

I really didn't care about 3/4ths of the people mentioned here and barely remembered them, if at all.

This would have been a lot better if Harris had instead written short stories regarding some of our more favourite characters (Pam, Jason, Eric for instance) instead of short throwaway paragraphs to sum up the rest of their lives.

Perhaps some things would have been better left to the fans' imaginations."

WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT THAT PRICING AN ALMOST EMPTY BOOK 9€ WAS A GOOD THING. for real. if you combine the 195 pages and take out the artwork and the blank space it's probably like 50 pages long.
cons: pretty much what i said, Lafayette *he has nothing to do with this. i'm still bitter & i'm blaming it on this abomination*, i read it in like 30minutes + the fact that she DOESN'T EVEN TELL US WHAT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE (ex. ... wooooowwww he does stuff. you don't say). if i keep thinking about it i will somehow find more shit to complain so i'm leaving it here.

Charlaine Harris has the nerve to charge readers full price for a book, and doesn't even deliver a full story, or sufficient details about her characters. Some are lucky to get a full paragraph, but most consist of a few lines. Not only that, a majority of the characters were minor characters who people had forgotten even existed, but we all wanted to know what happened to the milk-man, right...right?!?!?! People have complained about the book having numerous blank pages and disappointing outcomes, and still you're charged full price. Something of this quality should have been free or dramatically reduced!

However, Ms. Harris had contractual obligations to produce a 14th book, the only problem, she didn't have a 14th book to write. Once again Charlaine Harris shows how she is a piss poor writer. I'm just glad I stopped reading this abysmal series at book 10, though I wished I'd stopped at book 1."

Hopefully this execrable dross has reached an end with this cynical grab for her fans’ last remaining dollars.

This isn’t actually a novel, rather a pathetically short (just over 7000 words) A-Z explaining the fate of every single character from the Southern Vampire Mysteries series. Most of the characters I either don’t remember or barely recall, such was their impact on the story. Some get a single line, some a page. The tone varies widely, from the single line fate of unmemorable extra Hank Clearwater: , to the details of Terry and Jimmie Bellefleur’s untimely deaths in a road accident or of Andy Bellefleur’s teenage daughter due a heart defect. Not sure what the Bellefleurs have done to upset Harris so much. Then there’s the demise of town drunk Jane Bodehouse: After 13 books of her being an befuddled figure of mockery whom nobody cares less about she eventually dies in a drunken accident, which I assume Harris’ considers her just desserts. It seems a touch mean-spirited, to say the least. In fact, the “book” generally reads like a list of causes-of-death: Sundry characters, some of whom we last saw as children, are shot, drowned, suffer strokes, die in bar fights or from tragic accidental overdoses or breast cancer, expire mid-coitus, perish in a “freak construction accident” or a motorbike crash, or are crushed by a tree-branch whilst they sleep. One character I don’t recall is blown up by terrorists, one is afflicted by lupus as a punishment for her earlier transgressions and dies unmourned, and another dies in slow pain from a combination of arthritis and pneumonia, but his wife remarries happily, so that’s alright. Another unfortunate is killed by a werepanther and , even though shifters are out of the closet now and authorities were previously able to recognise one in a half-changed state less than 24 hours after they made themselves aware to the public."

After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse,UltraMeital,"July 2, 2015",1.0,"This is the last book on the Southern Vampire Series, best known as ""Sookie Stackhouse"".
I've read all books in the series, loved the first ones better than the last ones.
In my opinion, when the TV Show True Blood started Harris got alittle lost and started changing the characters in a way that matched the way the characters played in the show but meant that they stopped being true to themselves..
The last book was a colossal disappointment to readers (as it was for me) so I wasn't really waiting for this book but I knew I WILL read it nevertheless..
So what do we have in this ""book"" - a few words, sometimes 2-3 sentences per character, and since this series had 13 books a lot of the characters I wasn't even sure who they were or from which book.. So it would have been nice to have some sort of reminder..
Only Jason, Sookie, Eric and Bill got about a page of what happened to them next.
It felt lacking in every sense since it was dry, so dry.. especially after reading the dry details of the other characters.
I gave this book half a star and even that is WAY too much.
I didn't buy it, and won't recommend that anyone pay 10$ for this ""book"" - it's not worth it even if you are a ""collector"".
You can read this ""book"" in about half an hour of boredom.
I'm not sorry I read this one, I feel sorry I read this series with such enthusiasm and in the end got the middle finger from the author.
I'll still be a great admirer of Eric Northman. but from a distance. I won't re-read the books, won't really recommend them unless that person knows that this is a ""no-end"" series since there is no reason to read about half of the books.
The first 4 books were great! next 3 books good but not as good but from 8 till 13 - just disappointment after disappointment.
In my eyes the TV Series is a disappointment as well. Sookie isn't who she is in the books, and Eric is sexy as hell! but isn't true to who he is in the books either. I always saw Eric as smart, canning and playful but never being mean for the sake of being mean (I have a lot of other complaints but I'll leave you with just this one..). I miss the way he was in the beginning.. I also feel that everything that happened with Bill was a total waste of time. didn't get it. He's a pathetic businessman that's it..
and what do I think of Sookie? There is no reason for everything that happened in 13 books if all she wants is a boring life with a boring man. and this is what we got - a boring ending and a even more boring ending to the series.
a DON""T READ unless you really want to disappoint yourself even more from the series.
I'm not spoilering anything since 1 minute after finishing I forgot almost everything I read."

Consider this not a review, but more of a public service announcement. Whatever you do – DO. NOT. SPEND. ONE. PENNY. ON. THIS. PIECE. OF. GARBAGE. If you’ve been married to this series since its inception as I have, you will find yourself tempted. I encourage all to not even waste your time reading it. It is truly that – a waste of time. This book has zero new info – just follow-up blips “Where Are They Now” style of everyone ever associated with Bon Temps. The only new info (and I’m not even going to spoiler this, so cover your eyes if you don’t want to know) – is that Harris says we might hear more from Barry the Fucking Bellboy (GAH!!!!), which basically means, much like a vampire, this series will NEVER DIE UNLESS WE STAB IT IN THE HEART. Or , to take a more realistic approach, stab Harris in the pocketbook and not spend any more hard earned money on this crap.

To everyone involved who won’t just let Sookie fade into the woodwork, I have one thing to say:"

No, I haven't read or purchased this particular book, nor will I ever touch it. OJ Simpson is right where he belongs - in jail. Which is, honestly, too nice a place for this vicious killer.

Inspired by my reading of ""Brentwood Notebook"" in Douglas Coupland's Polaroids from the Dead I decided to finally read this book which had been resting on the house's bookshelves for at least the last ten years.

Now, I'm of two minds about O.J. and his involvement in the crime, the murders of Nicole and Ron. Sure, he could've done it. He was jealous and trying to rebuild a life with the mother of his children and, lo and behold, she's getting rides home from this gigolo waiter. He snapped. Well, he planned and snapped. We often forget that O.J. had had some SEAL knife-swinging training due to his involvement in a never-aired TV pilot about frog-men. Or, it could've been the work of a different jealous lover of Nicole's. Or a husband whom had (also?) been cuckolded by Ron. Or it was somewhere in between: a maniac fan of O.J.'s could've decided to release his hero from the bonds of cuckoldry, O.J. could've half-heartedly hired hit-men to keep the status quo, a nearby neighbor infatuated with Nicole could've done it. Mob payback for gambling debts. Time-traveling Jack the Ripper. Point is, we don't know.

This book was written for two reasons: to answer some letters that had flooded in after the arrest and to raise money for the defense. There were two raggedy pigeons flapping here, and why not? Why not one 199-page stone to take care of things?"

"I Want to Tell You: My Response to Your Letters, Your Messages, Your Questions",Cheryl Durham,"July 30, 2019",2.0,"First, let me say that I didn't purchase this book to find out the particulars about the strategy for his legal defense. Like millions of Americans I watched the Bronco chase on the freeway. For the life of me I'm still trying to figure out...why...but nowhere else but Tinseltown.

I purchased the book for several reasons. Namely, I watched the The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story. Parts of it captivated me; other parts, I believe, could have been edited. The parts that captivated me left me wanting other answers. Secondly, I was hoping to read about the true friendship he had with Robert Kardashian and I wanted to learn more about the manner in which Lawrence Schiller would present OJ. Each above listed person had a long and personal relationship with him.

The book spent little time looking at the legal teams battling to convict or acquit the football legend of double homicide. That wasn't the essence of the writing. The essence behind the writing was to respond to the many letters that had been written to O J while incarcerated in LA.

I enjoyed the writing style of Mr. Schiller. The writer didn't appear to be slanted or jaded. I particularly loved reading about the feeling that consumed him upon entering the jail. The writer really painted the picture without being really derogatory. I think, without a doubt, it was very difficult for the writer to remain poised. It was also during those times when he felt for the confined.....felt for his friend.

I did not find out much about the relationship with Robert Kardasian. I did find out more about his beloved mother. Ironically, as the story was told...the many checks he sent her had not been cashed. Reportedly she rested on the fact that many athletes had gone broke and she figured he'd need it. That was very foretelling...because he would need it. I also enjoyed reading about the visits from Rosie Grier (who has had his tragedies but has a newfound faith in God and his promises).

I was amazed, for reasons that I will keep to myself, about him bringing up racism. That's a card he could have kept to himself. Up to this point, his dating, lifestyle and living, had afforded him to be an African American of ""privilege."" I still recall the Hertz rental commercial. I recall the play with the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers and the induction into the NFL Hall of Fame. I remember the opportunity given to him as an announcer and the many benefits his talents had afforded him and his loved ones. Do I think there were never episodes of racism? No, I am not that naive. I just think that to reflect at this time....was a shot below the belt. I think he was reminded.....that the same system that elevates you...can also bring you back to reality.

Whether the chaotic mini series, LAPD investigation, questionable jury decision or his take.....the jury spoke...reasonable doubt. I'm still lost on the reasons for the writing. It was a quick and easy ready. If for no other reason...it gave a glimpse into others in his personal life. Also, it revealed that if people on death row can get letters of support....why not him...."
"I Want to Tell You: My Response to Your Letters, Your Messages, Your Questions",David,"February 27, 2016",2.0,"I recently read If I Did It, O.J.'s ""hypothetical pseudo-confession"" (check my page for that review), and was stunned when I came across this book in the return bin at work. I couldn't believe that, after all the hype and outrage that surrounded the release of If I Did It, I'd never heard of the book O.J. ""wrote"" (through 22 hours of interviews with a ghostwriter) during the trial. So, I picked it up and read it over the course of an evening.

While I was hesitant to put a numerical review on If I Did It (again, see that review for why), I don't have any issues rating this low. It's not that it's poorly written or purposefully deceptive (after all, whether guilty or not, O.J. has always maintained his innocence, so seeing that here isn't really a surprise, nor would I say it's distorting facts any more than what you'd expect if you believe he's guilty). The problem I have with this book is how choked it is with sycophantic letters. The only really negative letters included are of the blatantly racist variety, censored of expletives. For a book that purports, according to the subtitle, to be O.J.'s ""response to your letters, your messages, your questions"" it lacks any real answers (If I Did It gives what I take to be a much more accurate depiction of his life with Nicole).

What makes I Want to Tell You interesting, and boosts it that extra star from being completely worthless, is the comparison of how he describes his relationship with Nicole, compared to the other book almost two decades later. Here, they lived in bliss, full of love for each other. There's none of the accusations of her mistreatment or neglect of the children, none of the depictions of her as an unstable, coked-out near-psychotic that practically drove him to kill her. In fact, he goes out of his way to describe how great a mother she was. In the entire book, he takes a single jab at her, saying ""she blamed other people for her problems when she was unhappy"" (pg 25).

Like If I Did It, I can't recommend anyone purchase this book. It's not worth it. I can't even recommend anyone read this unless they're interested enough in the case to have already read If I Did It. Any lingering doubts you have about his ego or duplicity from reading the other book, this one will erase. It's impossible to read both and not see that, in one or the other, he's lying at some point. That alone makes it a worthwhile read for a single evening. Just don't waste money on it. Get it from your local library.

(And seriously, you've got to wonder about the mental health of some of these people sending positive letters to O.J. - not so much the kids, but definitely with the adults. In that way, it's kind of fascinating, like the groupies that sent love letters to Charles Manson or Ted Bundy.)"
"I Want to Tell You: My Response to Your Letters, Your Messages, Your Questions",Raindog308,"June 10, 2018",1.0,"This rating is strictly a rating on the book itself.

It truly is a 1-star book. First, it's incredibly fake. Lawrence Schiller admitted he made up many of the questions and wrote many of the answers. If you have seen the hand-written version of Simpson's suicide note (not the one cleaned up for the press), you'll know Simpson is ""semi-literate"" to quote Jeffrey Toobin. There's no way he wrote these answers.

Second, the questions Schiller made up are often preposterous. E.g., ""Everyone is focusing on the alleged abuse you inflicted on your ex-wife. No one has mentioned the abuse she inflicted on you."" Give us a break.

And finally, Schiller's answers are a boring recitations of sterile pieties. This book was a (successful) attempt to cash in the last remnant of Simpson's pre-trial fame and goodwill.

The only significant part of this book is in one of its final chapters Simpson says he's sure the truth about the murders ""lies somewhere in the world of Faye Resnick"". Schiller later said he threw that line in almost as an afterthought. But watch any Simpson interview and he'll quote it word-for-word."
"I Want to Tell You: My Response to Your Letters, Your Messages, Your Questions",Logan Gifford,"May 25, 2017",3.0,I bought this book for $1 at a local CVS Pharmacy. as a Las Vegas local I thought it would be interesting to take a look at the original trial that he faced although I was not alive when the verdict was reached. with an interest in law I wanted to learn about Nicole Brown's death as I toured the Clark County Detention Center. having been born in enough time to witness his last case at Palace Station I was interested to get his perspective on Nicole's death. the contents of the book came off as a bit fake. the letters themselves were very entertaining to read and get the nation's perspective on this case. I did not realize the historical significance of this book and the fact that it paid for Johnny Cochran. I am considering writing OJ as I am a history major and I want to fully understand his side of the case before he dies. interesting read nonetheless although I wish there was more two his commentary on the letters even though it was written mid-trial
"I Want to Tell You: My Response to Your Letters, Your Messages, Your Questions",Sarah Crowe,"August 3, 2016",2.0,"Now, I love a self-indulgent book full of obssessive fan letters to a formerly popular celebrity as much as the next gal [seriously, read ""Letters to John Glenn,"" omg, ""Letters to John Glenn"" which is all about actual letters to the astronaut John Glenn, is such a beautiful book. A 6-year-old wrote a prayer to him! I cannot even fathom that level of devotion]! But this book just doesn't do it for me.

First of all, if these are O.J.'s fans, then *yawn*, i'm better off without any. he goes on and on about the amount of fan mail he got and even talks about a spare jail cell full of his fan mail (which by the way, is that for real?!), yet the letters are soooo boring.

Considering that OJ was convicted of the murders, the book isn't worth a read except to get a sense of the character that he has. If you read it knowing he did it, it's basically a book by a sociopath in which you can quiz yourself on the ways he is manipulating the readers.

Quinn,Readingzmything,"April 16, 2016",1.0,"I'm not deleting my original written review. However I've reduced my stars to one. While I really liked this book, I'm disappointed in the way this author responded to an unfavorable review. Sadly, I won't be reading book 2.


My previous review:


Honestly, I can't think of one negative thing to say about this book although, there is a major cliffy, this author is famous for that, she redeems herself by releasing book 2 within a few weeks. This is addictive. The characters are so authentic and their connection and chemistry is palpable. There are some real steamy scenes that were well written. And then there is the lovable, loyal retired military dog, Kimber. I love that dog and her relationship with both Quinn and Lexi. They are truly the dynamic three! I can't wait for book 2!"
Quinn,Lana ❇✾DG Romance❇✾,"April 13, 2016",2.0,"2.5 Stars

Once again, I find myself to be the black sheep and not liking a book most of my friends did. Le sigh. I'm starting to think there may be something wrong with me here, but alas, it is what it is. I know I tend to be a picky reader, so before I get to my review, please understand that just because I felt this way about this book, doesn't mean you will. Some of the things that bother me, may not bother you, so I suggest you leave your judgement till you read the book.

There are a few things that are guaranteed to ruin my enjoyment of a book no matter what:
1. Purple prose/cheesy phrasing
2. TSTL heroines
3. Insta-anything
4. cliche situations

Unfortunately for me, this book covered all those bases. Sometimes if there's enough meat to the story I can overlook some of those things, but that wasn't the case for me here

So here we have Quinn; bad-ass alpha, former military that sometimes does things for the mafia and doesn't do commitment. Quinn gets sent on a mission to protect the daughter of a man he owes a favor to, so he unwillingly agrees to find and protect the pregnant mafia princess that's on the run and wanted for murder. Sounds interesting, right? I thought so too. Unfortunately badass Quinn thinks things like this...

Ok, Ok, this is only 33% into the story, I can handle it...

The said mafia princess is not quite what she seems. Unfortunately there's not much to her for me to even remotely connect to her. Here's a woman that's on the run for her life, she's on a run in the wilderness, forced to hike and camp; things she's never done before. Oh but guess what she doesn't forget to pack? Her vibrator.

Right.

But that's neither here nor there.

Now here comes this stranger, that helps you out because you don't know what you're doing and offers to protect you, and what do you do? Offer him your explicit trust, of course. I mean, why not, right? He seems nice enough and he has an adorable dog.

He also says things like this...


Silky sex? Who even says that? Men that want to pleasure said silky sex with their iron hard meat sword?

I really tried to love this book, truly. The set up sounded great and it had all the ingredients for a fantastic read. But between their almost instantaneous connection and the ridiculously cheesy dialogue at times, I found my interest quickly waning...


Milking you? Who even thinks that during a hand job? And what person internally refers to her anatomy as her ""sex""?


I can understand this if I was reading a contemporary romance. But let's be real, this is an erotic romance. There are plenty of times where both the c and p words are used. So why is the flowery variety needed then?

Between the cliche of bad guys arriving and announcing their entire plan, detail by detail, because they think no one is looking and the instantaneous connection between two people that should be the most mistrustful of anyone, I found myself starting to nitpick pretty bad.










All of this is completed with a cliffhanger that felt more like a chapter ending abruptly in the middle than anything else. Am I curious enough to continue with this story? I honestly don't know. I am but I'm not. I think I'll marinade on that decision for the time being.

There's so many that loved this book, and perhaps this was a case of wrong timing and me being overly picky, but be that is it may, sometimes a book works for you and sometimes it doesn't. I encourage you to read it and judge for yourself. Who knows? You just may end up loving it ;)

And I'll just be here..."

I couldn't connect to the Alexis at all she was immature and a doormat. And for God sake you are on the run and pregnant but you bring your vibrator with you. WTF!

And the hero was beyond annoying. I love jerks. I can cope with I'm God's gift to womenfolk attitude if done right. Even find it sexy. But here we have a twatty tosser who tries to make us believe he is funny but comes as degrading, abrasive and sexist.

Yet, remembering that everyone reads books differently and forms there own opinions.

If the reviews are mean or disrespectful then ignore it them, walk away and blacklist that blogger. You never have a temper tantrum in public, you NEVER tell your followers to flag the review.

Quinn,Dany,"April 16, 2016",2.0,"I didn't love this one but I also didn't hate it. This is my 1st book my this author and I'm not sure if I'm even reading book 2. Right now I don't care to know what happened at the end. I get what she the author was trying to do with the story but honestly it was lost on me.

You know going into this that Quinn is the hero of the story and well Lexi is our heroine and of course they're going to have an instant love/lust thing. But what I don't understand is the mafia background. Absolutely nothing read like this girls family was in the mob.

. And who the hell goes on the run to the damn woods? And let's not forget she made sure that her vibrator was packed. Yeah because on the run from you crazy ass ex is going to made you horny. I think not!!

The whole damn book they're in woods. When we get some action/suspense it feels like a let down. Quinn started off as a douche he really did. He does nice things for Lexi but it was also lost on me. The most likeable character is Kimber and that's a dog.

To be honest I laughed at the sex scenes. I just couldn't take him saying heat, silky sex or sex. Oh and how can I forget sliky folds. Oh lord I was so over that. Even my husband laughed when I read it to him.

I'm really not trying to be mean here but I just don't think this story was fully researched and put together well. I love military stories and most definitely mob ones also. I just didn't get that here. Is what I got was a over the top love/lust story. A weak storyline. And of course a cliffhanger."

So not my deal.
Everyone who has read might have a different opinion from me though. *shrugs*
1st POV be my go to choice of POV in a romance. Didn't work for me here.
I didn't the hero. I don't mind jerk heroes -- especially written with a sense of character. This book's hero was as deep as a puff of air. So disappointing.
I tend to jump over those grumpy types. Yum! ;P
mafia romances are also really cool when gritty. Sad, this didn't pan out for me. I jumped to the end (It's a big fat no all around)

But in light of what happened and GR taking down my, I'm going to review the 8% of the book I read.

So what made me quit this book? Quinn. Fucking Quinn and his slut-shaming and sexist remarks. For context purposes, Quinn bought home a gorgeous blond and had a ""sexathon"" with her. His words, not mine.



I wasn't bothered by this. I thought that hey, at least he didn't kick her out and was actually nice to her.

Apparently, I spoke to soon because right after he finished his business call, he then kicked her out even though he asked her to stay.



Okay. Not exactly the first time a hero did that but yeah...but Quinn didn't stop there. Some of his thoughts are like this:

Quinn,☆☽Erica☾☆,"August 10, 2016",,"This author's behavior is unacceptable. A lot of my GR friend's reviews were taken down because she reported the negative reviews, even though their reviews were honest and fair. Apparently she also contacted a reviewer and called her a bitch. Now, I understand authors feeling protective of their work and being defensive, but inhibiting others freedom of speech and trying to alter public opinion is against the main objective of this website. I was also shocked to discover this book's overall rating had risen almost an entire star since the last time I checked, which was approximately twenty minutes ago. Clearly there's something wrong here. To authors, if you are going to get ultra butthurt about negative reviews, why don't you just ? If you cannot handle dissenting opinion, you might not want to release your work into the world. Nobody is shoving our opinions down your throats.

That being said, I will not be reading this or anything by this author. Please respect reviewers and we will respect you.

Quinn,MzBond,"April 25, 2016",1.0,"Dear Goodreads and Thin Skinned Author,

This is a community of authors AND readers/reviewers. Not everyone is going to LOVE a book and they have every right to say it. Asking your fans to attack ""that bitch"" is not only childish on the part of a grown ass woman, it's classless, petty and sadly indicative of an extremely fragile ego.

Goodreads, I hope that these deletions are a bot and not some person who is not even aware of the full story, deleting reader reviews. If that's the case, you maybe need to adjust your algorithm and improve your process somewhat. Otherwise, What you're doing is censorship, and on you.

And since Goodreads has informed me I must review the book, and not the author behavior, here's my take. The male MC is the garden variety, arrogant, unlikable alpha-hole/misogynist. He's not even original, m'kay. Won't subject myself to utter rubbish conversations and inner monologues that look like this...

CG: Hey, I’m all rich and powerful and you’re just some little nobody. You should be flattered I’m even noticing you.

IM: ...again with the thanks?

CG: I have a bleep-ton of money, and I’m willing to share.

IM: I’m happy with my salary, sir.

CG: But you could be making waaaaay more money. AND you could be making me happy. I mean, what are you – uptight?

IM: Please take your hands off me, sir.

CG: Okay, enough beating around the bush.

IM: Gross, sir.

CG: I’m ready to give you a lot of money. And a house. And cool clothes – girls like clothes, right? And I’ll throw in a nice little settlement for your parents, too, while I’m at it.

IM: If you think my parents would take money from a cad, you don’t know them.

CG: Did you just call me a cad?

IM: I don’t know. Did I?

CG: Okay, that’s it. If you won’t accept my offer, I’ll just take what I want.

CG: Holding out for more money?

IM: Nope.

CG: I’ll kidnap you and stuff.

IM: Can’t help it. I’m just that virtuous.

CG: The way you say no is making me hotter for you every minute.

IM: Yes, sir. That’s called being male.

CG: I can’t live without you! Marry me!

IM: Sure!

CG: Seriously?

IM: Heck, yeah. I had a total crush on you all along. I knew deep deep deep deep down you had to be a really nice guy.

CG: Just so you know: After we’re married, I’m going to do that thing where I talk about how you’re so much better than I am, and then I’m going to prove how much I believe it by being the total boss of you.

IM: Now who’s making ME hot?

CG: Awesome.

Okay, so it’s not exactly a feminist classic.

Although in a weird way, it sort of is. If you squint.

Fact: was the first English-language novel whose heroine worked for a living. It still stands almost alone in being a fictional portrait of a servant who has dignity, intelligence, and strong morality.

Other fact: At the time was written, it actually needed pointing out that servants were fellow human beings, and that the honor of a maidservant was, on a cosmic scale, every bit as important as that of a lady. (Sadly, this still needs pointing out to plenty of people.)

I read this because I’m working on a fictional diary of an early 19th-century girl. She’s a reader, and was the of the time. There was merchandise and everything. So I to read this, because there’s no way wouldn’t have.

That said: This is not a romp. If you’re not doing research, I don’t recommend this as a pleasure read. Pamela’s earnest notes on how she can strive to be the perfect wife will make any modern reader squirm, and the way he treats her after they’re married is actually creepier than his previous relentless sexual harassment. I mean, at least back then everybody knew he was being a jerk. Now he’s supposedly a reformed rake. And he’s still – well, ew.

Glad I read it. Glad I’m done.

Now I’m going to find and , two short contemporary parodies that sound funny and have at least the virtue of being short."
Pamela,Charlotte,"January 29, 2009",1.0,"I did not finish this book. Because it is a million pages that boil down to:

PAMELA: I am a lowly maid. Yet my virtue, look at it.
MASTER-OF-THE-HOUSE: Ooh, dazzling. How 'bout you let me avail myself of some of that virtue?
PAMELA: No!
MASTER: YES.
PAMELA: No!
MASTER: YES.

[Insert cross-dressing in-bed-hiding country-house-involving shenanigans.:]

MASTER-OF-THE-HOUSE: Your virtue, it has won me over. Marry me?
PAMELA: But of course.

Ok, the shenanigans make it sound vaguely amusing? Just know that there are MANY MANY pages where Pamela details how awesome she is and the shenanigans are not nearly ripping or amusing enough to compensate for the remaining tedium.

Very popular in its day, though. Fathers bought it for their daughters. You could buy Pamela fans and tea-sets."
Pamela,Alex,"September 6, 2016",1.0,"When I read classics, it's not all about just reading them. I'm also trying to discover what's made them classics. I want to know why people like them so much. And I can usually figure something out; that's why I end up with so many five star reviews. But this? This piece of shit escapes me.

The first half is entertaining enough, as the vaguely-named Mr. B---- kidnaps a servant and tries to steal her titular virtue. There are dastardly schemes and narrow escapes. He dresses up like a woman in order to sneak into her bedroom and try to rape her. He makes a good villain, as does the vile Mrs. Jewkes, his accomplice.

Around halfway through, as plots and threats have failed to pierce Pamela's iron hymen, he changes his strategy: the carrot instead of the stick, so to speak. And Richardson has laid enough clues to make us suspect the wolf can't change his ways, so there's some suspense as we wait to see what new depths he's sunk to, and whether Pamela will escape with her virtue intact. (Not that the title leaves us much in doubt.) But then...

the bigger problem is how fucking it is.

Don't misunderstand me here: That's it, on and on, for hundreds of awful pages. There are parts of Atlas Shrugged that are better than the latter half of this book. It sucks so hard, man. I'm so sad that I read it.

Pamela was important in its time; its characterization and use of the epistolary was groundbreaking, and it influenced great authors like Jane Austen. But it was and is also super shitty, so you don't have to read it unless you're into the history of literature - which is different from being into literature. If you're not an academic, you don't need this in your life.

Do not read this book."
Pamela,Lynn,"January 3, 2013",4.0,"It saddens me that Goodreads has no love for this book. First of all, it's one of the earliest novels ever written, so it deserves more respect from that perspective alone. Secondly, you have to place it in its time. Early 18th century readers found this material quite titillating, and of course wanted to see a virtuous end to all the lasciviousness. That way, they could have their cake and eat it, too. For its time, this was really racy material. Naturally nowadays we find the idea of a woman who is nearly raped and yet falls in love with her rapist reprehensible, and rightly so. But you have to understand that back then, relationships were different. Once Mr. B, the antagonist, realizes that Pamela is determined to stay virtuous, his attitude towards her changes, which makes it permissible for her to fall in love with him.

I seriously think that Richardson wrote this novel with his tongue firmly in his cheek. It was published on an installment plan, which is why it seems to drag out for readers today. Think of it as the GAME OF THRONES of its time, if you will. There aren't as many differences between the two as you might think.

Oh, yes: it's an epistolary novel. Some readers might hate it for that reason alone. And the Version I read in College capitalized all the Nouns and important Modifers, because that's what Readers expected from the Author back then. Makes for some Ponderous reading today."
Pamela,Ahmad Sharabiani,"June 12, 2021",4.0,"Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded, Samuel Richardson

Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded is an epistolary novel first published in 1740 by English writer Samuel Richardson.

Considered one of the first true English novels, it serves as Richardson's version of conduct literature about marriage.

Pamela tells the story of a fifteen-year-old maidservant named Pamela Andrews, whose employer, Mr. B, a wealthy landowner, makes unwanted and inappropriate advances towards her after the death of his mother.

Pamela strives to reconcile her strong religious training with her desire for the approval of her employer in a series of letters and, later in the novel, journal entries all addressed to her impoverished parents.

After various unsuccessful attempts at seduction, a series of sexual assaults, and an extended period of kidnapping, the rakish Mr. B eventually reforms and makes Pamela a sincere proposal of marriage.

In the novel's second part Pamela marries Mr. B and tries to acclimatize to her new position in upper-class society. ...

Pamela,Jack,"July 28, 2011",1.0,A lower class woman eventually marries her upper class would-be-rapist. This novel somehow manages to be more misogynistic and offensive than the collected works of de Sade. It's also boring.
Pamela,Antonomasia,"January 18, 2020",4.0,"Maybe I'm from another planet (okay, now I've got the Julian Cope track in my head). Most readers and Eng Lit students can't stand Pamela, but I found much of it a page-turner. One morning, in an hour and a half, I read more of Pamela than I had read in a week from slogfest The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford.

As a kid I used to obsessively re-read a couple of books of saint stories; this foundation must be one reason that I found readable in Richardson what many find unutterably tedious. Pamela Andrews' personality, piety and ordeal is of a piece with any literal hagiography of martyrs. There are zillions of academic studies out there on Richardson, and unfortunately I haven't taken the time to search them comprehensively before writing this post - but there surely have to be some tracing a genealogy from Foxe's and the like. Unlike the Catholic martyrs I used to read about, (some of whom were also being imprisoned and pressured into marriage by wicked impious men, or, probably, sex but these were kids' books) Pamela's immediate reward isn't heaven and Jesus - nor the nice young vicar whom contemporary readers think would be a far more suitable and less risky husband for her - but a giant leap up the social and financial ladder in her post- wars of religion Protestant capitalist world. Her work ethic is rewarded. This absolutely doesn't mean I see her as a grifter and gold-digger along the lines of Henry Fielding's spoof . Nope, I totally believe Pamela, and the premise of the other book even makes me a bit cross. It's that 18th century England was a mercantile world where triumph meant material advancement and improved social status, not spirituality and self-denial of a sort idolised during the middle ages and sometimes the Reformation. The economy has changed significantly - but the social role of women has barely altered; on a symbolic level, a woman has the same old very limited choices of means to get ahead, even if some other aspects of society are different.

An odd point in the novel's favour, for me, was its repetitiveness. If most long books were this repetitive, it would take me less time and energy to read them. The repetition was also proportionally more interesting to me because of the age of the book: like , which I read a couple of months before, it showed the English novel at a rudimentary stage, and also what (at least some) people valued in the early- to-mid 18th century. For instance, it was more religious than the image of 18th century England in late 20th- early 21st century pop culture, all bawdy banter and big wigs. (However, 's bawdiness is not always immediately obvious; the novel was considered almost pornographic, not just for scenes like Mr B's invasion of Pamela's bedroom, but for things like the angle at which, in an earlier chapter, she fell on the floor. Something so subtle that, now, almost no-one would highlight it as erotic, bar the creators of online GIFs of - usually male - actors.)

As I've said before in a few reviews of classic novels, I love being able to get primary-source social history in such a readable format, and seeing how it was woven into people's lives. It sure beats 300- year-old newspapers. Though sometimes its presence is partly unspoken - instead knowing the history helps make sense of the story. It's in things like Pamela's quandary about escape. She isn't anxious for no reason, she has as much to fear outside Mr B's house as inside, with high crime rates, the prevalence of footpads and highwaymen, and the likelihood of hanging under if he were to accuse her of stealing if she fled. She can't be sure of finding safety anywhere. may be fiction, but the least realistic content is really the later part of the story. The first half or so is one of a tiny number of engaging primary texts I've ever encountered that show in detail what it was like being at the sharp end of pre-industrial aristocratic power, before there was any real hope of legal comeback against it. Most of what has survived was by people higher up the social scale than Pamela, or Samuel Richardson's family of origin. Contemporary readers often blast because the author was a man writing a woman who embodied and propagated clichés of her time - but the heroine is also a working-class protagonist written by an author from a working-class background. e.g. It is entirely plausible that Richardson heard among his family and friends women talking about hardening their hands for (domestic) work, and men too, as his father was a carpenter and Richardson himself a printer. One of the novel's main themes and arguments is that Pamela, a working-class young woman, has a moral worth equal to the upper classes -on the one hand, politically revolutionary thinking; on the other, obvious in Christian doctrine - and she stubbornly continues to insist on this despite great stress, threats, captivity, gaslighting and other trickery, and a near-absence of social support.

It is possible that I liked , and Pamela herself, as much as I did simply because I read the 1801 text, as found in the Penguin Classics edition. Readers of critical editions of classics will be familiar with the nerdy 'note on the text' about authorial revisions and different editions, rarely of real import to anyone outside academic literature study. seems to be one of the exceptions: there are dozens and dozens of revisions for the 1801 edition which can, when put together, substantially change Pamela's manners and motivations, and sometimes other characters' too. They make it a more coherent and genteel text. (For certain values of coherent and genteel which were already old by the time Jane Austen - known to have read Richardson - was writing.) They make look outrageous in its disbelief in Pamela, caricaturing her as a wily gold-digger (though I am writing this post #metoo, and perhaps I wouldn't have used as strong a word as 'outrageous' ten years ago). If I'd known about the extent of the differences I'd have got the more expensive Oxford World's Classics edition, which uses the original published text of . Its critical material is also more recent than Penguin's and the introduction is by Thomas Keymer, whose intros to (great) and (good but not great) I'd read earlier in 2019; I'd also thought I should go for a bit of variation and not read Keymer yet again. On the whole I thought Margaret Doody's intro to , dating from way back in 1980, had held up pretty well, and it was refreshing to see feminist topics discussed without hackneyed contemporary buzzwords, but with similar underlying meaning.

The psychology in the first half or so of the novel is compelling and observant, with numerous details about how Mr B gradually closes the net on Pamela, invading her mind and space, and about her increasing discomfort and alarm. I found it fascinating and convincing as a portrait of how a person with secure attachment, who is also deeply religious, might respond to this abuse. Pamela's relationship with her parents is fascinating as part of the history of childhood and the family. It seems to put the lie to ideas that all families of the past / this era were authoritarian. She may be fictional, but such relationships surely needed to exist to some extent then for it to be possible for Richardson to write one. Pamela's ongoing communications with her parents and their support of her as an autonomous being (in not insisting she must marry, even in a straitened situation where it seems the best way out) exemplify parents as a secure base. They are mostly excellent parents, apart from the one sad line where Mr. Andrews said he would have had to disown his daughter if she had become a courtesan (one suspects he actually might not have in practice), and the degree of their class-based deference to Mr B late in the novel is rather worrying. Would they try to be there for Pamela if she needed to leave him? (But the novel tries to exclude the possibility of that happening.)

I can see being a tough read for undergrads who have not long left, or worse, are still stuck living in, abusive homes. Not only is Mr B's terrorising of Pamela a deeply effective portrait of intrusive types of abuse (as opposed to neglect, or occasional random rages), but the reader also has to see alongside that how some young people have parents who are their closest confidantes, and who are a refuge for them (albeit constrained here by the limits of legal system against entrenched aristocratic power). And it's not just isolated scenes that may be disturbing: all this is continual over hundreds of pages; it's a long time for someone to spend on stuff like this if they are finding it stressful. I've never been wholly persuaded before about exemptions in classes for this sort of thing, and have a couple of -style stories of my own. But I can now easily imagine at my age if I were a tutor, letting some student skip if they were finding the early chapters too much for a reason like this. And if they are serious about scholarship, would suggest they try it again many years later when they've thoroughly processed everything. If you are not disturbed by it on a deep level, there can be a soapy, kind of compulsion to the narrative, with its (metaphorically) moustache-twirling villain and saintly young heroine. This is a book that belongs more with trashy yet addictive bestsellers than with high literature. (Incidentally, too many covers for Pamela, like this edition, make the mistake of not showing Mr B as young and attractive - his appearance is a powerful, but usually silent, element in Pamela's inner emotional drama.)

In the second half, the psychology can seem questionable. Pamela is adored and accepted by the local gentry. Shortly afterwards, I even found a real-life example showing the absurdity of this, in : in 1825 an elderly squire, Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh, married a young dairymaid. Mary Ann, the former dairymaid, and her younger sister - who took up residence with the household - were shunned by some nobility for the rest of their lives and had a limited social life. Pamela is unusually beautiful, pious and intelligent, but the steamrolling power of the class system is evident elsewhere in the novel (the powerlessness of anyone to stop Mr B abducting her; the Andrews' deference to him) so there's no real reason to think it wouldn't have also had some effect here, regardless of her personal qualities.

At first, I couldn't quite fathom why the book went on for so long after the wedding. But how sceptical were 18th century readers that someone like Mr B would change? Even if they did also accept the developing conventions of romance fiction. Were these extra chapters about showing that he did? Something I read (unfortunately I can't now track it down) suggested that the narrative doesn't leave Pamela before she is financially provided for, and legally agreed to have a degree of independence. Any contemporary reader with a modicum of knowledge about abusive relationships will be sceptical that Mr B would change so quickly. Even the 'reformed' Mr B is by 21st century standards, controlling, much of it in ways that seem characteristic of his time; however his requests to read Pamela's private letters, a continuation of the surveillance he previously put her under, are deeply unpleasant, and some 18th century ladies would have resisted this. I am fascinated by the impossible intersection of history and psychology (one can't go back hundreds of years to research and interview people to see how they would fit contemporary paradigms or perhaps need different ones) and wonder if there is anything in the idea that because Mr B's most abusive behaviour towards Pamela was more normal and more socially sanctioned, it is possible he was less psychologically disturbed in an underlying sense than someone behaving in the same criminal way in modern Britain - and because of that, it would be somewhat easier for him to change than one would expect from the contemporary person. Other ways of living and behaving, based on Christian piety, were highly visible in his time and provided a ready model to follow. One plus to the later chapters was the character's, and therefore Richardson's, surprising proto-psychotherapeutic attention to the way Mr B's and his sister's behaviour had been shaped by their childhood, and the implication that he needed to unlearn this to change - just as Pamela continually ascribes her own morality and strength of character to her parents. However, I also can't forget one of my all time favourite books, Anne Brontë's (1848) which is, in part, a counterblast to over a hundred years of post- popular romantic fiction suggesting that if a good young woman marries a rake he will change.

Entirely unexpected amid the novel's psychological intensity was the hilarious (to me) farce in a couple of late chapters when Mr B's furious sister comes to stay. The long scene between her and Pamela exemplified the sort of barbed banter associated with recent popular ideas of the 18th century (e.g. in Sally Potter's film of ) and gave Pamela as a character a delightful new dimension, as she comes out with lines like (to the sister's foppish nephew) Perhaps one should take more seriously the later scenes between the sister and Mr B, but for me her futile obstreperousness brought to mind Basil Fawlty.

I'm not going to recommend , as it's abundantly clear that most contemporary readers dislike the book and/or find it outright objectionable. However, there are a few of us, maybe often those who were or are the students whom tutors asked if they'd thought about postgrad, who find it interesting, even enjoyable in a way. The widespread dislike of the book can bolster this, encouraging readers to approach it with low expectations; with low expectations, one may sometimes be pleasantly surprised. (For certain values of pleasantly.)

Pamela,Paul Perry,"August 10, 2015",1.0,"I encountered Samuel Richardson's Pamela many years ago as part of my History of the Novel module at university. I was introduced to some great works through that course, and there are two reasons I am grateful for being introduced to this; mostly, because it was the first year the class had read Pamela rather than Clarissa (which is more than twice the length), but also because it made it clear to us that even in an academic environment there are books which are considered as classics because of their place in history that it is perfectly acceptable to hate. And almost the whole class really, really hated this book.

Most of the defence of this book is that 'morals and social mores were different then', which is undoubtedly true, but for me misses the point entirely as well as being poor reasoning. Richardson was writing with the explicit intent of creating moral instruction manuals - and tracts rarely make good literature. Pamela, an attractive servant girl, is kidnapped by the dastardly squire and spends five hundred pages defending her honour, until - shock, horror! - the dastard is won over and offers to make her his wife. Cue several hundred more pages of fluttering eyelashes and betrothals of eternal love.

Lots has been written about this book defining the novel and illustrating the changing the changing master/servant relationships of the time. What? The novel had been around for more than a century and was already popular and in rude health. And there were far better writers working at the time, such as Henry Fielding who mercilessly lambasted this work with his parody . And as for throwing light on the master/servant relationship, this book bears no more relationship to reality than the reams of romantic Mills and Boon literature it has inspired. Let's not forget, this book was published twenty years after , a book which has so much more to say about the possibilities of a woman's place in 18th Century England, as well as being far better written and still more relevant today - as I'm sure it was then - and more realistic (okay, in a different stratum of society, and realistic in the challenges Moll faces rather than her survival of them, but my point still stands).

Yes, it took books years to circulate, but Richardson was a publisher in London. He was aware of Moll Flanders and books inspired by it, and deliberately set out to write books that were 'conduct letters' on how a young lady should behave (he was also a publisher of some wealth and standing, and it is debatable that his books would have been the success they were had he not had the power to print and market them). He wasn't saying that virtue and a good marriage were the most a woman could expect from life, he was saying that the most she can expect from life. There are no grey areas. Pamela resists the squire's advances and her virtue is rewarded. I understand Clarissa does have much more depth (perhaps Richardson was truly stung by Fielding's riposte), but he still sticks with the horribly clunky epistolary style.

I would certainly recommend reading it, as I did, as part of a sequence showing how the English novel developed (Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Fanny Burney, etc - although I also wish this had included some European literature which of course had a huge influence on Britain - remember most educated people read French, Latin and possibly Italian - and almost all forms and styles were imported from the continent)."
Pamela,Patrick Hennessy,"August 28, 2007",2.0,"read the one thousand plus pages or just the title, which also tells the whole story"
Pamela,Michael,"August 18, 2017",2.0,Undoubtedly I was far too young to appreciate this when I was assigned it as an undergraduate. I will have to revisit it at some point.
Pamela,Sherwood Smith,"September 20, 2014",,"Reading this is like watching the invention of literature before your eyes. Richardson began this as yet another work-for-hire series of ""conduct letters"" of the sort that Madame De La Fayette et al made popular during the 1600s, but the story took off in such a way that it became more like, oh, a reality show that develops into its own story. Richardson developed the narrative ""a l'moment"" approach, that is, slipping inside the character's skin and reporting on what they were thinking and feeling at the moment. The effect was riveting.

The plot is simplistic: Pamela spends 500 pages keeping her virtue from her lord and master, Mr. B--; like Beaumarchais's comedy, here, for the first time, we have a commoner as hero, who brings the lord to heel.

We also get a close look at relationships and how marriages were made. The lists the two made up for marriage are quite enlightening.

This novel became a multimedia event: there were plates and fashions and posters and all kinds of Pamela stuff . . . and of course the satires! Even Eliza Haywood got into the act, with her but the most famous is Fielding's with its long beginning full of puffery between writers busy praising each other, and its pokes at the government of the time for barefaced piracy in order to make the rich richer, and shaft the rest of the nation.

Nowadays few read it outside of school, and for the average eighteen year old yawning through an Intro to Lit course, this story of the maid who protects her virtue despite various attempts against it until she is rewarded with love, position, wealth, and respect, seems really silly. One might even wonder why the heck it was so popular a best seller as to propel its author to the front ranks of 1740s fictioneering.

Well, part of the answer lies in the plot—instead of writing about a protagonist in high life, Richardson chose a working girl from a humble background. She’s a housemaid. There were a whole lot of people of ordinary walks of life who really liked this story of a humble girl making good. But for the more sophisticated readers, it’s the narrative voice that was so stunning. The accepted frame of novels had been the narrator writing after the fact, and though there were epistolary novels aplenty, they too largely affected that flat distance. Richardson’s novel engaged successfully with immediacy–Pamela and the rest desperately writing letters within minutes after the exciting events they relate.

Exciting as it was, the novel also opened Richardson up to parody: at one point in Fielding’s the eponymous heroine notes in one of her desperate letters that there are three people in a bed, and two of them are shamming sleep so they can scribble their latest adventures. People are hopping in and out of rooms, busily scribbling to one another in secret in between bawdy adventures.

Fielding actually suppressed after two quick editions (the second with fast emendations to poke at some political developments of the time). The book that drew my eye was one scarcely mentioned by my English prof way back when: , the companion volume Fielding wrote. This novel concerns Pamela’s brother, who is a good-looking young man taken in as a footman, and who wishes to preserve his virtue, despite the strenuous efforts of the various women of his acquaintaince, from the lady who employs him down to her own servants, to romance him. After a long, extremely funny scene of hinting around, and Joseph being steadfast in his refusal to take the hints, Lady Booby cries out, “Did ever Mortal hear of a Man’s Virtue?”

Fielding goes on to stick his quill into the complacent, civilized, and practiced corruption of the government of the time, the selfish attitudes of people toward those in want, and he makes a lot of really nasty jibes against the actor Colley Cibber, whose recent autobiography had not just dismissed Fielding with one condescending reference, but apparently is most disingenuous in its self-aggrandizement. No version of Entertainment Weekly or Jon Stewart could be more gossipy or satiric about current celebrities, or governmental shenanigans.

I love eighteenth century novels for their bawdy freedom, their slapstick action trading off with wit. Few are written in stylish prose, they are bumpy and jerky in construction as their authors, writing fast, explored the possibilities of narration, plot, character, and voice–they were busy inventing the novel, as there were no rules. Those novels are chock-full of real life detail that the more refined writers of the 19th century draw the veil of delicacy over, but which are most enlightening to us. The plots creak with what later became cliché, but one discovers where the clichés originated."
Pamela,Penelope Irving,"February 3, 2015",4.0,"Come on, Goodreads - surely Richardson deserves at least four stars for inventing the novel? Pamela was the first time the full potential of long prose narrative was realised as a form that could explore character and psychology as well as tell a story. By hitting on the concept of the epistolary novel almost by accident (Pamela grew out of a non-fiction book of letter templates that Richardson had been commissioned to write), Richardson's discovery of 'writing to the moment' set English and indeed world literature on a whole new path. He was a major influence on Jane Austen, and in his time was universally read.

While the thoughtworld of the mid eighteenth century is far removed from ours, some of the values central to Pamela should not be so difficult for us to relate to. Society today takes the issue of consent in a sexual relationship extremely seriously, particularly female consent - far more seriously, indeed, than it was taken in the 1740s, when there was a widespread assumption that lower-class women were probably up for it, and could only be blamed if they 'fell'. At the centre of this book is Pamela's spirited struggle to maintain her right to withhold her consent, in the face of a major power imbalance between herself and Mr B, and the prevailing social mores which (as more than one peripheral character comments) would have her be grateful for his attention and take his money in exchange for sex. Pamela might be preachy but she is also smart, strong, perceptive and gives Mr B no quarter until she can bring him to her own terms. At its core, it's a message modern readers ought to be able to get behind.

Yes, the book is a bit long and repetitive, but the novel was at such an early stage of development that it can be given a lot of leeway for faults in form. Clarissa, which followed it, is much longer - and much better.

I admit to a long-time soft spot for Richardson. I even considered doing postgraduate work on him at one point, and must be one of the few people alive who have actually read Sir Charles Grandison all the way through. But Pamela occupies a unique place in the history of English literature - in the history of media entertainment, overall - and it deserves respect."
Pamela,Abbie,"September 27, 2007",2.0,"Anyone who's had the Sisyphean task of reading this shares a cosmic bond: if you have, you know what I mean. This and ""Dear Mr. Henshaw"" make me want to slit my own wrists in reaction to the idea of the epistolary novel. Fucking Pamela is one dipshit of a girl, but Richardson himself is no better. Any time I see a terrible, modern didactic novel I feel reassured knowing it will end up as beloved & well-known as this one in the future."
Pamela,Heather,"October 30, 2008",2.0,"I really didn't like this book. My British novel professor assures me that my affection for it will grow over the years, but I somehow doubt that at this point. Pamela is a dangerous picture of womanhood... she is largely responsible for the whole ""women have power in powerlessness"" idea that left many, many women abused and riddled with the sexually transmitted diseases their husbands brought home in the 18th and 19th centuries. Because of Pamela, I'm sure they often believed that if they were just virtuous ENOUGH, their husbands would be shamed into changing their ways. Richardson is also clearly fascinated with the many near-rape scenes he writes in great detail, and places a great deal of importance on the role of Pamela's letters (his own writing) in the narrative. The only good things I have to say about it are that it is occasionally beautiful (I really like the line that goes something like, ""Why Pamela, you are like an April day - you cry and laugh in a breath."") and in a way, it is ridiculously funny at times. Overall it was worth reading as an an enormously influential classic novel, but the feminist in me wishes it had never been written."
Pamela,Emma,"October 10, 2017",1.0,"Reader, I hated it."
Pamela,Classic reverie,"August 30, 2018",5.0,"After reading Samuel Richardson's Clarissa Harlowe, I knew I had to read his first novel ""Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded"". Richardson was a printer and was urged by his friends to help illiterate population by examples of some form letters to help guide & instruct. His epistolary style was praised & the idea of Pamela came to be. He also wanted to instruct young people about the importance of God & virtuous living. Pamela was received with favorable following that he soon followed up with a sequel ""Pamela in Her Exalted Condition"". After finishing the first Pamela, I could not wait to read the whole story. This story had many of the same themes as Clarissa but with a different spin. The story is told in letters instead of chapters. The letters are not dated but the receiver & writer is revealed to us. In Virtue Rewarded Pamela Andrews is writing to her parents who are extremely poor due to occurrences of not their doing. Pamela is sent away at a young age of 10 years old to become a Lady's maidservant & becomes the favorite. In the letters to her parents she tells them of her Lady's death which recently occurred. Mr. B. (who is 25 years old), the Lady's son takes a liking to 16 year old Pamela. Unaware of any trouble coming her way & wondering about certain kindness the son gives to her she writes her parents for advice & they give it to her. She finds herself in a precarious situations which are governed by her wise & prudent behavior learned early in life by her parents, her religion & her Lady. Mr. B. is soon found to have a libertine background which makes Pamela fearful for herself & her virtue. Lady Davers, Mr. B's sister is concerned for the young girl & her brother's reputation. Pamela being poor & the Lady's family being rich. Lady Daver's is quite cross with her brother who seems to be thinking of his own desires which are not honorable. The second book tells of Pamela in her married state which has her dealing with jealously & an unknown future. Lady Davers & her husband's relative Mr. H. & his character comes into question.Both of these books compare living life with & without virtue & examples of both are given. Many different characters & their results of which path they took are the focus of both these books. The second book has several letters commenting on John Locke's Treatise of Education which was quite interesting in comparing life in the 18th century & present day. I found the arguments for & against breast feeding an infant extremely interesting because many classic novels have wet nurses so the mothers are free from this activity. Pamela is so desirous of this activity but her husband is against this. She is disappointed but submits to his wishes. Reading older books you have an idea what some of societies' problems & issues were living during that period in time. A few quotes- that caught my eye-""Mr. Locke says, that he has known a child so distracted with the number and variety of his playthings, that he tired his maid every day to look them over: and was so accustomed to abundance, that he never thought he had enough, but was always asking, ""What more? What new thing shall I have? -""A good introduction,"" adds he, ironically, ""to moderate desires, and the ready way to make a contented happy man.""This quote reminds us all that no matter who we are rich or poor we come to the same end & God is the judge of all our doings & only our actions are important.""Does various parts for various minds dispense: The meanest slaves, or those who hedge and ditch, Are useful, by their sweat, to feed the rich. The rich, in due return, impart their store; Which comfortably feeds the lab'ring poor. Nor let the rich the lowest slave distain: He's equally a link of Nature's chain: Labours to the same end, joins in one view; And both alike the will divine pursue; And, at the last, are levell'd, king and slave, Without distinction, in the silent grave."""
Pamela,Cristal,"April 16, 2013",1.0,"(I would like to point out that the following review is more of a rant than a proper review and will be of no benefit for those wishing to ascertain the quality of the novel)

I have rated this book so low, not because it lacks literary value, but because the plot alone is abhorrent to my delicate sensibilities. This poor girl is sexually assaulted several times as Mr. B makes multiple attempts to rape her and THEN (because she refuses to be violated) she is tricked into a several month long imprisonment with cruel and unrelenting servants of Mr. B, driven to desperate escape attempts and suicidal thoughts. And when Mr. B comes to this prison home, he tries to rape her AGAIN by having the housekeeper hold her down. Did I mention he hides in closets (plural, as in he does it more than once!), steals her letters, and disguises as a maid in the name of his 'love'? I could spend days yelling about the wrongness of what happens.

And what is to be the reward of her virtue? SHE GETS TO MARRY HER ASSAULTER!

Seriously, she marries the 'reformed' Mr. B. Yeah, she's rich now. Good for her. But she is married to the man who did all of ^that^ to her. Not ok.

Another thing. She spends the rest of the novel married and effusively thankful to him. No. She should not be on her knees, groveling for how he has raised her above her station. She hasn't been given a great honor. She has suffered from a severe case of Stockholm syndrome.

And I'm telling you what, if this were real, and (like in the novel) her father tracked them down, he would not be mincing words and wringing his hands. No matter how poor he was, he'd be grabbing a musket and getting poor Pamela out of there, any means necessary."

Confession: I love Samuel Richardson. I love . I love . I love the wicked Mr. B-, who practically twirls his mustache as he looms in corners, waiting for 'poor unhappy Pamela' to drop her defenses (and her drawers) so he can steal her sweet, sweet virtue. I love the ridiculous plot that somehow is not ridiculous when drawn out & elaborated piece-by-piece by Richardson. (A reader's version of Stockholm syndrome, perhaps? After spending 300 pages on a book, do we automatically believe ?)

Other readers criticize unhappy Pamela for her docility, her passivity, her calf eyes and willingness to trust Mr. B- after having proof time and time again that he is just up to . I remind them of her escape, her lies, her dissembling and her general under-the-radar intelligence. She's hampered by virtue, not stupidity.

And oh! most of all I love the sunflower scene.

Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded is an ""epistolary novel"" by Samuel Richardson, first published in 1740. It tells the story of a beautiful but poor 15-year old servant-maid named Pamela Andrews whose master, Mr. B, a nobleman, makes unwanted advances towards her after the death of his mother whose maid she was since the age of 12. Mr. B is infatuated with her, first by her looks and then her innocence and intelligence but his high rank hinders him from proposing marriage. He abducts her and locks her up in one of his estates and attempts to seduce and rape her. She rejects him continually refusing to be his mistress though she begins to realize that she is falling in love with him. He intercepts and reads her letters to her parents and becomes even more enamored by her innocence and intelligence and her continuous attempts to escape. Her virtue is eventually rewarded when he shows his sincerity by proposing an equitable marriage to her as his legal wife. In the second part of the novel, Pamela attempts to accommodate herself to upper-class society and to build a successful relationship with him. The story was a bestseller of its time and was very widely read, even though it also received criticism for its perceived licentiousness.
British Literature at it's BEST..your Patience will be rewarded!"
Pamela,Lucinda Elliot,"July 31, 2018",3.0,"Two and a half stars, because I always give generous ratings. This story unfortunately romanticises abuse and rape. If this hadn't been written two hundred and fifty years ago, I'd give it one star for portaying a woman marrying her would be rapist.

Samuel Richardson’s reputation, for so long as bad as it could be among critics, has in recent decades had something of a revival. This is generally among literary scholars, as the length of his works is enough to put off all but the most geekish or courageous of readers (count me among the said geeks). These days, the subtlety of his characterisation, and the complex significance of his use of incident, are now discussed as avidly as once were the scorn and disgust aroused in readers by his self serving Puritanical morality.

Typically awkward, I think this is a loss, because I fully agree with Coleridge’s conclusion about Richardson’s work:

‘I confess it has cost, and still costs, my philosophy some exertion not to be vexed that I must admire, aye, greatly admire, Richardson. His mind is so very vile, a mind so oozy, so hypocritical, praise mad, canting, envious, concupiscent.’

Richardson's writing has a compulsion which one feels has got little to do with literary value, or the creation of sympathetic characters, believable situations, or strong writing.

In fact, after ploughing through ‘Pamela’ 'Pamela in her Exalted Condition, ‘Clarissa’ and part of ‘The History of Sir Charles Grandison’ I can safely state that Richardson is devoted to purple prose.

Unfortunately, this may be why – with his favourite theme being that of female virtue besieged - in an age discovering ‘sensibility’, so many of his inner circle of toadying admirers and literary advisors were women. They wished to explore the ‘female sphere’ of the emotive that this male writer was prepared to take seriously in his writing, and in their enthusiasm for this they seem to have blinded themselves both to the inadequacies of his verbose, florid style and the dismal limitations of the sort of respect for women offered by his Puritan convictions.

It is intriguing that in their discussions, they often employed much the same arguments that are used today in defences on the literary value of the romance novel. In fact, current writers on the value of the romance novel take a stand against the ‘anti-Pamela-ists’ precisely because they define ‘Pamela’ as the first romantic novel.

Richardson wrote two hundred years before Freud’s discoveries of sexuality and the unconscious laid bare the source of his appeal, already hinted at by Henry Fielding and Eliza Heywood. In D H Lawrence’s words, he offered voyeuristic ‘Calico purity and underclothes excitement…Boccacio at his hottest seems to me less pornographic than ‘Pamela’ or ‘Clarissa’.

If this seems wonderfully biting, then the critic V S Pritchard in ‘The Living Novel’ goes further:

‘Prurient, and obsessed by sex, the prim Richardson creeps on tiptoe nearer and nearer, inch by inch…he beckons us on, pausing to make every sort of pious protestation, and then nearer and nearer he creeps again…’

This is hilarious, and very apt.

Another critic, Frank Bradbrook in his essay on Richardson ‘The Pelican Guide to English Literature’ remarks trenchantly, ‘Pamela is sentimental and obscene; its obscenity is a direct result of its sentimentality.’

I have to agree with these criticisms, which makes me into an ‘anti Pamela-ist’. But I am even more of an ‘Anti Mr B-ist’ I don’t think Richardson’s heroine is alone in a hypocrite. Mr B is even more of one than Pamela.

Regarding Pamela’s hypocrisy, as soon as her master offers to marry her, he ceases to be a villain in her eyes, and she never asks for an explanation or apology for his abusive treatment of her. In elevating her to his own status, Squire B has put his late mother’s lady’s maid under such a sense of obligation that he can only be her ‘beloved Master’ even if he did attempt to rape her at least once, and sexually assaulted her on numerous occasions.

As for M B’s hypocrisy, apart from his absurd earlier outrage that she has dared to defy him and write accounts of his attempts on her, there is his later astounding self complacency. He is supposed to have undergone a moral metamorphesis triggered by reading her journal. One might think that this would have made him a little confused and diffident about himself, and the value of his opinions. Far from it. As soon as he gives up his attempts on her and decides to marry her, he suddenly shows an incongruous tendency to express pompous views about marriage and a wife’s duty.

Here he is clearly Richardson’s mouthpiece. Still, the contrast between this new persona, and his former behaviour as a self confessed rake, are frankly ludicrous.

The revival of Richardson’s reputation seems to have been partly promoted by the writings of the US academic Mark Kinkead Weekes, and in particular his 1973 book ‘Samuel Richardson: Dramatic Novelist’.

I found Kinkead Weekes’ book intriguing, though I disagree with his conclusions, while I found the parts which defend both heroine and the anti hero Mr B in ‘Pamela’, not only unconvincing but downright offensive to women readers.

It has to be said in Kinkead Weekes’ defence, that this book was written in 1973, when the views about the depiction of sexual violence against women in novels was very different.

It is an intriguing thing that Kinkead Weekes considers the scheming unrepentant Lovelace – the rapist anti-hero of ‘Clarissa’ – as a very evil man. But Mr B, by dint of his facile reform is another case altogether.

In ‘Pamela in her Exalted Condition’ Richardson was later to have Mr B deny that his first seeming attempt on Pamela, where he leaps out of a closet, climbs into bed with her and the housekeeper,and thrusts a hand down her bosom was an atempted rape, and indeed, it is hard to see how he would have contemplated carrying one out in front of Mrs Jervis. However, that piece of punishment through sexual assault is ugly enough, and later in the novel, he does carry out a genuine rape attempt.

Kinkead Weekes goes on to say of Mr B’s second attempt (also made in the presence of another woman, this time the wicked housekeeper Mrs Jewkers: she holds Pamela down, as do the prostitutes in ‘Clarissa’; Richardson did seem to have a rather odd thing about exhibitionist rapes)

‘The final attempt does begin with the intention of rape, though for revenge and subjugation, not desire- but it continues in stubborn pride, unwilling to give in to fear of wrongdoing, and trying hopelessly to salvage something. …It is the last kick of B’s pride, brought remorselessly to face its consequences in the ‘death’ (Pamela has a fit) of the girl he loves. The result is tenderness, and there is no need for B’s subsequent change to seem surprising.’

I see; readers have been told that they are not ‘reading carefully’ if they find his subsequent reformation abrupt and unconvincing. We are also told repeatedly that Pamela is not a hypocrite for accepting such a man when he changes to making ‘respectable’ offers of marriage.

‘It is open to the critic to say that it is immoral to love a man who has behaved like B, even if he seems to have made a break with his past, and that it is immoral to be able to blot out that past in a forgiveness excessive enough to rank repentant sinners ‘in the rank of the most virtuous’/ Only, if that is what we want to say, let us say it clearly, in awareness of what saying it implies. Let us not, on the other hand, talk too much about the jewel market.’

What I would say in response to that, is that of course, Pamela should have forgiven such a man as Mr B. But that she should not have married him.

Strangely enough, Kinkaed Weekes thoroughly endorses Clarissa’s combining forgiveness of Lovelace with an absolute refusal to marry him. While it might be argued that this is because Lovelace never really repents, he says he does. He is willing to marry Clarissa, believing that will put matters right.

I see very little moral difference between the two rapist anti heroes, save that the first is less of a compulsive schemer, and more of a hypocrite, who decides he will obtain more pleasure in joining Pamela in ‘innocent pleasures’ with her as his servile worshipper, and in going about the country giving tedious moral lectures to the neighbours than in jumping out of closets to thrust his hand down her bosom.

Tastes change, I suppose…"
Pamela,Sotiris Karaiskos,"October 2, 2018",3.0,"Some of the 18th century books are particularly dislikeful to the modern audience because they consider them to be overly emotional, conservative that they have a particular didactic tone and that their writers for the most part simply do preaching, denouncing the immorality of their time. In this book, however, similar criticism has also been made in his era. It was, of course, a particularly popular book, but at the same time it was a target of very strict criticism that ended in ridicule.

The truth is that in this case the accusations are based on fact as the main purpose of the writer through his story is to pass moral lessons, showing, in fact, that in the end virtue is always rewarded. The didactic tone is diffused on all its pages, until it finally reaches the point of showing the reader exactly how to interpret what he has read. Beyond that, however, I found in it a particularly intense social critique and analysis of class differences. The book's heroine does not simply resist temptations by making ethical decisions, ignoring the financial reward, is called upon to face the pressure of a rich man who has the ability to use his wealth and the influence he has in society to force her to succumb and become his mistress, losing her dignity forever. This social critique continues in the second part where her reward for her behavior is a rich marriage, and there we see the enormous social difference facing the hostility of relatives and friends who point to the inappropriateness of this relationship, thus revealing the perceptions that prevailed in this era on social classes.

Of course the truth is that the author makes this criticism in a rather subdued way without reaching the bottom, choosing to confine himself to the emotional side and the weight that the heroine feels under such conditions. After a first part more emotionally intense, where the author describes in a very nice way our heroine's anxiety, this subtlety makes the story lose its momentum. In this way the opportunity for this book to be more than just an ordinary romantic story is lost. Of course for readers who are more concerned with the history of literature retain its usefulness as we see things that we find later in other writers. So in the end, to make the addition, we have an interesting story that illuminates some aspects of the time that was written and is showing us a bit of the evolution of literature. That is why I must be lenient though I confess that in many places I just read it to finish and write this review.

Κάποια από τα βιβλία του 18ου αιώνα είναι ιδιαίτερα αντιπαθητικά στο σύγχρονο κοινό γιατί τα θεωρούν υπερβολικά συναισθηματικά, συντηρητικά, ότι έχουν ιδιαίτερα διδακτικό τόνο και ότι οι συγγραφείς τους στο μεγαλύτερο μέρος τους απλά κάνουν κήρυγμα, καταγγέλλοντας την ανηθικότητα της εποχής τους. Σε αυτό το βιβλίο, όμως, ανάλογη κριτική είχε γίνει και στην εποχή του. Ήταν, φυσικά, ένα ιδιαίτερα δημοφιλές βιβλίο αλλά παράλ��ηλα ήταν στόχος πολύ αυστηρής κριτικής που κατέληγε στον χλευασμό.

Η αλήθεια είναι ότι σε αυτή την περίπτωση οι κατηγορίες έχουν βάση καθώς ο συγγραφέας έχει ως κύριο σκοπό μέσα από την ιστορία του να περάσει ηθικά διδάγματα, δείχνοντας, μάλιστα, ότι στο τέλος η αρετή πάντα ανταμείβεται. Ο διδακτικός τόνος είναι διάχυτος σε όλες τις σελίδες του, Μέχρι που στο τέλος φτάνει σε σημείο να επιδεικνύει στον αναγνώστη πώς ακριβώς πρέπει να ερμηνεύσει αυτά που διάβασε. Πέρα από αυτό, όμως, εγώ βρήκα σε αυτό ιδιαίτερα έντονη κοινωνική κριτική και ανάλυση πάνω στις ταξικές διαφορές. Η ηρωίδα του βιβλίου δεν αντιστέκεται απλά στους πειρασμούς παίρνοντας ηθικά σωστές αποφάσεις, αγνοώντας την οικονομική ανταμοιβή, καλείται να αντιμετωπίσει την πίεση ενός πλούσιου που έχει τη δυνατότητα να χρησιμοποιεί τον πλούτο και την επιρροή που έχει στην κοινωνία για να την εξαναγκάσει να υποκύψει και να γίνει ερωμένη του χάνοντας μία για πάντα την αξιοπρέπειά της. Αυτή η κοινωνική κριτική συνεχίζεται και στο δεύτερο μέρος όπου η ανταμοιβή της για τη συμπεριφορά της είναι ένας πλούσιος γάμος και εκεί βλέπουμε η τεράστια κοινωνική διαφορά να αντιμετωπίζει την εχθρότητα συγγενών και φίλων που επισημαίνουν το αταίριαστο αυτής της σχέσης, αποκαλύπτοντας έτσι τις αντιλήψεις που επικρατούσαν εκείνη την εποχή για τις κοινωνικές τάξεις.

Βέβαια η αλήθεια είναι ότι ο συγγραφέας κάνει αυτή την κριτική με μάλλον υποτονικό τρόπο χωρίς να φτάνει στην ουσία, επιλέγοντας να περιοριστεί στη συναισθηματική πλευρά και το βάρος που νιώθει η ηρωίδα κάτω από τέτοιες συνθήκες. Μετά από ένα πρώτο μέρος περισσότερο συναισθηματικά έντονο, όπου ο συγγραφέας περιγράφει με πολύ ωραίο τρόπο την αγωνία της ηρωίδας μας, αυτή η υποτονικότητα κάνει την ιστορία να χάνει τη δυναμική της. Έτσι χάνεται η ευκαιρία για να είναι αυτό το βιβλίο κάτι περισσότερο από μία συνηθισμένη ρομαντική ιστορία. Βέβαια στους αναγνώστες που ασχολούνται περισσότερο με την ιστορία της λογοτεχνίας διατηρεί τη χρησιμότητα του καθώς σε αυτό βλέπουμε πράγματα που συναντάμε αργότερα σε άλλους συγγραφείς. Οπότε στο τέλος, για να κάνω την πρόσθεση, έχουμε μία ενδιαφέρουσα ιστορία που φωτίζει κάποιες πτυχές της εποχής που γράφτηκε δείχνοντάς μας ένα κομμάτι της εξέλιξής της λογοτεχνίας, Για αυτό πρέπει να είμαι επιεικής αν και ομολογώ ότι σε πολλά σημεία απλά διάβαζα γιατί έπρεπε να το τελειώσω και να γράψω αυτήν την κριτική."

Samuel Richardson's novel Pamela, Or Virtue Rewarded was on my reading list in a course on the early novel back in the 1970s. When I saw the Dover edition based on the 1741 edition of the novel on NetGalley I requested it to see why we should read it today.
Pamela's Story

Samuel Richardson (1689-1761) was over fifty years old when a bookseller asked him to write sample letters to teach the art of letter writing to the unskilled. Richardson had little formal education, having been born in the working class, but he loved to read.

He created the character of Pamela, a fifteen-year-old girl who writes letters home to her impoverish parents. Pamela is a maidservent to a titled lady. As the book opens the Lady has died and her son is now Master of the house. He realizes that the little girl Pamela has grown into a sixteen-year-old beauty. Pamela has been educated and dressed to pass flawlessly among good society.

The Master is a Rake. He does not believe in marriage, but he believes in the seduction of powerless young women. Pamela is a devote Christian and an obedient child who has been taught that her Virtue must be kept intact. She fends off the Master, even as he turns up the pressure and changes his tactics. Pamela endures a near rape experience, kidnapping, isolation, temptation to commit suicide, an offer of fiscal security for herself and her parents, and even professions of love.

After several hundred pages (both in the novel and in his letter reading!) the Master realizes that Pamela is the real thing-- and worthy of becoming his bride. In fact he decides she is the only woman he could marry. She has proven herself to be a better person than the high born ladies he has known: obedient, humble, open, pure, wise, obedient, and virtuous.

Suddenly Pamela realizes she loves the Master, that she always did, and now he is a reformed Rake she can admit it.

Questions arise in the reader: Was Pamela play acting, holding out like Anne Boylan who teased Henry VIII into marriage, or was she honest? How can she forgive the Master for months of terror and hell and marry him? She always said she did not and could not hate him, that if he would only behave properly she could forgive him. But there is a lot to forgive.

Pamela continually thanks God for her good fortune--and her Master for such condescension as to marry so below him. Because Pamela is aware of the great sacrifice her Master has made in marrying her she retains his old title of her Master.

Pamela's ordeal is not yet over; she has to meet his friends and prove herself all over again to his vengeful sister. Finally even sis has to agree that Pam is not a gold-digger, but is virtuous and pure and worthy of her brother.

""...when you are so good, like the slender Reed, to bend to the Hurricane, rather than, like the sturdy Oak, to resist it, you will always stand firm in my kind Opinion, while a contrary Conduct would uproot you, with all your Excellencies, from my Soul."" --the Master to Pamela

All is not yet well. The Master gets mad at Pamela lectures her on how to behave like a proper wife: bend like a reed to his whims. The book ends with a 48-point list of all Pamela has learned about proper behavior and expectations.

Pamela in 1740

Richardson's book had a strong story line and a sympathetic character. The melodrama brought men and women alike to tears as they feared for Pamela's well being. The book flew off the shelves--the first best seller.

The book was a cultural game changer. People marketed Pamela mop caps and tea cups and fans and Richardson playing cards. It was quoted in sermons. The story was turned into plays and operas.

The sexual situations pushed the borders of the acceptable: as Pamela resists her Master's increasingly forceful attentions she finds herself in ever more tenuous situations. Undressed and in bed, her Master in disguise climbs in with her. When Pamela is kept hostage he tries to rape her; she is saved only because she passes out. There was controversy: Is this a book about proper conduct, or was it ""thinly veiled pornography""?

Literary Influences

Writers satirized and copied the book. Henry Fielding's copycat book stars Shamela Andrews who sets out to seduce the squire to trick him into marriage. (Richardson's squire (a.k.a. the Master) was seduced while at college; the lady immigrated to America and a new life, leaving their child behind for the squire's sister to raise.) Novels about the trials of females in love proliferated; Pamela showed that people wanted to read about the female experience.

Richardson went on to write two more books, Clarissa and the Austen family favorite, Sir Charles Grandison. Richardson's books influenced Jane Austen whose first drafts of Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice were epistolary. The use of letters is important in Austen's novels.

Richardson's epistolary style allowed Pamela's voice an immediacy that brings the reader into her emotional and mental life. After the failure of Pamela's fake suicide to escape from her Master she is brought to her lowest point, even to considering actually committing suicide. She grapples with the implications of such an act:

""And wilt thou, for shortening thy transitory Griefs, heavy as they are, and weak as thou fanciest thyself, plunge both Body and Soul into everlasting Misery?...because wicked Men persecute thee, wilt though fly in the Face of the Almighty and bid Defiance to his Grace and Goodness, who can still turn all these Sufferings to thy Benefits? And how do I know, but that God, who sees all the lurking Vileness of my Heart, may not have permitted these Sufferings on that very Score, and to make me rely solely on his Grace and Assistance, who perhaps have too much prided myself in a vain Dependence on my own foolish Contrivances?""

This dramatic scene had to make readers weep for Pamela, even as it instructs readers to a Christian attitude toward suffering: complete reliance upon and trust in God.

Ways to Relate to Pamela

Today's reader can learn about the society of 1740. From coaches to dress to class to coaches to drinks, every aspect of life can be discovered. In a happy scene a drink with a toast and spices is shared, with everybody having a piece of the toast. Now I know where 'toasting' came from.

The book is democratic. Richardson's working class viewpoint is evident. His titled and privileged classes were NOT superior. In fact, in the last part of the story the Master himself confesses that his kind were badly coddled and not taught self restraint.

The subtitle Or Virtue Rewarded could have also been The Reformation of A Rake, as Pamela brings the Master to choose marriage over debauchery and reform his manners and morals. His sister is shocked to hear her brother talking like a 'preacher'!

Pamela faces every instance of abuse against women, all of which continues to this day: kidnapping, rape, pressure for sexual favors from those in power, workplace abuse.

In Pamela we get a foretaste of the Victorian Angel in the House, the female whose presence raises the moral fiber of the entire household.

Class in 1740 is well described: A man raises a wife into his class whereas a woman of rank debases herself by marrying beneath her. Pamela has all the attributes the Master considers primary in a woman to make him happy, including her setting him as her Master to whom she is obedient in all things. Actually, she is the only woman who could fit the bill. No high born lady would tolerate his demands for primacy in all things.

""...I am not perfect myself: No, I am greatly imperfect. yet will I not allow, that my Imperfections shall excuse those of my Wife, or make her thin I ought to bear Faults in her, that she can rectify, because she bears greater from me."" said by the squire to Pamela

In that list of rules Pamela has compiled is No. 21: That Love before Marriage is absolutely necessary. A very contemporary idea! Also one Jane Austen professed; that is why she backed out of an accepted proposal of marriage--she knew she didn't love the man.

Other rules, such as ""the words Command and Obey shall be blotted out of his Vocabulary"" and ""a Man should desire nothing of his Wife but what is significant, reasonable, just"" are surprisingly humane at a time when women were powerless in marriage.

Did you watch Poldark on Masterpiece Theater this past year? What happened? Poldark bedded then married his scullery maid, who then underwent social ostracism until she proves herself? That is very like the second part of Pamela's story. It was Richardson's book that started a landslide of books about the female experience.

Conclusion
There were times when Pamela's voice and character were strong and moving. And many pages which I couldn't wait to get through; often this happened when Pamela was retelling her story to new people or in the second volume when Richardson was refreshing readers on events from the first volume. Pamela is heroic in her standing up to adversity with moral fortitude. She is also always humble and non-confrontational, engendering Non-violent resistance. In these ways we can admire her.

I am glad to have read the novel after forty years. I would love to be back in a classroom setting to discuss it. My book club members, especially the women, would hate Pamela for her passivity and acceptance of her rank in the class structure. They would rail at her marriage to the undeserving Master. They would leave the book unfinished. The wish fulfillment ending for the 1740s audience would not appeal to contemporary liberated gals. Those who enjoy the classics and the experience of reading works that established the genre will find much to learn and enjoy from Pamela.

The Dover edition offers exactly what the original readers found in their hands. There are no footnotes or articles about Richardson or the novel.

I received a free ebook from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
Pamela,Matthew Gatheringwater,"August 29, 2007",3.0,"I imagine that most people today read this book to laugh at its outdated morality. Certainly, there is something funny in the premise of the story: Pamela, a poor but dignified servant girl, attracts the attention of a rich squire who deceives and kidnaps her but somehow is so impressed by her natural modesty and virtue that he is reluctant to take outright from her what she is unwilling to give.

One way to read the novel (a way that must certainly have contributed to the book's initial popularity and controversy) is to take a kind of perverse pleasure in anticipating what new indignity poor Pamela will next be subjected and how her next attempt at escape will be thwarted by the evil (but attractive) squire.

I laughed at the outdated sexual morality, too, but found other, surprisingly progressive, aspects of the novel to be sobering and touching.

For example, it is Pamela's behavior, not her class or economic position, that makes her admirable both to the squire and to the reader. One may argue that Pamela would not have been a representative waiting-maid (her education and vocabulary, for example, are more than one would expect), but her nobility of character seems to foreshadow a redefinition of gentility that would become such an important theme to Victorian-era novelists.

For all her primness, Pamela is unexpectedly powerful. A pair of docile cows may once thwart her escape from the squire, but it is ultimately she who prevails over him. Her words have the power to change minds and character. The novel is presented as a series of letters from her to her parents, but they become mixed up in the plot, when her captor discovers she is writing. Nowhere in the novel does their symbolic power get more mixed up with her sexual power than when the squire reaches up under her dress to steal letters hidden in her petticoats--a salacious scene indeed, for a novel the author claimed was “to Divert and Entertain, and at the same time to Instruct, and Improve the Minds of the YOUTH of both Sexes.”"
Pamela,Roman Clodia,"December 30, 2019",3.0,"Pamela is one of those books that always has to appear on undergraduate courses on the history of the novel because it was so influential but it is undoubtedly a book which hasn't stood the tests of time well and which is a difficult book for us to read today. Told in epistolary form, it tells the story of Pamela, a servant girl, pursued obsessively by her master who hides in cupboards, gropes her , assaults her and oh so nearly rapes her until they finally get married...!

So, ok, the story itself might be pretty offensive to us today and the method of telling is frequently repetitive, but it does tell us quite a lot about the culture, gender relations, and role of literature of the time in which it was written. Realism wasn't necessarily what Richardson was aiming for, and neither is the sort of psychological dimension which appears in the C19th alongside the growth of scientific pyschology.

So this is very much a book which you have to take on its own terms - it certainly won't be for everyone but does have a strange kind of vitality and energy of its own."
Pamela,Abigail Bok,"December 24, 2021",3.0,"For the first half of this book I wanted nothing so much as to take a shower, so icky did I find its drawn-out rape fantasy. For the second half of the book I wanted to vomit at the treacly virtue-signaling. But after I finished it I was reluctantly impressed by its aims and strategy, by its subversive effects. What changed my mind, or at least expanded my view? Read on.

First, a bit about the story. Pamela Andrews is a fifteen-year-old maidservant in a wealthy woman��s household. She is beloved of her mistress, who treats her kindly and is training her in some of the skills and accomplishments of a girl of better breeding. Her mistress dies suddenly, and Pamela finds herself now in the household of the elder lady’s twenty-something son. Pamela is initially not too worried; the son has always been kind and respectful to her.

But soon he starts trying to take liberties with her, and she resists. In a series of letters to her parents and later a journal written for their perusal, she writes of her fear and attempts to protect her virtue. Her master is angry and punishes her for her resistance; eventually he has her kidnapped and taken to another of his houses, where he has a housekeeper who is compliant to his wishes and keeps her prisoner till he can have his way with her. This persecution continues for half the book, with endless variations on the master’s attempts and Pamela’s near escapes.

Late in the first half, the master, Mr. B., after reading some of her writings, becomes moved by all he has made her suffer. He vows to allow her to return to her parents, then calls her back and his attitude toward her begins to change. Soon they are married, and the book changes into an extended moralistic screed about proper behavior in marriage, obedience, humility, generosity, spiritual virtue erasing worldly hierarchy, etc. etc. Mr. B. slowly gains in respect, Pamela slowly gains in confidence, everyone loves them at last and all is well.

The first crack in my resistance to the book came as I realized that it was revolutionary for Samuel Richardson to write the book of a servant. Not only is she shown throughout to be a human in a dehumanizing situation, she is the one sitting in judgment on everyone else. In the world of mid-eighteenth-century England, this was a startlingly bold act. The reader is invited to see that world through her eyes, to sympathize with her, and to find fault with those placed above her. Mr. B. is constantly claiming his right, his virtue, and his honor while behaving coercively and dishonorably, and we are invited to see that as hypocrisy. Other characters are shown to be wicked to the extent that they do not show Pamela respect. We can be shocked when one squire expresses a broadly accepted sentiment: “Why, what is all this . . . but that our neighbour has a mind to his mother’s waiting-maid! . . . I don’t see any great injury will be done her, he hurts by this.”

The door thus opened, I realized that a book like this was an early salvo in the feminism wars, even though written by a man. Women, despite the constraints placed on them by convention, are presented as rational creatures who think, feel, and fight for a share of freedom. The men standing in their way are despised. And this leveling tendency is extended to class warfare: at one point reference is made to Diogenes, who looked at the bones of Alexander the Great and his slaves and could tell no difference between them—they were equal in God’s sight. Much is made of the idea that Pamela’s devotion to virtue and godliness makes her the equal of anyone, regardless of rank or wealth or even education.

I also found a good deal to interest me in the subtleties of Richardson’s language. Although the bulk of the story is told by Pamela, each character has his or her own dialect and habits of speech and mind. Richardson revised the book continually till he died (the version I read was his final one, published posthumously in 1801), and the notes indicated that in some spots he made the text more vulgar, in others more genteel, as he refined his vision of the characters. There’s a lot of shrewd observation and some comic relief; they are believable humans, not just melodramatic embodiments of villainy or heroism. And at least some of the characters grow and change as the tale progresses, learning from experience.

In short, while the structure of the book may be clumsy, the plot distasteful, it has a lot going on. For fans of Jane Austen, there are enough echoes of familiar scenes to show that she used Richardson’s work as a major source of inspiration, copying some ideas and challenging others, building and refining on the foundation he provided. Like Mr. B., I ended with a good deal of respect for"
Pamela,George,"June 7, 2020",3.0,"An interesting, long epistolary novel (around 500 pages), about the trials and tribulations of virtuous sixteen year old Pamela, who is beautiful, virtuous and perfectly behaved, always. Pamela has been the servant of an elderly rich woman who treated Pamela kindly. Just after the rich woman dies, her son, the Master of the estate, takes a liking to Pamela and tries to seduce her on a number of occasions. The Master is so taken with Pamela that he stops her leaving his property. Pamela begs to leave the Master’s house and return to her poor parents residence. Pamela must deal with being imprisoned in a house against her will and poorly dealt with by the Master’s servants as they had to obey his instructions. Much of the novel is about the struggles and negotiations between Pamela and the Master.

The novel is about the inequalities of status and power. I liked the part when the Master’s sister bursts in on Pamela whilst the Master is away. The sister berates Pamela, showing Pamela not the least bit of respect. The sister asks the servant to bring Pamela to her, stating, “Bid the wench to come down to me.”

I prefer Richardson’s novel, ‘Clarissa’, as there is more wit and clever dialogue between the two main protagonists. ‘Clarissa’ was written some years after ‘Pamela’. However, ‘Clarissa’ is three times longer that ‘Pamela’, being over 1,500 pages!

This book has particular relevance to readers who have an interest in the history of English literature. This book was first published in 1741."
Pamela,A.M.G. ☮Hippie/Fantasia☮,"April 17, 2022",4.0,"Rating: 3.7 / 5

In a way, I suppose it is almost impossible for a modern audience to truly appreciate Pamela--there are simply too many outdated themes and ideals in the story for it to ever be well-received in the 21st century. However, that being said, I do also think that people judge it too harshly, as well.

After all, Samuel Richardson wasn't writing for a 21st century audience--he was writing for the audience of his time and in his social class and, as the book was a best-seller, apparently he succeeded. True, Richardson himself may have been a patriarchal prig, and it's obvious that he doesn't understand what real women are like at all--and, in fact, I don't think any male author can take on an authentic female voice, no more than a female author succeeds at taking on an authentic male voice--but that's seriously besides the point.

The point is that, for its time and in its context, Pamela isn't a bad novel. Sure, it gets rather boring at one point--more specifically, as soon as Mr. B stops being a creeper and Pamela just keeps gushing on and on about how in love she is--but the first volume is pretty good in terms of writing and plot. Sure, I may not agree with a heroine equating her ""Virtue"" as being worth more than her life, and literally going into fits of epilepsy to get away from it, and of course the whole ""marrying your (almost) rapist"" plot is something that no modern-day woman would agree to, but...

BUT.

For its time and in just the writing style alone, I was able to get through it, and by goodness if that isn't worth something for a book so far from my interests!

I'm just saying to cut the author some slack in the appropriate historical context, that's all, and don't have a presentist view--and for those of you who don't know what that is, it's a historian term for those who judge the past by the viewpoints and morals of the present, with the conclusion that it just doesn't work and you can't view history that way."

Young Lord: Wow, you must really be virtuous.
Pamela: Ya think? Woe is me!
Young Lord: Okay, you can go home now.
Young Lord: JK, I want to marry you for real now. I'm sick and can't leave my bed for love of you.
Pamela: What a coincidence! I love you too! But I am so beneath you!

Me:
Pamela: If you marry me, I will spend the rest of my life devoted to you for showing such kindness.
Me:
Young Lord: Let's get married tomorrow.
Pamela: Oh! But as a virtuous maiden, the thought of giving up my virginity fills me with shyness! Let's push it off.

Pamela: And I love you!
Author: I shall now endeavor to tell you what each character means.
Author: * goes into exhaustive description about what moral lesson each character represents *

Me: * *

There. I spared you lots of angst. I know this book represents a turning point in literature and I know I shouldn't expect twenty-first century views of womanhood in a book written in the 1700s but honestly, Pamela was such a pushover! The Young Lord was a jerk! Her romance far too fast!
However, these faults do not belong entirely to 1735, and actually sound a lot like complaints I would make about a modern day romance novel. So I guess some things really do never change.
Two stars in recognition of the mark this book made on literature. But unless you need to read it for school or absolutely love insufferable, self-righteous main characters in unhealthy relationships, spare yourself."
Pamela,Arukiyomi,"November 3, 2015",1.0,"Start to finish: badly-written, moralising drivel. If this book hadn’t been as influential as it had been, this would probably have received my lowest rating. It did however prove inspirational to many in its time. I’m sure the world is a better place for it. Absolutely.

Pamela is a woman who sincerely believes that the best way to resist emotional and sexual abuse from her employer, Mr B., is to believe the best about him. She seems oblivious to the fact that he is an unrepentant predator nor to the fact that by not removing herself from the situation, she contributes to both the cause and result of what must be, oh, three quarters of the novel.

But after being a despicable lecher for most of the book, he suddenly turns over a new leaf and she, dim girl, decides that this is satisfactory and ends up marrying him. They settle down happily and she begins to work on his acquaintances and friends, sorting their debased lives out as well through her pious example. And then, suddenly,

right at the end, just when you think things are going to continue in the same vein they have for over 300 pages, absolutely nothing happens.

Oh, dear. Now I’ve spoiled it for you.

I thought this was a poor book from beginning to end. At the very least, this is misguided rubbish by a man who had absolutely no idea what it was like to be a vulnerable female in a male-dominated society where women’s needs came slightly lower down the scale than those of the family dog. To suggest that women who found themselves subject to compromise from the likes of Mr B., could simply hold fast to their virtue and defeat evil is naive at best and downright dangerous at worst.

And it’s written in the most laborious and over-elaborate style conceivable. Things happen but the whole thing is so drawn out you feel like nothing does. It’s epistolary, which is an entirely pointless structure which I don’t think a single author has ever pulled off to their credit.

So, I’ve read it to save you the bother. Go and find an author who can write a moral tale without sermonising and leave Richardson for lit. buffs to analyse."
Pamela,Alberony Martínez,"April 23, 2021",3.0,"Siendo una de las novelas más influyentes publicada en Gran Bretaña, Pamela o Virtud recompensada, marcó un momento decisivo en el surgimiento de la novela moderna, al punto que su publicación creó dos bandos, los parmelistas y antipamelistas, eclipsando la vida política de la época.
Un texto escrito bajo la forma epistolar, con una trama ajustada y un mensaje didáctico, dieron lugar a que esta forma fuera elogiado, imitados por algunos, pero a la vez surgieron algunos detractores, que llegaron a satirizarla. La hermosa Pamela Andrews, quien a través de esta carta dirigidas a sus padres, nos cuenta como la criada de quince años resiste a los intentos de seducción del acaudalado Mr. B hasta que escarmentado por su virtud, termina casándose. Para la época fue denunciada como pornografía disfrazada, por la larga resistencia de Pamela a los intentos de seducción por parte de su depredador.

Qué vemos en este novela, sino un complejo escenario psicológico, de una que intenta a toda costa no dejarse envolver de los encantamiento de su verdugo, y un verdugo que hace todo lo posible agarrado de las estratagemas psicológica, y con la ayuda del poder, utilizar el abuso para atraerse a Pamela Andrews. Un personaje que hizo todo lo posible para tenerla a su lado, cuando ella creí tener las alas de la libertad, dichas alas estaban siendo hiladas por Mr. B.

Una novela que en momento, claro si nos salimos un poco de la época, vemos a una mujer que aunque quiera relatar su virtud, hay momentos que nos preguntamos, y que mujer es esta tan floja, que en un sin numero de ocasiones quiso escapar del secuestro al que estaba sometido, pero el astuto Mr.B siempre tenia un as bajo la manga, terminaba en caer en su circulo. Los repetidos intentos de seducción del maestro enamorado -enfocados una y otra vez por la criada ingeniosa, condujeron al secuestro y encarcelamiento, en este circulo epistolar. Las ambiguedades de la novela es la que la hacen bestseller de la ficcion inglesa, como dije anteriormente, por un parte promueve un manual de comportamiento, pero por otra parte es ponografia encubierta."
Pamela,Rachel M.,"October 26, 2014",1.0,"Man, reading this book for 18th century literature was like a bad hangover except with no booze involved - just a headache. It was so very very long and so very very bad. I had to skim through the last half of the book, because I couldn't be bothered to give a damn.

The main character Pamela irritated me to death. Her virtue is her defining point and while I understand that morals and sexuality were VERY different in the 1700s, I didn't want to sit there and read page after page about a servant girl protecting her virtue from her CREEPY employer. The parody take on her (Shamela) was much more entertaining.

And don't even get me started on Mr. B. I wanted to throttle him and thrust a chastity belt in his face. This isn't to say I don't enjoy morally ambiguous characters (""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of my favorite novels ever and we all know how sweet Alex is), but Mr. B and Pamela felt so flat to me. A cardboard box has more personality.

Of course, being forced to read this book for class and then being told repeatedly that it was the Greatest Thing Ever probably had a negative impact on my overall opinion. *sigh* Thank you, dear professor!"
Pamela,Bee,"June 23, 2017",1.0,I highlighted every instance of emotionally manipulative behaviour on Mr. B's part. This was just horrendous. I honestly can't wait to talk about it in seminars because I this was not romantic one bit.
Pamela,M.M. Strawberry Library & Reviews,"May 22, 2020",2.0,"Haha. Oh man, oh wow. I read this book right after reading Moll Flanders, so as far as the writing style went, Pamela wasn't a challenge.

The story and subject matter on the other hand... this book was said to cause an uproar over its publication because some saw it as porn, etc etc. Well, Mr. B does attempt to rape Pamela, so... Yeah, you heard right. Anyway.

Pamela starts out as the virtuous maid of a recently-deceased lady. She is 15 at this time and has been in employ in the house for over 3 years now and the lady had given Pamela an education, introducing her to literature, music, etc. She passes away, leaving Pamela in the employ of her son, who is nowhere near as altruistic as his mother and tries to seduce her. Pamela holds fast to her virtue (because how else would she be rewarded?)

She continues to rebuff him to the point where the other servants have taken notice, and try to assist her in what way they can without rousing the master's ire. It culminates in the master kidnapping Pamela to his country estate in hopes of wearing her down and making her give up her virtue. Among her trials are a housekeeper who constantly watches her and even hits her, a thug hired to scare her straight, and an attempted rape in which said housekeeper was complicit.

Pamela is pretty much a Mary Sue. She is beautiful, virtuous, charming, clever, and despite her poor background, has the grace of a lady. Her would-be haters are soon enough won over by her sweetness and virtue, and even Mr. B, that roguish dastard, is so awed by her determined virtue that he declares he no longer wants her as mistress, but as wife. She completely forgives all the wrongs that were committed towards her, even the physical abuse from Mr. B's maid, and the attempted rape itself. She is constantly falling to her knees to pray to God and thank him for her blessings, and what an unworthy creature of Mr. B she is (yes, an unworthy creature to her would-be rapist!) Seriously, after she agreed to marry Mr. B it felt like she was falling to her knees and thanking Mr. B for his generosity and kindness, or thanking God for the same every other page.

500 pages of this. 500 freaking pages. The first half was all like...
Mr. B. ""I want you.""
Pamela ""No.""
Mr. B. ""Yes.""
Pamela ""No. Muh virtue!!!!!!!!""
Mr. B. ""You sauce-box! You slut! You creature! You bold-face!""
Pamela ""MUH VIRTUE!!!111!!!!!one!!!!11!!!""
Mr. B. ""So? I'll pay you for it.""
Pamela ""No! My virtue is not for sale!""
Mr. B ""Bold-face! Sauce-box! Creature! Hussy! Slut! Slattern! Silly girl/child!!! GIVE IT TO ME!!! Y WONT U GIVE IT TO ME!!! I AM SO ANGRY WITH U!!!"" (let's keep in mind that it's Pamela who has every right to be angry here, yet she still won't BE angry. Just frightened, whining, crying, and fainting)

Then comes the scene of the attempted rape, where Pamela throws such a swooning/fainting/hysterical fit that it actually gives Mr. B pause. Thank goodness.

Then the second half of this book was like...
Mr. B. ""You are such a sweet creature, and I humbly repent of all my sins!""
Pamela ""Oh you are too kind, master, I am such an unworthy creature!""
Mr. B. ""You are an angel, and have reformed me of my rakish ways. My love for you is undying. Be my wife!""
Pamela ""Thank you, God, for rewarding my virtue!""

Sigh. At least the author does recognize the double standard of a man being able to fool around with little or no consequences, where naturally, the same usually could not be said of the woman. However, he could have told a much better (and shorter) story than Pamela.

One thing that really bothered me about this book was the implication that Pamela's father would have disowned her if she had given up her virginity to Mr. B. Regardless of the fact that Pamela kept telling her father (via letters) how frightened she was, how she was praying to God, how she was fighting for her virtue, etc etc. That was one thing that really decided me against the book, I MIGHT have given this book 3 stars because hey, this IS a old book and gender norms were different back then, but this over-emphasis on Pamela's virginity (and that of women overall) really grated on me."
Pamela,Gisela Hafezparast,"September 17, 2016",4.0,"Probably more a 3.5
I listened to this book through Audible and I think this suits this book very well. Like all of Richardson's books this has been written in monthly installments like many 18th Century books and just like Clarissa (which I loved) most of it is written in letter form, which makes it very entertaining.

The book is basically exactly what it says on the cover. It is all about virtue rewarded, although with 21st Century eyes it looks very unlikely and I am sure it did so to many 18th century eyes. Moreover, I had to remind myself constantly especially in the second half of the book that this is an 18th Century novel with 18th Century values and views about women and their role as well as that of ""Masters"" and Servants. If you don't do that, the story is really hard to take and my feminist and socialist side was very often outraged at the role of the ""Master"" could get away with just because he was first Pamela's Master to her being his servant and then as her Master to her being his wife.

Basically it is the story of a rich, spoiled rake trying to seduce his dead mother's chamber maid and not being in the least scrupulous to use all his power and money for this end. The virtuous and at least in the first half of the book, very clever Pamela however, manages to save her virtue and even converts his lust into love by rejecting him time and time again, including his offers to basically buy her favours. Moreover, through clever ploys and very well timed fainting fits she even stops him several times from raping her. The conversion from lover to husband, i.e. from wanna be seducer and rapist to lover and loving husband is, I am sure, even for 18th century readers, difficult to buy, although it is very entertaining.

What I found interesting is that Samuelson clearly still felt that a rich master marrying his servant because of her outstanding beauty and virtue would make his upper class society also to accept this marriage, as happens in the book. I am sure a Victorian writer, would have not felt the same way. If he is right, the boundaries of what a rich man could do were still more fluent. And Samuelson should know, by all accounts he was quite a rake himself and stopped at not much.

The conversion from clever maiden fighting for her virtue, frightened and disgusted by her Master to loving wife was difficult to believe. Her slavish, gratefulness and that of everyone around the Master however, only sounded too true and reminds me very much of what many a rich mans trophy wife might even experience these days.

The book also shows the 100% dependency of servants on their master. The book shows that this single man because of his standing in society and his money can destroy almost anybody who is ""beneath him"" and especially those financially dependent on him whenever he feels like it. The master treats most of his servants appallingly and some do his dirty work despite their better natures, whilst others are being encouraged by him to show their worst. He has total power and only his will counts and when he ""forgives"" them, they have to be grateful and clearly nobody thought anything wrong in that.

At the end of the book Samuelson explains to his readers the morals of the story and how various people should take it as a lesson. I am sorry, I am sure there has been many an 18th Century women who at this point was very tempted to throw the book against the wall.

Despite all this the book, like Clarissa, is extremely well written, the language beautiful, it's twist and turns never fail to amuse and sometimes you hold your breath because you fear for Pamela and others so much. Therefore, to anybody who can suspend their modern self and who loves classic literature, I would very much recommend this book. It is very entertaining for sure."

Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber: The Katya Livingston Chronicles,Ash,"January 15, 2013",5.0,"The reason I decided to read Confessions of a Sociopath Social Climber is because I saw the horrible movie starring Jennifer Love Hewitt last year. I liked the character before she (SPOILER ALERT) gained a heart and became noble. I liked the idea so I wanted to read the book. If I was Adele Lang, I would sue everyone involved with the movie.

The book is absolutely hilarious! It's a year in the life of Katya Livingston. It starts off a journal that Katya has to write in order to keep attract of her outrageous spending. Then because a weekly column for a small newspaper. The best thing is that Katya learns nothing! Not even when she becomes the ""victim"" of scathing but true biography on herself.

Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber: The Katya Livingston Chronicles,Brittany,"December 30, 2009",1.0,"How I Came To Read This Book: My mom had it and I snagged it – bright cover + tiara = yes.

The Plot / Good & Bad: I can’t even separate the two in this case, so I’m combining the plot & good/bad about this book in one. To call the main character, Katya, a sociopath, is not an understatement. This is possibly one of the most despicable protagonists I’ve ever read about. In theory the book is supposed to function as anti-chick lit, with Katya as a take no prisoners social climbing psycho who functions like one of those robots with a little checklist of characteristics she immediately processes upon engaging with someone in terms of how far they can help her progress forward. Unfortunately, she doesn’t do this in an amusingly sarcastic way, instead she’s literally deranged and sardonic – taking joy in other people’s misery. The writing is brutal, the humour is DOA, and again, horrible characters all around.

The Bottom Line: You’d have to be a sociopath to read this book.

Anything Memorable?: I get this book and Plum Sykes’ “Bergdorf Blondes” confused – this is the nastier, even more vacant version of the former.

50-Book Challenge?: Nope"
Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber: The Katya Livingston Chronicles,Alexis,"January 17, 2014",5.0,"There are no words for the humor, brilliance, and absolute faultiness of this book.

Yes, faultiness --not to be confused with the much more subjective faultlessness.

Katya Livingston is the most self-centered, detestable, materialistic and ruthless female protagonist since Scarlett O'Hara . . . and also the most entertaining!

I saw the Lifetime movie starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, and it doesn't even compare to the unabashed and uncensored wit of this novel.

Adele Lang (excuse my exclusion of the grave accent mark--but its validity is decidedly questionable in nature) is a bona fide genius, and her enigmatic and carefully crafted persona (excuse, me, ) is a refreshing change from the goody-too-shoes seductresses a la Mainstream Culture.

This book was chosen as the second Kelly Ripa Book Club selection, as she was looking for fun summer books. Not great literature, but a fantastic way to while away an afternoon. Katya is an anti-Bridget Jones. She's a drunk bitch swanning around London, killing her friends' dogs and stealing their jobs. While you do have to wonder why her friends are friends with her, the lovely schadenfreude will help you overlook that. Plus, you've seen it: horrible people do in fact somehow have friends most of the time. Inexplicable perhaps, but there are always pathetic hangers-on. If you want to feel better about your job, your love life, your budget, Katya will do the trick in short order."
Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber: The Katya Livingston Chronicles,Christy,"January 11, 2019",5.0,"I loved this book! This is the type of book where you root for the bad guy and don't feel the least bit bad about it.

Katya is truly a sociopath. Narcissistic, unyielding, delusional and completely without a shred of moral fiber, she hacks and slashes her way to becoming a society darling and though she never makes it, you'll never convince her that she didn't.

I imagine Katya as Patsy from the show ""Absolutely Fabulous"". A social climbing nitwit who cannot see that she isn't fabulous at all.

This is one of my favorite books. No joke. It feels like a fluffy book but it's actually a brilliant spoof of books like Bridget Jones's Diary.

Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber: The Katya Livingston Chronicles,JennaK,"January 19, 2009",2.0,"Katya Livingston is not meant to be a person you fall in love with. On the contrary, she is person you find yourself quickly falling in hate with. Not even her friends are relatable, as most of them are similar (though less self-confident) versions of Katya herself. Although there were some moments where I found myself chuckling to myself, the book is a bit hard to read as Katya and her co-stars are next to impossible to relate to. Some of her complaints are valid (such as when her friend, Angel, changes her three-month-old daughter's diaper on the table in a Pizza Hut), but many are ridiculous, and watching Katya come up with more and more excuses to explain away her pathetic life just didn't do it for me.

Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber: The Katya Livingston Chronicles,Tania,"August 17, 2011",1.0,"I won't spend too much time recapping the plot, because others have done it, and really, it's a thin plot to begin with. It's just basically the story of the life of Katya. She is the ultimate narcissist, who treats everyone around her like crap. I thought the premise was amusing, as it seemed like it would be a good satire on the whole ""Bridget Jones"" thing. I did find the book engrossing when I started it; there is no doubt that the author has some writing skills. The pace is good, some of the jokes are funny, and the intelligence of the author (and the lead character, really - Katya's intelligence is about her only redeeming quality) do shine through. Some of the subplots - i.e. the foster child, Katya as birth coach, and a few other things, as gags. The book could be a good outlet for the reader's dark side. It just doesn't work in the end.

What's wrong with it? Katya is just someone I couldn't relate to at all. She's completely one dimensional. All the characters, in fact, are paper thin. Lang makes the mistake of thinking that satirical and stereotypical are synonymous. They aren't. In fact, the satire would've been even more pointed had the book been more well rounded. It also doesn't help that the situations in the book are just that - situations. There is really very little in the way of an ongoing story. Even the bits that worked, mentioned above, don't mesh together well enough to form a real story. The diary format also doesn't work here. What Lang is striving for - a good satire of the whole `Bridget' genre - is more effectively accomplished in Slave to Fashion. I'd suggest you just read that instead."
Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber: The Katya Livingston Chronicles,Melissa Lee-Tammeus,"September 29, 2013",2.0,"I am on this kick about learning about deviant and sociopathic behaviors, so much so that I thought this lighter fictional look at it would be a nice change other than all the textbooks I've been reading. It was cute for about the first 20 pages and then, good grief, it got old really fast. Yes, there is no doubt that Katya, the main character, is a sociopath. She is heartless and cruel yet can charm her way into jobs, professions she knows nothing about, and free everything all the time. She takes advantage of everyone and everything and is quite clueless to the mess she leaves behind. The story is told through Katya's journal in which she is supposed to be keeping track of her finances for her taxes. It quickly becomes a rant about all things ""wrong"" in her life. I think the author does a great job at showing the true behaviors of a sociopath, but like any normal person dealing with someone with these tendencies, 20 pages is probably about all anyone can take. So, maybe the author did too good of a job depicting this character, because I just wanted to be done with this book."

It's almost like the narrator is the illegitimate love child of the ""cool mom"" from Mean Girls and the ""intelligent prisoner"" from In Living Color . The narration bounced from trying to sound hip to inappropriately placed multisyllabic words. When you add in the constant run-on sentences (I counted one with over 75 words and then another of almost 50 words in the very next paragraph - and that was in the first chapter alone), this book is very difficult to understand.
If I were to offer any constructive criticism to the author it would be to learn to restrain your narrative. Sometimes less is more. When you write a book, there is no need to use every single word you know. Some of the best authors in the history are that because they're writing is elegantly simple.
I, initially, was not able to make it past the first chapter, but I decided to give it another go, in order to be fair to the author. I ended up DNFing it after 5 chapters."
Suicide Ride: The Platinum Man,"JustJen ""Miss Conduct""","February 6, 2014",3.0,"A review by The Blogger Girls.

There has been an awful lot of hype surrounding this book, which, I’ll be honest, is the main reason I decided to give it a go. I don’t think I found any reviews helpful to really understanding what this story was about, which was a bit disappointing. I truly wanted to know something about what made it such a fantastic and crazy ride.

To start with, the writing itself blew me away, although not always in a good way. The descriptions are amazing and beautiful, but I often struggled to keep up with what was actually going on. Often I felt as though I missed the important details because I got lost in the descriptive wording. So, while it was beautiful and poetic, it left me feeling confused at times.

As for the story, we have Johnny Gellis, a man somewhat on the run from his life as a gynecologist, abruptly leaving everything behind but his beat up classic car and his guitars. He heads to LA to be a rock star because he has this amazing talent and incredible look. Right from the beginning I was longing for the details behind these events. He is staunchly straight, and quite the lady killer (maybe that’s closer to the truth than I realize? I don’t know). Anyway, he ends up learning about retired record mogul Norman Dimond and where he can be found, at his raunchy gay club.

Being desperate to become a rock star, he seeks Dimond, knowing full well what may be in store. I was very excited for their interactions, and longed to finally have some dialog to sink my teeth into. While we did get some of that, I was a little disappointed in the long run. The more I learned about Norman Dimond, the more he creeped me out, to the point that there was very little about him that I liked. Thankfully, Johnny doesn’t just bend over for Norman, but the whole situation was just creepy and strange. Speaking of creepy and strange, Norman’s manservant, Cullum, was a bit of a mystery. First I thought he was alright, but then his actions spoke quite differently. And then there is poor Drew, Norman’s current boy toy. I felt so bad for the poor guy throughout this entire story.

So basically, Johnny is an extremely hot package (which Dimond constantly tells Johnny in more ways than one), and Norman wants him, in a bad way. They finally come to an agreement which is again quite odd, but they seem to finally be somewhat on the same page. Norman is trying to find out the background on Johnny, as Johnny isn’t giving anything up in this area either. Now, just when I thought things were ironing themselves out, Johnny does a 180.

This last part of the book was the best part for me. It became less wordy with more action. I was still left with so many questions, though I truly wondered if I had missed some of the answers earlier on. There is a sequel that just came out, and I will probably read it just to find out what happened next. Unfortunately, this story is going to be told over quite a few books, so I’m not sure if I’ll be able to hang on for the entire ride.

I really believe this may be a case of it’s not you, it’s me, so if you’re looking for something different, without any real romance or relationship, but with a lot of mystery and shadiness going on, please give this a try, because I’m definitely in the minority on this one. The writing is fabulous, but the story was just too wordy and confusing for my total enjoyment."

I bought this book after seeing it advertised, a lot, on many Facebook threads. I like cars and I love a good romance (and I'm gay, so my go-to is M/M romance). I was so attracted by the car, even though my husband laughed at me when I bought the book because of the cover.
I now have a very pretty cover on my Kindle app. For those of you who have read my other reviews, you know how much I detest leaving any book unfinished. I read, on average, about 10-12 books a week and I read them all through to the end. It can take longer to get around to writing the review, but I do love me some good reads.
I also like words. Gosh, I adore long convoluted sentences and turns of phrase that leave me with a grin on my face. Metaphor? Hey - throw me some lovely metaphors, add a spoonful of similes and I'm good to go!
Until now. I have read and re-read the opening 10% of this book repeatedly and ended doubting my own IQ. Am I stupid, because I can't understand a thing? I bought the 'revised' edition, but I was drowning in a sea of prose with no hope of swimming to shore. Nothing seemed to sink in and what did penetrate my brain was immediately forgotten. It was the weirdest experience I have had in a while; nothing like this has ever happened.
I'm upset I have to 1 star this book. I wanted to like it, especially after reading these comments and reviews. I could cry for the author, because there are some people who just seem to delight in bringing her down when she should be advised and built up. I'm tempted to list some brilliant writing groups, so she can learn an art she so plainly loves, but having no real idea of where in the world she is, it's a bit impractical to offer.
This is, I am afraid to say, the second book out of the 1281 I have read in 2014 that I have had to give up on and leave unfinished. It was a prosaic journey through insipidity, tangled up with some out-of-context long words and metaphors that just drowned under the weight of the author's aspirations.
Sorry."

Suicide Ride: The Platinum Man,Faith Gibson,"November 3, 2013",5.0,"Ready for the 2nd Chorus

This book is described as a noir, think L.A. Confidential only in the record business. the author uses lots of song lyrics or titles, adds a lot of musicians and musical terminology, all written in a smooth yet in your face way that makes it sound like you are listening to an old scat musician. the two main characters are Johnny, a young doctor running from his life in Atlanta (finally eludes to why he is running toward the end) to LA to pursue his music career and an older record label owner, Norman, who wants Johnny. Johnny is a very straight heterosexual male who doesn't want anything to do with sex with another man. This isn't one of the stories where the two men hop right into bed with the hetero figuring out he is a closet gay. this is Johnny who has emotional issues and self medicates, who is still very straight trying to figure out how far he'll go to get his record deal. you pull for Johnny. he has a big old 10 incher and he loathes it. says there's nothing uglier. then you almost hate Norman who is the same age as Johnny's dad. Norman isn't really a nice man. He is a big deal who is used to getting what or who he wants with little regard to the other person. Johnny pursues Norman to get the record deal, but after one meeting, Norman is the one hooked and begins his pursual of Johnny. There is sex. It's isn't the loving sex between two men in love, but raw, rough brutal sex. This book is intense, but the wordsmithing brings it back to a less than hardcore level with all the rock jargon. I am hooked. I can't wait for the next two books"

Suicide Ride: The Platinum Man,Carolyn Giddens,"October 20, 2013",5.0,"Elizabeth Llewellyn's debut novel, Suicide Ride, does anything but disappoint! The suicide ride begins the moment you set foot in the black Corvette, and it does not let up but leaves you hanging on through the twists and turns of Johnny Gellis's life.
Gellis is all man and then some when his path crosses Norman Diamond's, a bi-sexual with eyes for Johnny, and when these two pair of eyes meet, there is fire. Gellis appears on the current Hollywood scene like William Holden in Sunset Boulevard, broke, desperate, and vulnerable, and Norman is not afraid to use Johnny's vulnerability. Fortunately, we get to see much more of Johnny than we did of Bill Holden with the author's provocative twist on the old Hollywood story of the director's couch. In this story, though, the characters are fresh and alive with passion and feeling, and Llewellyn develops them brilliantly as the story drives us hard and fast.
One of the striking differences in this gay/bi-sexual genre is the literary merit of the story telling. You love the characters because you know Llewellyn does, as you watch their lives spin out of control, and you feel out of control as you volunteer for this ride. You want to despise them at a point, but suddenly, Llewellyn masterfully evokes a beautiful sympathy for these two lonely people with pasts that makes the word ""dysfunctional"" ashamed of itself.
The plot development is controlled with no lose wheels driving about through the pages. The twists become harrowing just as the turns that Johnny takes in that Corvette. The writer wonderfully combines the plot development with the character development in this breath-taking ride.
The sub-plots deserve praise as well. We learn about the psyche's of these two men caught in one of the oldest stories known to man, love and desire over obedience and submission. It's the forbidden fruit we crave that we know we must not eat, and Llewellyn's first book leaves us wanting more!
Kudos to Elizabeth Llewellyn for doing something fresh and new: a combination of the literary with erotica!"

Suicide Ride: The Platinum Man,Kazy,"February 27, 2014",5.0,"I am at an amusement park, standing in front of an enormous roller coaster called ""Suicide Ride"". I hear the screams and gasps coming from the other riders as the coaster cars fly by overhead. Those exiting the ride have expressions of dazed amusement, and they turn and run back to the entrance to have another go, singing the ride's praises. So I look at the complex scramble of hills, valleys and twists and wonder, ""Can I handle this?""

The reviews for the ride have been so phenomenal I figure, why not? So I take the plunge. Right away, I am plunked down into a coaster car shaped like an old Vette. The walls around me display so vividly the atmosphere of the Sunset Strip that I forget the piles of snow at home. I am in L.A. The ride operator smiles wryly, yanks my seatbelt tight and says, ""Hang on.""

And hang on I do, for the entire, thrilling, ride. Honestly, that first hill takes a long, long time, at least it seems so to me, but then I reach the crest and get just a glimpse of all of the twists and turns coming before I am plunged head-first into a thrill-a-second trip into Johnny Gellis' journey of self-discovery at the hands of Norman Dimond. And what hands they are...

My head is jolted from side to side, my stomach rises and falls, but I can't get enough. I can't wait to see what the last turn will bring, but at the same time, I don't want it to come. The ride's just too damn fun. All good things end, though, so as the brakes squeal to a stop, I reluctantly release my belt and stand on wobbly legs. I follow all the other dazed trippers toward the ""EXIT"" sign.

Once outside, I think about riding again, just to make sure that there's nothing I missed. Then I glance to my left and see a sign for a new attraction: SUICIDE RIDE 2 - The Fix. Should I try it? Can my over-worked mind stand another psychotic trip with Johnny and Norman? Can my heart take the highs and lows and turns without combusting? Maybe. Maybe not. But it's an addiction now. I turn left and join the line."

Suicide Ride: The Platinum Man,Kimberly,"January 2, 2015",,"After all the reviews I've seen on here and Amazon, I was a bit hesitant to leave a review. But after trying to read this book, not even making it past the first chapter, and returning it for a refund, something I really try never to do, I decided to bite the bullet. I'm not going to rate a DNF book. Here goes....

I'm no expert on writing. As an author myself with 20 yrs. in the biz, we all have those who don't get our work. It happens. However, after really trying to digest this story, the purple prose, over the top descriptive narration, and confusing tangents left me wondering what the hell I had just read. And that was in the first chapter alone. I can understand wanting to give the reader some meat to chew on, but too much can choke.

The premise is a good one, but take all the fluff, purple prose, unnecessary description, and running tangents out, the story would be readable and even passably good. As is, it's too much to slog through everything to get to gist of the story."
Suicide Ride: The Platinum Man,Penny,"March 6, 2014",,"A friend of a friend told me I had to read this book. That is was just the most well-written book that she had read in such a long time.

I told her about my reluctance to read it. It was not well reviewed on multiple sites, and individuals I trusted gave it unfavorable account.

She told me it was almost ""lyrical"". I should at least give it a read. And she loaned it to me.

So I told myself to keep an open mind and in the beginning I thought this is written differently. It reminded me of a Dark Noir films from the 40's, but after a while the newness wore off. There were beautifully written prose, but with what purpose. After a while, it just became too much with seemly little storyline. I stopped caring and I put down the book.

So since I didn't finish the book I don't feel comfortable rating it."
Suicide Ride: The Platinum Man,Peter Maughan,"October 11, 2013",5.0,"Fasten Your Seatbelt. Peter Maughan

A ride on the edge of the seat. Adamantine prose on a full tank under the bright lights. High octane writing that takes off from Hollywood with its foot down, and which Llewellyn sends, burning rubber, screeching round the bends and tight corners of a plot and sub-plots that will keep you up long after you should have gone to sleep, a live wire of a book you know you should put down but cannot, not yet, let go. A book fizzing with descriptive energy and peopled with characters who come off the page, and who the author, with scalpel precision, takes tenderly apart layer by layer and shows us their beating hearts. Eliciting, from this reader at any rate, an understanding and sympathy I would not have thought possible at the start of the ride."

Suicide Ride: The Platinum Man,Romance Readers Retreat,"January 18, 2014",4.0,"This book is superbly written and a testament to the sheer intelligence of its author. I was blown away by the writing style, it is musical and poetic in its flow.
Although it did take me a short while to get in to it, as it is written in a way so completely different to any other book I've ever read, once I had acclimatized to it, I thoroughly enjoyed it and came to appreciate the author's lyricism and talent of weaving words together.
As for the story, my advice to you would be, strap yourselves in for the ride, the ending will leave you wanting more"

Suicide Ride: The Platinum Man,Jennifer Greeff,"October 1, 2014",4.0,"Man, what can I say. I read this story a couple months ago and I'm still speechless. This book was just so different from anything I've ever read. It's Film Noire meets M/M Romance and its incredible. It's gritty, raw and absolutely nuts, but that's what made it so fun to read.

Johnny Gellis has escaped Atlanta, GA, fleeing a life he desperately needed to get away from. He's headed West, to the land of surf and sunshine, Los Angeles, CA. But its not the surf he's in need of, it's music. He wants to land himself a record deal and strike it big in Hollywood. But to do that he's going to need connections and that connection is Norman Dimond.

Norman Dimond is successful, eclectic, he can make your dreams come true. He's got a record label but to get to him Johnny has to enter his inner sanctum, a Gay club. Johnny is as straight as they come, he feasts on the flesh of the female variety and as often as possible. Meeting a Gay man is not his idea of a good time but Johnny would do just about anything to get this record deal. Norman is taken with Johnny the second he meets with him but he won't be taken advantage of by this young, straight kid living in some cheap flea bag motel. Norman is looking for a new play thing, but more importantly he's looking to be the Daddy to a true partner. Yes, Dimond wants the man that can finally be by his side. He's grown tired of all of his play things and Johnny with the face of a model, the body of a god and the voice of an angel, Dimond can't get enough.

Watching Dimond try to break Johnny down and get to him anyway that he can is both entertaining and original. The story is fresh and I had a blast reading this game of cat and mouse. There's not a ton of sexual encounters in this installment but what you do get is HOT and yes sometimes a little disturbing. My biggest gripe about the story is in the writing. E. Llewellyn is a masterful story teller but she's wordy and a lot of the time, I felt like the use of words from the thesaurus was over the top. That's not to say she did it in a ""look at me, trying to be too smart, look at the words I can use here"", kind of way. No, Llewellyn is just that intelligent and can string these things together but I did find myself skipping through whole sections of text to keep the story pace flowing. The darkness inside Johnny was wonderfully captured and portrayed on the page. The loneliness inside Dimond is felt in every word. The emotions inside them and the struggle Johnny goes through to come to terms with what Dimond is offering will have you flipping the pages to read this truly original novel. All of this gets Llewellyn a 4 bar review from this girl and I can't wait to finish The Fix (Book 2) and give you my thoughts! Grab your copy of The Platinum Man today!"
The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Cathy Dark,"March 25, 2010",1.0,"This is a poorly written self published book. I normally wouldn’t even bother to waste time writing a review about it, since it is just a self published book pretending to be greater than it is. However I’m angry that I was tricked into buying this crap.

This book is not a “modern day fantasy classic”. It is not “better than Harry Potter” or “Star Wars with elves”. Robert Stanek is not “America’s Tolkien”. Where did all this over-the-top hype come from? One can only guess (or risk censor from this site)

This book is full of stale, poorly descriptive writng. A short boring episode of what threatens to be some endless drawn out cliché (there are books 2, 3, 4 and then a “sequel series” (?) that goes on and on). This book is so unimaginative that there is even a “dark lord” and a “middle earth” thrown into the mix.

However, this book does have some unintentional funny bits. I had to laugh when I was told that “middle earth” was a realm between lower and upper earth. And the author clearly is confused about the meaning of many words, such as when a frightened princess speaks COYLY to a supernatural apparition.

I would suggest reading the 1st chapter on the Amazon preview feature - or doing an internet search on the author - before buying or getting this book."
The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Tyson,"January 6, 2013",1.0,"My review here.

Or read it here:

The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches has been compared to JRR Tolkien and for good reason, they both contain magic, elves. and evil newly awakened. There are also words, sentences, paragraphs, and chapters in both books. So, I can completely understand why you would want to draw comparisons to both novels; however, once you get past those details the comparison quickly falls apart. We have three main characters: the young princess, an elf who believes duty comes before dishonor, and a young boy with magical powers. Each one of these characters have the emotional range of a sofa pillow and are as three dimensional as a sheet of paper. The book is targeted for young adults but I can not see anyone of any age finding this novel entertaining. Painting by numbers has more mystery and intrigue than what I found in this book. The characters are dreadful and most of that is due to the dialogue.

There are many passages in The Kingdoms and of the Elves of Reach that had me dumbfounded. I literally found myself shaking my head and re-reading portions of the book and then laughing out loud at some of the alliterations and illusions Stanek attempted to convey to the readers. I usually refrain from using book quotes in my reviews, but in this case I will make an exception.

“Always more reminders of the things she should or should not do—her proper place, always her proper place. She knew all about the proper things, the proper mannerisms, the proper greetings, her proper duties, her proper place. She had even been taught, though only recently, the proper things to do to invite a man’s attention. She was to begin courting. But why? “

Or this winning prose:

“But his search was in vain because he truly was alone. There was no one else with him.”

And the best for last:

""The robed figure lowered his hood to reveal childlike features riddled with lines that spoke of ages past and of hardship.""

These are just a few of my favorites from a book riddled with absurd statements. It is as if he wrote the book and then went back to it with the express purpose of adding as many words that he knew from the thesaurus and placed them sporadically within the text. The book is full of awkward sentences and repetitive descriptions. It helped make it a little more tolerable to read but only from a comical standpoint.

At the heart of The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches are three people questing to defeat an unspeakable evil that is returning to the world. Sure Tolkien did it, but so have many other authors, all of which did it much better than Mr. Stanek. The book, while not hard to read, suffers from a very unimaginative individual.

I really tried to read this novel with an open mind and do my best to avoid the negative reactions from other reviewers and disappointed consumers but after finishing this dreadful debacle of a book, I found myself in the exact same spot as others. I have to warn you to stay away from The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches and any other book written by Robert Stanek. My recommendation is to avoid this at all costs unless death is the only other option, although death may be the better option.

The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Evan,"May 8, 2013",1.0,"Dear Robert Stanek,
Your books are garbage. I find it quite comical that you would go to such lengths to make yourself look like a good author. Let's face it, you are not. This book was so bad. Just terrible really. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BOOK OR THIS AUTHOR! Also, I find it funny that the only people that like your books have no profile pictures and the only books that they have ever reviewed are YOUR books.
Its almost as if YOU wrote those reviews yourself. Oh wait...YOU DID!
These books had a weak plot and weak characters. Do not waste your money. Robert Stanek, your books are a disease.

The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Zong,"August 19, 2011",1.0,This book really shat on my soul.
The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Allison,"October 26, 2012",1.0,"I got this back in my early days of trying to find decent new fantasy to read after Tolkien, Jordan, and Brooks, and the 5-star reviews led me to believe that this was going to be real quality fantasy on a par with Tolkien himself. Unfortunately, it is not, and instead I was often - baffled. The writing is contradictory and confusing, and I found myself re-reading passages to try to visualize what was going on, but then giving up and pressing on just to finish.

The reason I continued reading the series is that I was foolish enough to order them all at once instead of waiting to see if I liked the first one, and I was also foolish enough to hope they'd get better. I read four books from this author and instead of feeling like I at least got my money's worth, I just felt like I wasted a bunch of time as well as money.

The rave reviews are why I hoped it would get better, thinking it must be me and everything would click into place at some point. Unfortunately it never happened and I was extremely disappointed not to have discovered 'the next Tolkien.' The writing is too confusing, and the story fails to meet its potential.

It's a shame, but I did try, and I read all four books with an open mind. I am not just bashing the author out of spite. Reviews are opinions, and I feel that other readers should be able to consider my opinion as they choose whether or not to read any book. I really don't mind if someone disagrees with me - if you enjoyed the books, I am happy for you. I honestly couldn't."
The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,BookGreed,"May 21, 2013",1.0,"The only thing worse than this book is Robert Stanek's behavior. I admit to being late in knowing about the Stanek fraud. I was nice about asking him on FaceBook about not being able to leave a review. He then comes back with an attack on another author that I keep up with on FB. I DO happen to like more than 1 author. Here's my conversation with Stanek:
Elia:
""I've asked a couple of times but my comments never shown up. I was wondering why I can't post a review of one of your books on Amazon? Has it been disabled? Thanks.""
Robert Stanek:
""Stacy Avary aka Anastacia Kelley should probably see a psychiatrist. If you're her friend maybe you can convince her to start taking her medication. Good luck with that!""
Elia:
""Umm, what does she have to do with your books? I have more friends than just her. I don't know why you're being so nasty. She is an author. Is that why you're bitter towards her? Yes, I love 'Nightfall"". I can love more than one book, you know. I'll review your book elsewhere but I will make a note of you acting jealous.""
My guess is that he attacked this author because she was the 1st one he saw. I'm sure it's jealousy because she has legit reviewers honestly liking her work. I've never seen such terrible behavior before. In all honesty, his books are not and will never be as well-written as Kelley's. She has already written circles around him.
Stanek's book is so poorly written, I feel more like I'm reading gibberish than a supposed great book. The story is choppy; the scenes jump uncomfortably from 1 scene to the next that no one can follow. He should not be comparing his book to Tolkien. He should not think he's a better writer than Anastacia Kelley or any author out there. Stanek is one of the worst writers ever. After reading about the fraud, I was shocked how far he went to make himself look like a best seller. I'm positive those 5 stars are sock puppets. Pathetic."
The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Alexandra,"January 22, 2015",1.0,"Don't believe the hype. This book has not been recommended as claimed in the blurb. It is not a best seller. It has not won awards. It is amateur garbage that has been slickly marketed. It also is not appropriate for children.

In addition the narrator on the version sold through Audible is horrendous.

Do your due diligence before purchasing this one.

My advice: Don't waste any money or any time on this one. There is no one who would honestly and truthfully believe this trash is a great story.

There are however critiques of it on the web that are pretty entertaining. Find one of those instead if you really want to know what this book is all about.

I recommend this one:"

Update: The book never really got any better. Neither my son or I liked it. I would describe it the audio book as the auditory equivalent of ""watching paint dry."" Part of it has to do with the narrator (who was very flat), but the biggest problem is that very little of interest goes on in the book and much of it seems to be setting up bigger to take place in later books - too bad because I don't have the time or desire to follow up with later books in the series in the vague hope that it will get better."

The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,sologdin,"February 15, 2015",1.0,"I’m all for self-published authors, so it’s not really politically or aesthetically pleasant for me to beat up on a guy who’s just trying to make it. That said, this text could really use an editor, which is one of the virtues of the conventional agent/editor/publisher/ marketer process. Suffice to state that this text warrants a ’revise & resubmit’ response. (We need not feel too guilty in responding negatively here, though, as author apparently has had some bona fide success as a writer of non-fictional computer machine manuals and in children’s literature.)

Basic narrative splits between three protagonists, at least two of whom are nauseating adolescents. One is an aristocrat, whose motivation is the juvenile version of Mme Bovary--bored with comfortable life. Another guy is some kind of faerie guard who speaks in italics, which means either telepathic or constipated (hard to discern). Third is a bucolic virgin who might have superpowers. Development, such as it is, is traditional journey/quest--though it was not obvious to me what the objective was, except that everyone was on the move. Magical kid fights a bicephalous wolf. Italics faerie gets in a naval battle (which generates the infamous “ironic agony” noted by other readers). Not sure what princess does. Ends abruptly, with no manifest purpose.

On the whole, therefore, a poorly executed YA fantasy in the tolkienian/gygaxian vein, which, pursuant to what is now known colloquially as Sturgeon’s Law, places it somewhere within the standard deviation just below the mean.

What is interesting about this text, and what makes it worthy of a quick look, is the marketing campaign that supersedes it. Much of this has been detailed at , and there’s a comical series of stanek-oriented threads at westeros.com ().

The central allegation, which author has disputed NB, is that author created hundreds of sock puppets to praise the text directly in reviews, write negative reviews of perceived competitor texts, and contribute positive reviews to other texts such as “This is a great novel, in the tradition of Tolkien, Lewis, and Stanek.” Negative reviewers of this text, taken in by this kind of marketing, were perhaps understandably perplexed by the inconsistency between the claim and specification, as it were.

I don’t care much for the seeming moral debate on sockpuppets. It is after all the internets, and most of us, I’d think, have numerous personae that we use for different purposes, rarely using our True Names, because, as we all know from the ancient texts of speculative fiction, these confer authority over the Named by the Namer (Rothfuss of course is well known for the recent deployment of this old genre convention.)

We might thus regard the text of the ‘novel’ here to be merely an excuse for the marketing campaign. When comparing the effort that must’ve went into each respective product, it appears as though the text itself were composed over a couple of PBRs one afternoon, whereas the marketing campaign is a long labor in crafting characters (internet persona, i.e.) much more believable and affective than the crude stock figures of the text. Whereas the novel itself, manifestly in the quest-oriented tradition of serialized speculative fiction, does not plainly disclose its purpose, the characters of the sock-marketing campaign have a very plain quest to call attention to the text itself, which objective is well evidenced.

Sadly, many of the primary texts of the sock-marketing campaign were deleted by amazon, goodreads, and other hosts. I regard this as the equivalent of book-burning, though I’m sure someone slick can make the case that it is truly the answer to Rauschenberg’s erasure of de Kooning (see ). The derridean reading of the whole affair likewise writes itself: the signifiers used in the construction of sock personae are merely reiterations of author, whose identity, for all we know, is more or less infinitely deferred through the process of signification. In this connection we don’t even get to the old question of authorial intent; author is absent. But: we also don’t really get to the more recent, but now old, formalist question of the text itself, which dissolves amid the much more salient text of the sockpuppetry. The socks circulate the drain of the absent text, a quantum singularity that need not be perceived directly.

We might therefore regard the performance of the socks as a slick pomo art form, for which the text is merely an occasion.

Recommending the socks for speculative fiction peoples, postmodernists, and the like."

I have to say I could have spent my time better, although looking back, they were a good laugh. The story is rather disjointed. There seem to be large chunks missing for no reason. I was very confused. I found a few of the characters mildly amusing but overall I just didn't know what the heck was going on half the time. Also the writing wasn't worth the money. It was awkward and unnatural. So...don't believe the hundreds of 5-star reviews.

There is nothing wrong with self-publishing in itself, as it lets first-time authors have a chance to publish their book in the ever-competitive publishing industry.

However, this also lets talentless hacks publish their books, without any editorial oversight. This book is NOT better than Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, et al. The writing itself is really puerile, and you can see many things in this book that have been lifted off various other works of fantasy, leaving us with a book that is really unimaginative."

The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Scott Kaelen,"April 7, 2015",1.0,"One need venture no further than the ""Look Inside"" feature on Amazon to know that Robert Stanek's ""Keeper Martin's Tales #1"" is NOT on par with Tolkien, Rowling or any other prolific author whatsoever. All cover editions for this book look as cheap as the contents they hide. The maps and illustrations are unremarkable. The location names range from awkward to bordering on plagiarism, if not over-stepping the bounds (Middle Earth?!)
But let's concentrate on the first few pages of chapter one, shall we?
After a couple of awkwardly-worded sentences, we're introduced to the character of Adrina. She's wearing a light shawl. Good and fine, but then the ambiguity of Bad Grammar kicks in well and truly with: ""A breeze blew long strands of hair across her face."" No indication whether the hair is attached to her head or has just blown in off the breeze. It goes on: ""The hair, black as the receding night, flowed to her waist."" I'm visualizing this stray thatch of hair that's randomly blown onto poor Adrina's face, falling down her body to her waist as the breeze dies. It's awkward, and it's jarring, but this is just the beginning; Mr Stanek is only getting warmed up. Wait for it.
A sentence later and we're given this: ""... for the breeze came from the north and not from the West Deep."" Am I supposed to take notice of the capitalization? I don't know. Is 'West Deep' a place? A region? Or just the 'deep west' as opposed to the 'north'? Never mind, it's still the beginning; let's move on...
""The silence seemed a shroud over the whole of Imtal clear to the Braddabaggon foothills."" Okay, we're only into the first couple of paragraphs and we've already been given four place names. And remember, this is all Adrina's thought-process. Next line...
""Many stories below, the city's residents would soon awake."" Ah, 'stories'? Surely, Mr Stanek, you mean 'storeys'? Moving on to the next paragraph...
""... for the silence echoed the aching of her heart."" Is an aching heart silent? That's a first.

Maybe it was just a few weak introductory paragraphs while the author was finding his feet. Or maybe not. In the following paragraph Adrina gives us a ridiculous info dump, aka Geography 101. We get: ""grey stone edifice,"" ""cold palace wall,"" ""portcullis tucked cleanly out of view,"" ""Great Kingdom,"" ""High Province in the north,"" ""mountains of ice and stone,"" ""rivers boiled,"" ""blankets of fog,"" ""forest of great white trees called giant birch,"" ""South Province,"" ""capital city,"" ""majestic Quashan' valley,"" ""East through the Kingdom,"" ""East-West road,"" ""Territories, divided east and west,"" ""Untamed Eastern Territories,"" ""Western Territories,"" ""Kingdom Outposts: Zashchita and Krepost',"" ""River Krepost,"" ""mountain city,"" ""cliffs,"" ""Statter's Bay."" End of paragraph. Phew. I'm exahusted.

It doesn't get better. It continues on in its flat, tedious, uninspiring prose for page after page after page. Thank the stars that I looked inside before deciding whether to purchase this book.

The one good thing about Mr Stanek's strength of prose and command of grammar (or lack thereof) is that there are moments of utterly unintentional hilarity; well, maybe not, but at least a modicum of bemusement, enough to make you shake your head and chuckle at the awful choice of words, and be glad you dodged a bullet by not paying for this garbage.

But let's look deeper. The author claims that ""Nearly a million people have read the Ruin Mist books."" He also claims ""Books by Robert Stanek have been read by well over 7.5 million people,"" and ""A book of his is sold every 60 seconds,"" and ""In 2013, his 150th book was published and there are over 1000 of his titles in distribution worldwide."" Reading ABOUT Robert Stanek is almost as exhausting as reading his actual stories. Mr Stanek appears to be notorious. With so many fans he really ought to hold conventions; it would be great to see them all in one place, wearing cotton or woollen masks depicting their beloved author's face.

Final thought: Mr Stanek is at the opposite end of the spectrum to the great JRR Tolkien. Where the grandfather of epic fantasy knew how to weave literary magic, to create wonderful characters, an amazingly-detailed world, a high command of language, and an incredibly deep mythos, by contrast Robert Stanek is the weakest imitation, and whoever it is that thinks he's on par with Tolkien is sadly deluded."

The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Christie Greenwood,"January 13, 2019",1.0,"I have to admit, I got to this thing out of curiosity due to the articles on conjugalfelicity and decided to, ya know, give it a whirl. It is, sad to say, a truly abysmal tale of woe that is not even so-bad-it's-hilarious. I'm not going to go beyond mentioning the supposed author shenanigans in passing, but none of that helped me be in any way lenient with the book itself. The sporkings on conjugalfelicity are hilarious, but the book is boring, filled with stereotypes, and just plain confusing. The prose is terribly purple and really distracts from the content the author is trying to convey (it's kind of weird and disturbing sometimes, too). You get the feeling he never edited any of it. It's impossible to read it attentively all the way through to the end. I can only speak for myself, of course, but I for one cannot recommend this 'novel'. It's not as entertaining as one might think."
The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Katy,"December 1, 2008",2.0,"Finished listening to this book on my iPod while commuting to work. I've started on the second book, so it must be at least mildy entertaining. It's not really very creative, and it drones on and on without coming to any conclusions. I think it's meant as an epic. This is only book 1, and it ends in the middle of turmoil, like the Star Wars movies. Unless you really have nothing better to do, I'd recommend listening to this while you do something else rather than reading it, as it is really a good time waster."
The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,EA Solinas,"January 24, 2016",1.0,"How do you market a wretched fantasy book to a much younger audience? Why, you chop it in half and sell it as two separate, shorter books!

Sadly for Robert Stanek's ""The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,"" which is the first half of ""Keeper Martin's Tales."" this just highlights what a confusing, frustrating train wreck his attempt at an epic fantasy is. There's almost nothing going on (even compared to the later works of Robert Jordan), the characters are disastrously shallow and/or obnoxious, the conflict is impossible to understand, and the way that Stanek writes every scene is brain-meltingly dull.

I wish I could summarize this book properly, but it's difficult to even do that much. Basically, a war is brewing among the four kingdoms, although I'm not sure who the villains are, what caused the conflict, or why the heroes are involved. It's not a good sign for an epic fantasy when your initial response is a long string of one-word questions: ""Why? How? When? What? Huh?""

Three particular characters become embroiled in the conflict -- sociopathic ""spunky princess"" Adrina, the befuddled elf bodyguard Seth, and the sadistic magical child Vilmos. Vilmos is taken under the wing of wizened magician Xith; Seth is sent by the Elf Queen to get involved in... some conflict; and Adrina, after much contrived castle intrigue, goes... somewhere with her love interest Emel.

Yeah, ""Keeper Martin's Tales"" was a disaster of a book, but ""The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches"" is actually WORSE than the book it makes up the first half of. Stanek took what little substance the original ""adult"" book had, and halved it. Even if this semi-crooked approach to publishing weren't.... well, semi-crooked, this was not a good thing. It actually highlights just how LITTLE is actually going on in the story... and it ends at a totally random spot with a very awkwardly-placed ""to be continued.""

It's also painfully confusing; I had no idea what caused the war, who was involved in it, or even who the villains were. Robert Stanek is absolutely ghastly at exposition -- he's one of those authors who seems to assume that you understand all the terminology and backstory of his world without actually EXPLAINING it or finding some way (ancient texts, letters, dialogue) to exposit.

The plot (if you can say there is one) is a meandering disaster of inexplicable events (Vilmos encounters a two-headed beast that... has nothing to do with anything else). Stanek doesn't really bother to give any actual texture to his imaginary world and cultures -- there's a castle, and there's a place with elves and mood-ring rooms, but not much else. It's like a 2-dimensional stage set. Also, Stanek clearly has no idea how subplots progress, since he flings his characters to wherever he feels like putting them, without warning. For instance, in one chapter Seth is hanging out in the Elf... city? Country? Civilization?.... and the next he's suddenly in battle hundreds of miles away.

Furthermore, Stanek has a writing style that manages to be both bloated and vacuous, so that the act of reading it is like trying to do the backstroke in zero gravity. There's little substance there, but you have to slog through so much that it becomes exhausting to try to read. He keeps using words that he clearly doesn't understand (""Galan had the insatiable curiosity of a preborn child"") and phrases that don't belong in a fantasy book (""It is called non-corporeal stasis, an out of body experience""). His writing simply rambles on without any actual POINT, littered with gaping plot holes, terrible metaphors, and Big Significant Events that.... aren't. And of course, his dialogue often sinks into nonsense (“Rouse two guards to council doors"").

Stanek's characters are almost as ghastly as his prose -- Adrina, Seth and Vilmos all show signs of sociopathic behavior, whether it's frightening other people for fun or cold-bloodedly manipulating them. Nobody in this book does anything in a logical manner, bursting into tears or freaking out based on... whatever the author wants them to do at a given moment. Adrina is a particularly annoying character, since she also embodies the Rebellious Princess trope. So she would be irritating even if she weren't a sociopath.

As if ""Keeper Martin's Tales"" wasn't teeth-grindingly annoying already, ""The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches"" takes what little content Stanek's book had... and gives you only half for your money. Save your money for a book by Tolkien."
The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Daniel Jacobs,"April 24, 2017",1.0,"I tried to read this. Sweet raptor Jesus, did I try. But this is beyond bad.
To tell you how bad exactly, the one person I know that managed to finish this mess and have some understanding of what's going on had to maintain his personal wiki to be able to google shit when he lost the plot.
I am not as dedicated. This book is incredibly badly written, filled with ridiculous similies and comparisons, one note characters that do almost nothing until the plot requires them too and events that I just don't know why are happening.
Most of the action in this book is OFF SCREEN. A great example is when in one chapter, A-team of characters is preparing for battle, then for a few chapters we switch to the B-team and then when we come back to the A-team, they just TALK about what a fight they had. And this isn't the only case where stuff I'd really like to read about is left to my imagination or spelled out in dialogue.

And that's all aside of the entire marketing and lying fiasco that the author personally is...
I might come back to this occasionally to at least TRY and finish it. I mean I finished 50 shades of Grey and Save the Pearls.

Let that sink in, I managed to read through SAVE THE FUCKING PEARLS but this is the book I couldn't finish. It's nowhere near as offensive as that racist piece of shit, but the writing is so bad I just... I can't.
It's like sitting down to watch a so-bad-it's-good movie and then realizing someone put on ""MANOS"" but without the MST3K riff. You just can't deal with that."

The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,Keith,"March 18, 2016",1.0,"Another badly written ""fantasy""* novel composed mainly of cliches and elements of earlier, better works thrown together without much originality, written by an author (sorry, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR) seemingly more interested in self-promotion than in crafting a good story. See also the works of Morgan Rice, Allegra Skye, et al.

This clumsily titled book is (of course) the first in some apparently vast series, and as such is simply setup for future installments (with a large part of its pagecount being taken up by a huge glossary). Not a huge amount seems to happen at all, in fact, as it's divided between at least three non-interacting protagonists, two of whom are straight out of Generic Young Adult Fantasy 101: a rebellious princess and a young boy in a backwater village with special powers. The supporting cast continue the theme, with multiple mysterious mentor figures who say cryptic things about destiny, the obligatory unpleasant parental figure, the guy the princess has belligerent romantic tension with, etc. The third protagonist, an elven knight/bodyguard dispatched by his queen to protect the obligatory Chosen One, has some potential to be an interesting character (e.g. the fact that he's out of his depth and finds studying human culture confusing). His plotline also has glimmerings of imagination in its depiction of the elves' culture, but like the others, it is dragged down by vague, padded-out writing rife with cliches.

In summary: there are far better fantasy works out there, don't bother with this one unless you want to look at a shining example of the worst side of the genre.

*Quotation marks because there is little or nothing fantastical or imaginative about most stories of this sort; they're simply adventure stories that happen to use the standard-issue Generic Fantasy Setting as their backdrop."

The Clansman,Erin,"July 28, 2022",1.0,"America is under Negro reign, violence and chaos is everywhere. No one respects law & order anymore. The streets aren't safe for white women and white men can no longer support their families. The country needs a savior. It needs strong Aryan men who love their country and will fight to make it great again.

America needs The Ku Klux Klan.

The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan, is one of the most racist books ever written. I first became aware of this book after watching the silent film The Birth of a Nation, in which the KKK is presented as brave heroes and American patriots. The author Rev. Thomas Dixon was a respected author, statesman and speaker in his day. Rev. Dixon claimed to not be a racist, he said he was a Nationalist and a patriot. He believed in America first policies, he believed that Negroes didn't belong in this country because they were slow-witted and prone to great violence. He feared that the acceptance of Negroes and immigrants into this country would destroy the ""True American"" heritage.

I went into this book expecting to be angered by the racism and outraged. Instead I found it funny. It was so over the top racist. The descriptions of Black people in this book were cartoonish. Every black man in this book had big red lips, big flat noses, big ape-like feet and they all smelled like the jungle. Black men spent their days drunk, fighting and raping innocent sweet white maidens. Also black women used Voodoo to rape white men and poison children.

I read The Clansman very fast. I just couldn't put it down. That doesn't mean it was well written but I just had to know how the KKK would save America from those evil jungle Niggers and their Yankee co-conspirators. I'm tempted to read the other 2 books in the series but I don't know if my brain or stomach can handle it.

No rec but I think about 30% of the country would really like it.

The Clansman,Werner,"October 9, 2018",1.0,"Note, Oct. 9, 2018: I edited this slightly just now, only to clarify what comments brought this book to mind to review it; in the original review, that was very ambiguous. (I was new to Goodreads at the time, and hadn't had much experience in reviewing for this site!)

A comment I made on another Goodreads thread sparked a good discussion about the misguided ways some writers treat the subject of rape. That brought to mind this piece of dreck, which I read back at a time when I had much more morbid curiosity in my reading tastes than I do now (obviously, I read an older edition). Dixon was a vile racist; in this novel, the Klan are portrayed as heroes, and virtually all of the black characters are depicted in a highly derogatory fashion --the one exception being a former slave who's presented favorably only because he's very loyal to his ex-master. (Margaret Mitchell, who wrote , was a closeted fan of Dixon, as her correspondence with him reveals --that doesn't constitute much of a recommendation for her novel either!) On top of this, he had no more talent for writing fiction than I would have for doing brain surgery; the book is a morass of cardboard characters, unrealistic dialogue, wildly improbable plot developments (one is a particular howler) and grotesque liberties with history.

What reminded me of this book in the context of the discussion alluded to above is the fact that Dixon presents suicide as an appropriate and even morally obligatory response by the rape victim to the experience (on the theory that she's hopelessly ""defiled"" by it anyway). Granted, this doesn't exactly ""trivialize"" rape, as some readers felt that some writers do; but on a scale of 1-10 for constructive and intelligent responses, this one ranks as about a minus 7,863! :-( The publisher who re-printed this crap owes an apology to the trees destroyed for the paper."
The Clansman,Jason Pierce,"November 29, 2017",5.0,"(For the actual review, scroll down (it's clearly marked). I indulge myself with some family flim-flam and general history for a few paragraphs first, though it's all tangentially related to the book).

It took three days shy of two years, but I finally finished this. The reason it took so long is not due to it being a bad book (just look at the rating I gave it), but because I have a 1907 version that used to belong to my great-grandfather. I stumbled upon it as mama and I were purging her extensive book collection. As you likely know, the movie was based on this novel and the subsequent play. Being a history man, I was thrilled to find this treasure, an actual artifact from the past, at my fingertips. Being prone to fits of fantastic romantic nonsense, I saw this copy as precious, much more precious than any reprint could ever be. It was a part of family history.

I soon discovered that reading the way one would read any other book (laid back in a chair with it flipped open in my hand) would destroy it completely, and I set it aside after a few chapters until I could find a safer way to read it. Even holding it carefully seemed to be too much for it. I could've bought a new copy, but part of the charm was in reading an ancestor's copy. Actually, that was all of the charm. (This thing is hardly charming). The Writing Pig came to my rescue with a solution. WP is some old, pig-shaped cutting board we found somewhere ages ago that fits nicely on the arms of my chair, and we use it as a desk for writing notes, paying bills, and what not. It also makes a nice reading desk. I was able to set the book upon it and gingerly turn the pages without it falling to pieces. A friend thinks I'm nuts to be touching it at all, but like I said, reading a reprint to finish it would be no fun at all; it would lose all its specialness.

I began to wonder if great-granddaddy was a member of the KKK. You can't fairly judge someone by what they read. (My shelf includes this, , , , , , , , , , , and just what do you make of all that?) But it wouldn't be unusual for him to have been in it. He would've been 18 or 19 in 1907 (the age of natural hot-headedness), and 26/27 in 1915 when the Klan reformed. He was a rural southerner. He may have seen the movie and got caught up in the tide. It's estimated that as much as 15% of the eligible population (around six million male WASPs) were members of the second KKK in the late 1910's/early 1920's.


In 1925, 400,000 members held a parade in Washington, DC. The third KKK has never had more than 8,000 members at one time. 400K at one event! Hell, great-gramps might even be in the parade for all I know. Then again, it's just as possible that he wasn't even a member. The only fact I have is that he once owned this book. Does that make him racist? No, but I'm pretty sure he was anyway. Does me giving this five stars make me racist? Some people will think so, but I reckon there's nothing I can do about that.

Still, this is also the same great-grandfather who let a black kid (probably a preteen or early teenager) named Buttercup stay in the house for several months or a couple of years during the great depression, so who knows? The corner of the house where his bed was located is still referred to as Buttercup's room. I even slept in it sometimes when I was a kid before that section was walled-in and converted to an upstairs bathroom about 30 years ago. I believe a black kid living with whites in the rural south was a rarity back then, so this was rather forward thinking of my ancestors. I think Buttercup worked for food and lodging, and I know he and granddaddy (great gramps' son) rumbled a couple of times.

Here's something everyone should know about the Ku Klux Klan. There have been three of them. All of them purport white supremacy and engaged in terrorism, but there were differences between the three. The first one lasted five or so years in the late 1860's-early 1870's and was a response to Reconstruction. Ex-confederates were getting what some would consider their just desserts, but they weren't going to take it and formed an organization to fight back. Ideologically it was formed to fight Reconstruction. Though blacks were certainly a part of that, carpetbaggers and scalawags were also caught in the cross hairs. A lot of the murders and assassinations were committed against whites as well. Eventually the Klan disbanded due to federal push back of a military nature, and the harsher aspects of Reconstruction were fizzling, so the fight was no longer necessary.

The second KKK started in 1915 due to . After reading this book, I can understand how it happened. This thing is masterfully put together, and would appeal to people who felt they were losing control of things which was the sentiment in the early 20th century after record immigrant influx. Pre Civil War immigration made a kind of stew, and flavors melded into each other as immigrants attempted to assimilate themselves into American society, though they still kept vestiges of their heritage. Beef, corn, butter beans, etc. all carried the other flavors as well as that of the tomato base. Later immigration was more like a salad bowl. In cities separate communities were popping up. Chinatown, Italian boroughs, Irish, Eastern European centers, etc. You had your cukes next to your lettuce, next to your mushrooms, next to your croutons. Nothing was mixing anymore, and established people don't like that. This new incarnation wasn't fighting the government as much as trying to influence it, and they added Jews, Catholics, and a few other nationalities to the list of less-thans. In effect, it was nativist in nature. It also encompassed the entire country and not just the South, though more violence happened in the southern states. A Grand Dragon in Indiana getting caught raping and murdering a school teacher took the wind out of this KKK's sails, and it collapsed; members left in droves. A small group would keep it officially going through WWII, and small independent groups would claim the name in the 50s and 60s.

The third Klan came about in the 70's to fight the Civil Rights movement (which only took 90 years to show up after Reconstruction. More on that below). It's pretty much just a hate group. They don't stand ""for"" something as much as they're ""against"" non WASPs.


Also, they frequently appear on the Jerry Springer show, so how seriously can you take them?












































A lot of people won't be able to get past the racist aspect of the book. If you're one of those, then I suggest leaving it alone. I think everyone who can read something objectively should read this. It's important to remember history and to know certain things so they don't get repeated. If you're looking for Lost Cause propaganda to support your stance and justify your hate, then I guess this is a good book for you, but I'd rather you didn't read it. Try some more tolerant literature instead. (That's just me on my high horse.) Good prose? This book's got it. Dixon writes well, I won't gainsay it.

So there you have it. This book brought out a lot of conflicting emotions in me, so be prepared for quite a ride if you give it try."
The Clansman,Therese,"February 12, 2018",,"You can't just...review The Clansman. You can't apply the perfectly lovely star system provided by Goodreads that indicates your pleasure taken, your appreciation of the literary craft. The Clansman has craft and provides intrigue but...dude, it's a story of how necessary it was to organize the Ku Klux Klan to keep post-Civil War white folks from being brutalized by bitter Northern conquerors and their black lackeys.

The Klan are the good guys in this story. What are we supposed to do with THIS?

I'm going to tell you about this story, because it WAS well written enough that I not only fell into the plot, but understood the politics Dixon was trying to lay out for the common man to understand. That's actually quite a feat, I hate politics.

Dixon gives us a cast (the ""romance"" part) of white folks, both Yankees and Rebels. All are honorable and kind. The Yankee smart strong nurse who doesn't care whose side of the war her patients were on, since the war just ended we're ALL Americans again. The genteel, dignified but strong as steel Southern belles who remain gracious and godly in their tattered dresses. Brave good-natured young soldiers from both sides, all of whom are someone's human brother or son. Dixon (who was, among other things, a preacher) establishes that he is capable of empathy and values virtue, which makes the rest of his story all the more shocking.

The villain of the piece is a Senator named Stoneman. He hates the South for their treachery and will do anything to see them punished. His friend President Abraham Lincoln, tells him to chill out. He says he has not ""conquered"" the South, but he has reclaimed his own nation. They will not be punished, they will be enveloped back into the American fold as prodigal sons.

Stoneman (and this is where it get's trippy...cuz Stoneman's a total asshole) demands the Black Man have rights, all the rights and more, of the white men. Lincoln says that's impossible. Two races have never lived peacefully, one always conquers the other. Lincoln says without slavery to hold the social ranks in place, he intends to deport the black folks back to tropical climates and help them colonize their own new homes. Which makes the Great Emancipator sound like a racist douche, right? But it's true, historically. Lincoln wasn't particularly anti-slavery. He just suspected black folks and white folks could never get along on equal footing.

Doesn't matter what Lincoln thought, cuz he gets killed and Stoneman gets his way. Then our story gets ugly. Reconstruction, the period of brutal treatment of the South following the War, begins.

Reconstruction seems to be an attempt to defile the corpse of an already dead land. Taxes are high enough to starve the survivors of this war ground. Black men are given the vote but white Southerns are traitors and cannot have it. Black men are given positions of authority over their formal masters, and counseled that they are just as good as white men and to act like it.

Which is right and good and true...but not in Dixon's world! How can these black people be put in authority, he asks. This is a horrible and cruel farce. Dixon points out that African slaves were taken from a continent rich in gold and diamonds the Africans never found or used them. That Africans never even figured out how to invent the wheel, much less any innovation or invention to add to the world. He posited that through biology or God's will or whatever, they simply were NOT as advanced as the other races on our planet. Not their fault, but they can't be on equal footing with white people. They biologically just cannot.

There are mulattoes in this book and they are the worst. They are haughty and smooth, manipulative with the intelligence of their white ancestors clashing with the bestial nature of their black ancestors. (Dixon doesn't dwell on how these mulattoes came to be born in the first place, but in the history he's created it was most certainly the work of devious slave women seducing their masters, probably with witchcraft. Statistical records that seem to indicate a lot of raped fourteen year old girls don't make an appearance. There is no indication that there ever was such a thing as a cruel slave-owner.) And the fully black ex-slaves, who are now uniformed soldiers carrying the guns white men are not allowed to have...they are described in the harshest physical terms I've ever read...deformed, bloated apes, purple engorged lips and cro-magnon brows and their own peculiar awful smell. Dixon just oozes hate.

He also makes it clear that the Yankees don't actually care one bit about the welfare of black people. They just want to humiliate and punish The South, and the best way to do that is give control to the ex-slaves, who they know will run amok like children and drive an already defeated people into the ground. Every governmental office in some states was filled by a Freedman, whom, Dixon notes, was usually illiterate, power-drunk, and completely ignorant of how his job was supposed to be done.

Then the book gives us a new character, the sweetest and most adored teenage girl in the whole village, and her loving mother. They, like all the other Southerners we meet, have maintained genial Southern warmth and dignity despite their shoddy clothes and hungry bellies. So of course that young girl is brutally gang raped by her father's old slaves. The next morning the mother and daughter work together to clean up all evidence of the attack and leap off a cliff together, sparing the daughter a lifetime of misery and, allowing her to die with her name unbesmirched.

Well, that tears it. Enter the Clan...which stars all the beloved characters of the story in one way or another, who've been secretly gathering strength as the indignities against them grow to unbearable proportion.

The men ride to avenge. They will no longer be terrorized by the angry animals seeking revenge on the masters who treated them with benevolence, the masters who were following Biblical law regarding slaves, the masters who thought of them as ""family."" All the bad black men are killed or scared out of office and out of town. They meekly and with cringingly written duplicity happily go back to declaring themselves ""simple niggers."" The south didn't rise again. Well, Coca-cola is based in Atlanta so that's something.

So what do we do with a book like The Clansman?

If you want to understand the world, and be wise, I think you have to really understand the people you disagree with. People rarely do things because they are evil, or even stupid. They have REASONS. They think they are good, and right, and they have evidence for their beliefs.

The Clansman takes you to a place you won't be able to find anywhere else. Where someone of education and historical knowledge and close experience (Dixon was born just before the War ended and grew up during Reconstruction), tells you why they think the way they do. How thoughts that are stomach turning ignorance to us today, could be reasonably believed then.

This is propaganda, of course. There is only one side told here. But, that's when you realize, right or wrong, you've grown up only hearing one side as well. We just never considered there WAS another side to ""is the Klan a good thing?"" ""Was the South nice in the days of slavery?"" ""Did ex-slaves ever do anything wrong?"" The answer is automatically...who cares?

And that's a fair enough answer. The evil of it all can obliterate the desire to understand deeper. But, if you truly want to know how people could hate another race so viciously, how racial animosity on both sides can still run at full boil 150 years after the end of slavery...this book is a good start. This is raw and uncensored, unapologetic information, perhaps recon from the enemy camp. But it is legitimate knowledge. Though I can't blame you if you don't have the stomach for it.

* I listened to this via public domain audiobook. It was narrated by a pleasant voiced older southern woman, probably not a professional actor, named Michele Fry. She was somehow absolutely perfect. She kept an amazing neutrality, without being dull, as she told such an alarming and upsetting story."
The Clansman,Thara,"August 30, 2007",1.0,"Chill out, I'm reading it for class."
The Clansman,Shaun,"January 14, 2016",3.0,"This controversial novel by Thomas Dixon, written in 1905, tells a story of how a man, a county, a state and ultimately the southern people fought back against the North during the period of reconstruction. Following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the North installs puppet ""negro governments"" in the southern states by granting negroes suffrage. This leads to chaos as ""Now a negro electorate controlled the city government, and gangs of drunken negroes, its sovereign citizens, paraded the streets at night firing their muskets unchallenged and unmolested."" This book was published as a warning to the North about what Dixon regarded as the dangers of granting the vote to non-whites. This book is actually the second installment of a trilogy. I've not read either of the other books. is the first book. is the third book.

This book has important historical significance because it gives insight to the now extremely unpopular post-Civil War southern point of view that might otherwise be lost to the ages. Anyone interested in US history should probably read this book if they are to understand the sentiments of Southerners during (and after) reconstruction.

Dixon can be a fairly engaging writer but this piece is rife with grammatical and historical and scientific inaccuracies. This book is a sentimental work. It appeals not to the reason of the readers, but to their emotions. Dixon portrays black people as living, breathing cartoon characters. The story gets ridiculous when he's writing about black people. But it's much better when he's writing about white people. Also, Dixon was under the impression that hypnosis could be used to force people to tell the truth even if they were unwilling. This was a popular misconception at the time. Hypnosis was shrouded in mystery. In fact, the term hypnosis only came in to popular use around 1880. But we now know that hypnosis doesn't work that way. Unfortunately, Dixon incorporates the use of hypnosis in to his story in such a way. This destroys the believability of the scene.

The story told by the book is a little bit scattered and rambling. The meat of the story, in a way, doesn't even really begin until the end of the book.

I recommend this book if you're interested in learning about the white southern perspective following the civil war. Most readers will probably be offended. As a story and as a work of literature, this novel is just ok. I wouldn't recommend reading it for the entertainment value. It is in the public domain and copies of it are available online."

A review by Anthony T. Riggio of The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan by Thomas Dixon Jr.

This is an historical novel by a Southerner attempting to justify the need and rise of the Klu Klux Clan written in 1905, forty years after the Civil War. His story revolves around some of the truly unintended consequences of reconstruction, hijacked by vindictive Northern politicians and greedy profiteers.

Several reviewers brand the author a “vile racist” and a “White Supremacist”. I believe these sobriquets are unfair and the reviewers are looking at the actions through the lenses of modern day understandings.

I believe the purpose of Thomas Dixon’s novel was to communicate an idea of the perceptions of many Southerners which have impacted on the total assimilation of Blacks even until today. That there are racist feelings by both Whites and Blacks stemming from Slavery and then Reconstruction is manifest today. The Story “The Clansman” gives only a glimpse of the feelings of the Whites who were formally in control and the struggles with real and imaginary views of abuses of those agents of Reconstruction.

I believe to brand this book and its author as racist is a disservice to History. What was or was perceived is, and it may disturb some sensitive types who want to view the relations between Whites and Blacks as continually strident and without solution.

I purchased this book from Amazon for my Kindle and believe it is a compelling story."

The Clansman,Patricia Dietz,"December 22, 2014",3.0,"The author of this book lived through the post-Civil War Reconstruction period in the south. Laying aside his personal hatred and profound contempt for blacks (if that's possible, as the book is full of it)a few things stood out for me. One was the extent to which, back in those days, women truly were the possessions of their male relatives to the point where their husbands, fathers or brothers would literally rather put a bullet through the woman's head than permit her to shame herself or the family by being a rape victim. The woman's value as a person in her own right, the right to exist apart from her role as wife or daughter or sister was almost nonexistent.

The other was the realization that the North was directly responsible for the creation of the Ku Klux Klan. The wide-spread atrocities encouraged by the men put in control of local governments and the extensive post-war rape of the old south forced people with literally no other defense to organize and try to defend themselves. It was quite an eye opener. Once the ex-Confederate white man got the vote back--some political power and protection within the legal system--the original Klan was disbanded as no longer necessary. Pretty interesting stuff. In those circumstances, I'd have joined too!

Finally, if John Wilkes Boothe had not murdered President Lincoln, the Reconstruction would never have occurred to the terrible extent that it did, and very likely, in my opinion, the Klan would never have existed."
The Clansman,Kenneth,"April 27, 2019",3.0,"The second volume of the author's Reconstruction Trilogy. A story of the American South in the years after the Civil War, told from a white Southern point of view and very racist - par for the era it was written in. The Ku Klux Clan is presented as a Southern white organization set up to resist the Yankee carpetbaggers and their Negro allies. D.W. Griffith's 1915 silent film ""The Birth of a Nation"" was based on this book. But for all that, Dixon told a good story, as I remember - I read it sometime in my Junior High/High School years, the copy belonged to my grandmother, now in my possession."
The Clansman,Richard Epstein,"October 14, 2014",1.0,"If it weren't for Thomas Dixon, Jr., Josh wouldn't have to keep teaching ""Birth of a Nation."" We were not spared even by Dixon's passing through the opal gates of death."
The Clansman,Tiffany,"May 5, 2017",3.0,"Surprisingly, this wasn't a bad book (You don't have to agree with the sentiment to think a book is decently written). Dixon calls this a ""historical romance of the Ku Klux Klan,"" and it definitely is written as a romance, with very flowery language and dialogue at times that is almost phony. The events were often overly melodramatic, too. That said, it was a page-turner for me. Flowery and melodramatic, yes, but decent story.

As I read the opening sections of this, I was surprised Dixon made Lincoln sound like such a good/nice guy. I would have thought a book written as a defense/explanation of the KKK would portray him as a villain.

I was reading at one point, thinking to myself, ""Huh, nearly halfway through, and this is a pretty even-handed book. Pros and cons for both North and South. I'm surprised."" But then not 10 minutes later, ""drunken negroes,"" with their ""onion-laden breath"" and ""African odour""... So nevermind about it being fair and even-handed. The way Dixon describes some of the black characters is also questionable. At times it's hard to tell whether he's being very descriptive about one particular character or if he's making generalizations about the physical and mental traits of *all* black people. ... But then we have the ""negro odour"" again and similar comments (""animal odour,"" ""imaginary horrors of slavery,"" ""laziness and incapacity of the negro""), and I think he's just racist (although, at the time this was written, that wasn't considered racist, etc. etc, cultural relativity and whatnot).

And for a ""romance of the Ku Klux Klan,"" the Klan doesn't really come until towards the end. This is more about the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction, not so much about the KKK. Yes, it's all tied together, but from the title and subtitle, I expected way more of the Klan in the story."
The Clansman,Kevin Keating,"June 27, 2021",4.0,"The intro of this book (by Thomas D Clark) says this is a book which will interest many thousands of readers of all degrees of taste and education. He also says no one of critical judgement will find any literary craftsmanship in it. I agree with the first part and disagree with the second. Dixon can write very well but has chosen a plot which is without a whole lot of nuance. As to the subject of the book, Reconstruction, Dixon epitomizes the incredibly racist views of the early 1900s (the era of eugenics) and also the views of Southerners under Reconstruction. It has the most racist descriptions I have read in decades. And yet it is included in the U of Kentucky's series called The Novel as American Social History. If you can handle it, it can be very instructive about Southern attitudes. Your call. I give it 4 stars because it is of interest and I bet it has been banned by nearly everyone these days."

The novel covers the first election after the 1867 Reconstruction Acts, when Black men were able to vote and South Carolina had the first Black majority legislature.

White women are simply a pawn, an excuse to cause violence against Black men.

Dixon tries to paint the evil during the reconstruction era as the Yankees, republicans, and carpetbaggers instead of what we all know it was, the KKK and southern white men.

The book and movie were successful in getting people to believe this pile of garbage. The 20th century textbooks in the south were quite similar to this novel, as they were written by Daughters of the Confederacy. Many southerners still believe reconstruction was evil and unfair to them and the Klan was heroic. Disgusting, racist, propaganda."

The Clansman,Jeff,"September 6, 2018",3.0,"This is an important book to read. It was very popular at the time of its first publication and had a big impact on USA culture, as you probably know. It is written as propaganda for White Supremacy and sparked a major revival in the development of the KKK.

As a piece of propaganda, I can see why it was so successful. Dixon is a very good storyteller. He shamelessly glorifies the origins of the Klan. His writing was so effective that I could feel the emotions Dixon (a Baptist preacher) wanted to evoke arising in me despite my revulsion against his hateful and disgusting racial ideology. This made the book much harder to read.

Dixon beastializes the recently freed Black community to a degree that is incredible today. Of course, many White folk in his day did not have a personal relationship with any Black people through work or school or church. Their only exposure to Black people were through the highly distorted lenses of the newspapers and the Minstrel Shows. This explains how such blatant propaganda could be found credible back then.

This book serves as an effective warning. Every age and nation has their own scape goats. We have ours. We must read critically. We must put ourselves in the shoes of others. We must take folks who are different at face value. We must be aware of each writer's agenda. Every writer has an agenda.

Still today many White people have little contact with Black people. I am 57 and most folks my age went to integrated public schools. Most White folks have Black co-workers or professional relationships with Black business owners in their community. We have Black police officers and Black elected officials, not to mention Black celebrities. Given all this exposure to real Black people, it would be hard for a book like THE CLANSMAN to be as popular today as it was in 1905.

However, the beastialization of Black folk continues among White people even today. In my own county, earlier this year an off-duty police officer working as security at a local movie theater called three Black girls animals and treated them accordingly. Adults who were present testified that these three teens were not doing anything different than their White peers. The officer felt it was appropriate to make examples of the Black youth only, confident that the White youth would be more compliant once they saw how tough he was. Parents confirm that such overt racism happens every week at this theater.

It doesn't take much extrapolation to see that this happens everyday in every community in the good old US of A. 1905 was just 100 years ago. Some things have changed a little. Not much. Black folk are still being lynched. Only the tools of the lynching have changed. Taking a look back at the popular racism of our grandparents day can help us to open our eyes to our own popular forms of racism today."
The Clansman,richard,"September 17, 2020",4.0,"A descriipton and justification for the creation of the KKK. Racist in the extreme. Views Blacks as sub-human. Nasty in its depiction of African Americans.

Now, understand, the above is my reaction to the conent (some of it) of the book in 2020. (back to this fact in a minute). It was not written in 2020, but 115 years ago! That doesn't make its thesis correct but it does give some context. The book was the basis for the movie ""Birth of a Nation."" I have only seen bits and pieces of the movie but the book is not as graphic as depicted in the movie. Dixon, the author, was born at the end of the Civil War, in the South. He was a Baptis minister, legislator, writer, i.e,. part of the elite. He had a privleged point of view. He was probably what we would call a racist. But he was a racist from another generation - another time - and I don't think we can judge him by our standards today. Although, we can still judge him.

The book has some other aspects that I think should be mentioned. Some history here, although I am not a Civil War buff and not sure of the accuracy of all. Lincoln did consider colonization of blacks; I did not not know/remember that so I looked it up. Lincoln did fight his own party on a number of things and often had knock-down-drag-outs with his cabinent. Reconstruction did not go go well in the South. Some decent love affairs develop between Northerners and Southerners, and a heartwarming- turning to heartbreaking - story about innocent youth soiled sort of catches in your throat. There is also a fairly realistic confession and repentance scene at the end. And, finally, Dixon is not a bad writer.

Back to 2020! It is easy for me to visualize current day White Supremasists pulling this book off the shelf, relishing the ""granduer"" of the Old South, and pledging to ""follow the cause."" That would be too bad. We all can learn from this story if we want to. We should not dismiss it simply as racist filth. The South had a history and point of view that not only colored their view but determined it. Nor was the Northern populace overwhelmingly supportive of abolition and welcoming of Blacks; this was a ""Southern problem"" and it needed to stay ""down there."" I find it nearly impossible to understand the racism that is so apparent in our country today. But, this story may accurately portray a people - then and today - AFRAID of losing a way of life that is all they ever knew, to people - Black, Brown, other/different - that they have grown up distrusting, even hating. We can say ""Too bad, they deserve to get what they dish out,"" like Stoneman did in the story. Or we can TRY to hear their stories and their fears and work to find a way to bridge the gap that seems to grow every day. Lots of ambivalence here."
The Clansman,Lamar Latrell,"August 3, 2019",1.0,"hoo boy. I have a lot of thoughts about this book.
When I started this book, I figured it was going to be a white supremist/mudshark cuckold fantasy, wherein at some point, a white woman falls in love with a black guy, and needs a white man to rescue her and teach her the error of her ways. I wasn’t far off.
That the catalyst for action for the clan was a black man raping a white girl may not have been exactly what I imagined, I think I got pretty close just from the title.
It’s not a good book. It’s poorly written and poorly developed. The characters are, at best, one-dimensional, but really, they are representations of concepts and ideas, rather than actual characters—that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It is overly-long because of its attempt to create emotional connections between the reader and the caricatures of people in the book.



On the other hand, it’s a wonderful insight into the mind of someone who was so completely convinced of white superiority that this is the only possible outcome. 20th century US history plays out pretty closely to what he describes, and I fully believe that it had that arc because the film became such an important cultural marker, it influenced the course of history. (That the KKK enjoyed a resurgence because of the popularity of the film is an indisputable fact.) It’s impossible (provided one is not convinced of white superiority) to not see Stoneman as a sort of tragic anti-hero, who is trying to create “the future liberals want”. The concept of conservatism being a typically southern trait is mentioned several times.
It’s not a good book, and I certainly wouldn’t recommend it to anyone, but I’m hard-pressed to name a better example of a marker of some of the bigger problems (not only racial, but also of the north vs. south) the US has, but has not addressed."
The Clansman,David Stephens,"January 29, 2023",1.0,"For anyone halfway aware of the film The Birth of a Nation (for which The Clansman is its basis), it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that Thomas Dixon rewrote history according to his own white supremacist views. The Clansman is really nothing but one long orgasmic rebel moan for the lost world of southern civility where the phrase “you darned old sockdologing man trap” induces winces and hand-wringing but the owning and degrading of an entire race of human beings is perfectly acceptable.

But what begins as a sappy, melodramatic tale of Confederate apologia slowly turns into a bizarre fantasy–where birds tweet racial slurs and southern white doctors either have uncanny powers of intuition or the ability to retrieve images from the retinas of corpses–before finally flaring up into some of the most cruel and hateful writing I’ve ever witnessed.

For in between riveting scenes of Congress working diligently to destroy the south and constant reminders of how valiant and noble and tender and gracious and charming and determined and loyal and logical every southern is (as depicted by the oh-so generous hooded group of white knights these southerners eventually form) are just an excessive number of derogatory depictions of former slaves. D.W. Griffith’s cinematic counterpart feels almost tame and enlightened by comparison if for no other reason because it just can’t go into the level of detail the book can.

Again, I know the book is built on a foundation of racism and none of this should really be that shocking to me, but I didn’t realize how many times I would have to stop reading to try and not throw up. I like reading authors I disagree with, but, wow, was this a mistake."
The Clansman,CJ Louis,"January 7, 2020",2.0,"I feel like I have heard of this book before, but only remember hearing about it from a documentary stating that it was the nidus for The Birth of a Nation. Knowing the status of the film and hearing it was based on a novel made the book an instant must have and read.

It is fascinating to read the book through today's lens and to also consider the mindset of the people during the era in which the story is set. The story is not all that compelling and but seems to make a decent argument for removing racial segregation and uniting everyone as equals. However, this idea falls flat with most characters rather quickly, except for one character until the very end who seemed to support the former slaves; additionally, any and all characters that support the African American cause still views them as lesser beings.

An interesting note is the way Dixon describes the purpose of the KKK, that it is not to explicitly keep African Americans down, rather it is to support the equality of others and prevent harm to innocent people. But at the same time, he paints the African Americans as brutes and monsters, a class of people everyone needs to be protected from. In this manner he is able to persuade both separationists and sympathists that there needs to be some force, group, etc. to maintain order and keep the former slaves in the lowest rung of society.

I am glad I was able to read this book, but don't think it will be for everyone and think a lot of people will be repelled by the theme of the novel. I think to understand a lot of what happens today, we need to look back at yesterday."
The Clansman,Kristie Hayes,"July 5, 2018",4.0,"Hard to read but important

it is very densely written and it seems with the level of detail is was created in a way that it could be a play or a movie. The Birth of a Nation was based off of this book. There are differences but the idea the same. Post Civil war, black people have taken over the South and it is chaos. They are presented as barbaric and dimwitted, and the book is obviously meant to be a propaganda piece. The Northerners who go South are charmed by the Southerners and start to see how they have been wronged. It is historical fiction created to romanticize what many white Southerners believed was the correct order of society and how losing the civil war upended it. If this is how many white Southerners still see their place in this era, it explains why we are where we are today as a country."
The Clansman,Kathy Apple,"April 23, 2019",4.0,"Although the writing is sometimes hard to follow, due, I suppose to the ""times"" in which it was written, the story is reflective of the horrors brought on the South by carpetbaggers and vengeful Northerners. By allowing the negroes to go from protected slavery where (in mostly all situations) their every need was addressed, into positions of armed authority when they couldn't read, write, understand, stay sober and certainly not make informed decisions and lacking the intelligence and discipline to take advantage of their new status as freedmen, the inevitable clash between these ignorant, savage creatures and the responsible, learned, civilized white man led to untold violence until the savage was disarmed and returned to its rightful place of servitude. A place where the savage could begin his climb from uselessness to at least some semblance of decency."
The Clansman,Bruce clark,"August 20, 2020",2.0,"A white supremacist's remake of Reconstruction and the rise of the KKK. The first part (of 4 parts) describes Washington D.C. immediately after Lee's surrender and depicts the jubilation in the Capital at war's end. Lincoln speaks to the book's main characters in excerpts from his documented orations. These chapters give an interesting personal view of the era.

The final 3 parts are set in South Carolina. The author has nothing but praise for Southern white women and the defeated Southern rebels, but nothing but disdain and horror for newly enfranchised blacks and Radical Republicans who take over state and local government.

The book is clearly a one-sided screed meant to boil Southerners' blood and justify the rise of the KKK.

The book, published in 1905, is the basis for D.W. Griffith's 1915 movie, ""Birth of a Nation."""
The Clansman,Heidi Bakk-Hansen,"December 28, 2020",2.0,"It's obviously horrifically racist propaganda, and a fever dream of white supremacy. However, it's worth reading in order to see the evolution (and persistence) of the language that is used by the racists to romance themselves into believing in that white supremacy. Honestly, this book sat on my reading table all year, and I basically powered through it so I didn't have to look at it anymore. It is an important product of its time (1905), written during the so-called Nadir of Race Relations, and inspiring so much terrorism in its wake. Reading it in the context of Black Lives Matter, it's a disgusting, awful read, but also necessary for a certain anti-racist education in the face of racist resurgence."
The Clansman,Brett Minor,"January 18, 2021",3.0,"It is difficult to review a book that was only written to perpetuate hatred. This book is racist to its core and that is despicable. I only read it because I often read the literature of the source material for radical views regardless of my own view. None of this is to be an endorsement. I hated everything this story was trying to teach.

However, the story had its compelling moments and scenes of tension. It was not torturing to read. Although, it was very apparent throughout that the author was not a talented writer. The only time he even attempted to weave any description into his narrative was when negatively describing the objects of his hatred."
The Clansman,Kim,"May 8, 2021",1.0,"This book is really only of historical interest, as it reflects the general racism of the era it was written in. I'm currently researching a book about D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation, which was based on this book, so I felt I should read it. As a novel it is not great, mainly because most of the characters are laughably two-dimensional - especially the saintly Southern women - and because Dixon's portrayal of blacks is dreadful. Also its claim to be a 'historical' romance is a full-on fraud. It's an ugly book. Don't read it unless you have to."
The Clansman,Jasmin,"November 21, 2021",,"Some people praise this book suggesting to try to not focus on the racist aspects. However, it is a racist novel and so, overlooking racism is not an option. I assume those who suggest overlooking racism are people who have no problem with the racist tones of this book, to begin with.

As for the novel, it sure is a product of its time. Read it the same evening I started, not because it's a good read but rather because I needed to get it over with and fast. It is so very American. I am very unimpressed."
The Clansman,Fabian,"March 8, 2023",3.0,"Even a book like this should never be banned! Why? Historical significance: Just witness the parallels between the devastation of the Civil War, the division between communities (along race lines more than anything), the drama made by offending privileged illiterates to the storming of the Capitol just a few years ago. The mindset of the enemy is crystalized quite brilliantly here. But the author is a sure as shit racist--described Black folk as inhuman, while the whites stumble upon romance and more romance, correctly living their fated blahness."
The Clansman,Keith,"June 23, 2020",1.0,"This book is entirely unrelated to its predecessor - The Leopard’s Spots - which was odd. It is quite obviously racist and intensely misguided, which is why I think it’s worth a read. It helps you see, or at least try to hear, how people think on the wrong side: what arguments they use to justify things. There really wasn’t anything worthy of note in this book, I just wanted to read the whole Reconstruction trilogy."
The Clansman,Cecil,"September 13, 2017",5.0,"Grand Wizardly Propaganda

This is an action packed book full of mean, evil, vile, and satanic descriptions of black Americans in an attempt, which it does very well, to glorify and justify the existence of the KKK."
The Chemistry of Tears,·Karen·,"April 18, 2012",5.0,"A hardback. I don't normally do hardbacks, but this was a birthday present to myself.

Hardbacks do feel nice though don't they? It's a pity the appearance of this one is spoilt by a really sappy cover picture that makes it look like a Tasteful Ladies' Romance. Which it is not. Needless to say.

I wish they'd used one of the perfectly splendiferous (false!) illustrations of Vaucanson's Duck:



Or this spiffy Drais:



Also needless to say it's bleeding brilliant, it is Peter Carey after all. Well, OK, he can turn in the occasional turkey, but this is a true swan, just as in the novel the ugly duckling turns out to be a beautiful swan. He's done that trick again of taking the historical and weaving it into the present in a way that illuminates both. This time it takes the form of a set of notebooks from 1854 that are found along with the various component parts of an automaton that Catherine, a horologist at London's Swinburne Museum, is to catalogue and reconstruct, a task given to her as a form of grief management. Carey points to the wonder of machines, how they can be the purest expression of all that is noble in the human mind; creativity and an ambitious desire to overcome our shortcomings, how they can comfort in their regularity and predictability, and yet at the same time they can be the portent of our demise, as illustrated by webcam images of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that pump through the pages. This idea of creating a facsimile of life that is so central to the whole story can also be seen as a metaphor for the process of writing a novel, so there's another level along with the question of reading, of owning a text, as we see Catherine reading Brandling's journal, indeed stealing it to do so, and being consumed by jealousy when she thinks that her assistant has had privileged access to what she felt was hers and hers alone. Who gets hold of the story and how that affects the truth.
And another thing that Carey does so well is that delicious wry humour. This is not nearly as exuberant as , it has to be more sombre as Catherine is in the most devastating form of grief. She has lost her married lover, suddenly and without even knowing, at first, how and where it happened. There is no comfort for her, no sympathetic hugs or process of leave-taking at the funeral. And yet she is more than a little ridiculous in her distraction, and bears more than a passing resemblance to the hapless Brandling, hilariously and pompously at sea in a culture and language that he does not understand. Indeed nearly every one of the characters is skeetering close to the edge of madness, toes on the edge of the abyss. Laughable and tragic, both.

And what is it that differentiates us from machines? Our bodies also function like a mechanical system, producing digestive juices and tears that contain hormones that reduce stress and act as a painkiller. That concentration on the illusion of life, the life-like quality of the mechanical swan's movement, brings into sharp focus where the difference lies: ""The skin is the largest sensory organ of the body. It contains more than four million receptors. It is our skin that lets us feel the gentle blowing of air, our lover caressing our body. Our skin experiences our reading too, or at least it did in my case: covering me in goose bumps as I read..."" Oh yes, me too, Mr Carey, me too.

And now that I've read and reviewed and dusted, this can go and join all the other Careys. At which point I see why I normally don't do hardbacks. They are too big to slot into the Billys that I have fitted out with extra shelves. Dang."
The Chemistry of Tears,Amy Warrick,"October 29, 2012",1.0,"Peter Carey, what is this??? You're all over the map here, nothing makes sense, nobody is likable, I am just...incapable of getting this book. It started out promising, woman gets over grief in re-assembling automaton, story of automaton told in alternate chapters, and then, it dissolves into pixels the way my DVR playback does sometimes.

I understand you're a genius and I thought we had a future. We are just too different.

p.s. loved Oscar & Lucinda"
The Chemistry of Tears,Annabel Smith,"April 30, 2012",2.0,"This novel seemed promising but never really reeled me in.

Catherine Gehrig, grief stricken at the death of her (secret)lover, throws herself into her work at a London museum, restoring an enormous complex automaton. Along the way she learns the story of Henry Brandling, who commissioned the design of the automaton for his dying son, a century earlier.

Neither Catherine nor Henry are particularly sympathetic characters. Catherine is prickly and difficult and though this is attributable to her grief, it didn't make me like her anymore. Henry is endearing, especially in his love for his child, but his story unfortunately becomes hijacked by the story of the automaton's creator, the annoying and verbose Sumper, whose own story also gets hijacked eventually by the story of Sumper's mentor. Which I found all rather dull.

There was some lovely writing - ""Henry's saw-tooth pen strokes had cut wormholes into time...Through one of these wormholes, as thin as a drinking straw, I had seen all that bright and poisonous invention"" - and I found the relationship between Catherine and her assistant dramatic and interesting to read.

But overall the book was just too cryptic for me. At one point Catherine muses on Henry Brandling's story: ""what was initially confusing would never be clarified no matter how you stared and swore at it. One learned to live with fuzziness and ambiguity"" But I'm afarid I did't learn to live with fuzziness and ambiguity. At the end of the book I understood that some epiphany had occurred but I didn't know what it was and I wasn't sufficently interested to re-read it and work it out. Which isn't really the mark of a great book, is it?"
The Chemistry of Tears,Phrynne,"May 30, 2014",1.0,"Having enjoyed Oscar and Lucinda I approached this book with interest and anticipation only to be really, really disappointed. To me it was a muddle of ideas, a lot of beautiful but meaningless prose and one of the worst endings I have ever read. I actually have no idea of what happened in the last few pages and have no inclination to go back and try to work it out. Carey is certainly an excellent writer but this particular book missed the point for me."
The Chemistry of Tears,Melody,"October 22, 2012",5.0,"I am usually so hard on books. I don't know why. But it doesn't take much to make me lop off a star. But this one I forgave, (although I didn't have to forgive much). I felt so protective of the characters and the story and forgave the fact that there are some things I still don't get.
This is a story of love and hope. Of the inherent good and evil in all things. Of connection. Of separation. Of the past and the present.
The automaton represents the beginning of the machine age. An invitation to taste the allure of oil. A beginning of an addiction. A beautiful, magical thing that belongs to Lucifer. A promise of a cure and a vow to bring a better life. As Catherine attempts to restore the duck or swan or whatever the diabolically perfect little machine is while also restoring her soul after losing her secret lover - a symbol of that dependency on oil spews its bile deep on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico, harming or killing all sea life in its path and inserting itself chemically and emotionally into the chain of all life.
Peter Carey. Sometimes I want to toss your books in that very oily Gulf you refer to. But this one I want to savor and study and talk about."
The Chemistry of Tears,Blair,"August 5, 2012",3.0,"The Chemistry of Tears is one of those typical literary novels: no surprise that it was already a favourite for the Booker before the longlist was even announced (although it didn't end up being nominated). It starts with Catherine Gehrig, a museum conservator, discovering that her long-term (married, secret) lover has died suddenly. Consumed with grief which she cannot allow the world to see, she immerses herself in a new project to restore a swan automaton. During this process, she discovers the notebooks of Henry Brandling - the man who commissioned the creation of the automaton for his ailing son in the 19th century - and becomes obsessed with Brandling's story. The narrative is split between Catherine's progress, both in restoring the swan and coming to terms with Matthew's death, and Henry's journals.

I found the segments of the narrative dealing with Catherine's grief by far the most interesting. Her love for Matthew was evoked with such painful clarity: it felt very real to me, as did Catherine as a character. In comparison, I found the sections relating to Henry troublesome and sometimes dull. Then there's the fact that, as absolutely with this type of book, everyone in the story is white and very, VERY privileged. I did get a bit fed up of references to everyone's wonderfully upper-class education and all the expensive designer things they owned after a while. And although I liked and empathised with Catherine, I did wonder why on earth, since (so we're told) Matthew was madly in love with her and his wife was habitually unfaithful, he wouldn't just have got divorced and been with Catherine properly?!

Like so many of its ilk, this was a novel I admired more than enjoyed. I thought it was beautifully written, and it held my interest, but the only thing about it that captivated me emotionally was Catherine's love for Matthew. Much of the rest of it left me cold, and I didn't really understand any of the other characters at all."
The Chemistry of Tears,Julie,"July 4, 2012",2.0,"Well.

I will allow that this is probably an excellent book, written by an excellent author. Other reviews have noted that it might have been better to have read it with a book club, as insights would be gained by the comments of other readers.

That comment does make me feel a bit better, because I must admit to being thoroughly confused throughout most of this book. And, that is just not why I pick up a book to read. I like to understand what is going on in a story, I don't enjoy wondering what just happened....what that meant.....

I have never read anything by this author. I picked this book out of the library because it sounded like a good tale. I knew absolutely nothing about automatons. Maybe it would have helped if I did, but since I don't understand how the simplest machines work, all the detail on the ""mysterium tremendum"" was lost on me! And, Catherine didn't grieve in a way I could empathise with. Her most secret affair was not secret after all, so she did have someone to talk with. She chose not to. So utterly consumed with love, why didn't they marry?? Someone who had worked in preservation her whole life would fling an antiquity across the room?? Why was she so sad while deleting his emails?? He had sent them all to her, hadn't he? Wouldn't everything received and everything send be on her own computer??

See? It is small stuff like this that just didn't fly. But, since he is a prize winning author, I must conclude that I just am not up to the task of reading and enjoying his books. Task?? Reading, to me, isn't supposed to be a task. Reading this book, while I did enjoy parts and soooo wanted to know what was going to be the final outcome, just wasn't satisfying. Am I the only person who wished to know if the duck that turned into a swan cured Percy?? I wanted to know that a lot more than I wanted to have it pointed out to me that machines may result in the extermination of mankind as we know it.

There. My conclusion--this guy writes wonderful books that I don't enjoy reading. But.....maybe......I will try another..... :-)"
The Chemistry of Tears,Teresa,"July 25, 2022",3.0,"3 and 1/2 stars

I read Carey's ""Oscar and Lucinda"" with an online group many years ago and I'm wishing I could've done the same with this, my second of his novels. Though I recognize his many merits, I'm just not sure Carey is for me.

I was reminded of Oscar as I read about Henry. Both are men who find themselves on a strange journey in a strange place due to an obsession, obsessions that border on madness and have to do with the building of a folly at the intersection of Art and Science. Henry is not the only one with an obsession, however. The past and present are full of obsessors.

I alternated between liking and not liking the voices Carey used for his main characters. I didn't like Catherine's and then I did. I liked Henry's and then I didn't, but that may have been because Sumper's voice (through Henry) basically takes over Henry's at many points, and I found Sumper, for the most part, boring -- but isn't that the case with obsessors we are forced to listen to? -- even Henry tells us he is bored with Sumper. I admired the flawless construction when Carey mixed Catherine's voice with Henry's.

I think I would've benefited from reading this book with a group, being able to bat around ideas, of which there are many -- especially when it came to the ending, which I thought was brilliantly written and yet I'm still not sure what it all means.

And even though Carey may not be for me, I still intend to read his ""Jack Maggs."""
The Chemistry of Tears,Sarah,"March 2, 2013",2.0,"Well, that was disappointing.

I love the title. I love the premise. I thought this would be dark, and quirky, and funny, and poignantly sad. I thought I'd be drawn into the world of an eccentric genius. Instead, I feel as though I was cornered by a tedious drunk who monologues, gets lost asides, and reiterates the same point over, and over, and over again. By the end, I wasn't even paying attention. I was nodding politely and edging my way to the door.

But I finished it...more or less."
The Chemistry of Tears,Peter,"December 16, 2015",4.0,"The Chemistry of Tears is the story of an horologist, Catherine Gehrig, who works in a small London museum. Her lover, Matthew, one of the museum other curators, has just died suddenly and she is distraught. To take her mind off her grief her boss gives her a new job, to restore a mysterious automaton, which may or may not be a replica of Vaucanson's Duck. It arrives in her studio in eight gigantic tea-chests and amongst the myriad of broken parts she finds the diaries of its former owner, a Victorian Lord named Henry Brandling. Henry Brandlings son is dying of consumption and he has promised to build the boy an automaton. So he sets out on a journey to the Black Forests of Germany in pursuit of this goal. As the story goes on the repair of the automaton and also its creation run in tandem and, reading about the people who made the creature, Catherine begins to feel more and more connected with them.

I listened to this as an audiobook and the performances of the two actors as the two narrators was very good. The worst thing I can say about this book is that I don't particularly like the title: The Chemistry of Tears. I can see how it subtly relates to the content and it is explained in the book, but it also reminded me of this fun article in the Guardian about how book titles in literary fiction are somewhat interchangeable...

Peter Carey has a beautiful turn of phrase and all the characters, especially the German clockmaker and his son, are brilliantly drawn. The story itself is a little slight and I wanted things to develop with a few exciting sub-plots, and more of an ending, but really it is not that kind of book. Despite its fairy tale feel it stays in the realms of literary fiction and doesn't stray at all into fantasy and in the end it is an engaging book about grief and loss and how making art is an attempt to somehow capture life."

The Chemistry of Tears,Angela Elizabeth,"February 22, 2012",1.0,"Disappointing for the latest book from such a significant writer. I've never been much of a fan of Carey, but this book is is even more disappointing than I expected. I was hopeful I would love it, as the subject matter was right up my alley. The plot is wonderful, a gift for any author - following the death of her secret lover, a antique watchmaker and antiquities specialist at the British museum is forced to grieve in complete silence lest her secret be discovered, until she learns some friends already know and are her willing allies, whisking her away to a quiet warehouse where she may grieve in private and work on a mysterious new piece to take her mind off things. Great! I loved the character and wanted to know how she would survive. When she discovers a secret journal among the boxes in which her mystery object is packed, the mystery deepens and a wonderful new character is introduced to the novel. Unfortunately, this is where it all begins to go wrong! Had Carey focused on these characters, telling their stories and interweaving their private grief, this would have been a wonderful novel. But instead, Carey digresses and introduces a plethora of new characters the point of whom I still fail to fathom. The novel starts off wonderfully, but unfortunately, Carey loses his way. I hate to see a good idea go to waste - this one could have been great!"
The Chemistry of Tears,Julia,"March 24, 2012",5.0,"I am not usually a fan of Peter Carey, but this is the first book I have ever read that I wanted to start reading again immediately I finished it (and I think I need to, now I have read the ending). I will not write here what the book is ""about"", as it has been written already in enough reviews and so it would be redundant. But what other reviewers have said the book is about, ie obsession, grief, etc, is what it is about on the surface. I am astounded only one other reviewer has noted another aspect of this, the deeper aspect. The clue is in the ending, where Catherine asks herself ""am I too stupid to see this is a critique of the industrial revolution?"". And there is your answer to the book. Every reader should ask themselves the same question.

Peter Carey juxtaposes the incredibly beautiful silver swan (go to youtube and find the Silver Swan at the Bowes Museum--it is the exact silver swan Carey's swan is based on) against the horrors of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. He shows how machinery can produce such beauty, but at the same time be able to be responsible for killing us all; destroying the planet. That perhaps there is an element of Lucifer in where we have taken machinery today. In other words ""look where the industrial revolution has taken us"". It also asks questions about humans and souls--like the protaginist in Hugo (the film) finds out--humans are not just part of the machinery, cogs in the clockwork, to keep things going. What is the soul? (because we can't see it... another clue in the book, engraved on the swan's beak and ranted about by Sumper!) How do we feel emotions?

In my opinion, after reading this book, Peter Carey IS a genius. I bow down to him.

(PS--you can also find the Vaucanson Duck, reproduced and working, on youtube.)"
The Chemistry of Tears,Ron Charles,"December 15, 2013",2.0,"Peter Carey’s new novel is about robots. I think. And grief. Yes, I’m positive it’s got something to do with grief. And art restoration, computers and global warming. And possibly space aliens, but don’t quote me on that. The Australian two-time Booker winner, who lives in New York, is one of my all-time favorite novelists. For more than 30 years, he’s published dazzlingly smart stories about con artists and fanatics with deceptions nested inside confusion tied up with madness. But his latest novel pulls those strings of madness a little too tight to unpack. It took me back to A.S. Byatt’s “” (2003), he scanned the slippery lines of a fraudulent poem; in “Theft” (2006), he swirled through the palette of art forgery. In “The Chemistry of Tears,” his heroine picks through hundreds of corroded springs, tarnished silver rings and glass rods gunked up with old glue. Descended from a line of clockmakers, she’s a horologist who could recognize the angle of Whitworth screw threads since she was 10. She quickly realizes that the pieces she’s charged with reassembling compose something like the mechanical digesting duck that Jacques de Vaucanson constructed in the mid-18th century. Or they may hold the evidence to humanity’s impending destruction. Or I may have been snacking on too many paint chips from an old windowsill.

In any case, the key to this historical, mechanical and possibly metaphysical mystery is 11 faded notebooks found among the decrepit machine parts. The peculiar style of the handwriting convinces Catherine “that the writer had been driven mad,” which sounds a little crazy itself, but hang on. Violating the museum’s rules (and common sense), she takes these notebooks home and begins reading the remarkable tale of a wealthy young man named Henry Brandling. In 1854, Henry got it into his head that only a replica of Vaucanson’s duck could cheer up his sickly little boy, so he traveled to Germany in search of a clockmaker capable of re-creating such a machine. (The logic of that motivation may be the rustiest spring in this novel.)

As Catherine slowly reconstructs the automaton in her modern-day workshop, alternating chapters take us back into the Black Forest, where Henry has employed a manic, and possibly murderous, genius. The mysterious manuscript, the increasingly bizarre picaresque voyage, and the grotesque characters Henry meets along the way are all classic Carey tropes, and very quickly several fascinating themes start to shoot and snort out of this Rube Goldberg plot.

Catherine notes that “it was highly ‘inappropriate’ to give a grieving woman that task of simulating life.” But like us, she can’t resist wanting to see what this thing can do. The violation of that line between animate and inanimate haunts her, just as it disturbs Henry in his journal. They both know the way grief drives us toward inventions that can’t satisfy the heart. “Really, truly,” she thinks, “anyone who has ever observed a successful automaton, seen its uncanny lifelike movements, confronted its mechanical eyes, any human animal remembers that particular fear, that confusion about what is alive and what cannot be born.” Dr. Frankenstein to the aviary — stat!

Henry realizes too late that he’s employed a craftsman who has something much more radical in mind than a mechanical duck. Is it blasphemous to create such artificial life? And is 19th-century Germany a safe place to be scratching at superstitions? As the gears of this story start to spin, I worried about losing a finger amid all the flying parts: the Brothers Grimm, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Charles Babbage’s calculating machine, the internal combustion engine, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, global warming, Prince Albert, extraterrestrial life.

Don’t worry, I literally can’t give away this plot. . . .

Amid the smoke of mysticism rising from these pages, how reassuring it is to come upon Catherine’s complaint that “the account was filled with violent and disconcerting ‘jump cuts.’ . . . In fact, you soon learned that what was initially confusing would never be clarified no matter how you started and swore at it. One learned to live with fuzziness and ambiguity in a way one never would in life.”

That warning should be printed on the spine of “The Chemistry of Tears” for anyone tempted to peer into this “sea of ambiguity, delusion, wonder, possibility, amongst all the murk and confusion.” No other popular literary author is so wily — so willful about letting us remain in the fog. That confusion can be intoxicating, but several things make all this more frustrating than engaging. First, the plot has none of the steam-engine propulsion we’re used to in Carey’s novels. Shiny things twirl here, but they don’t go anywhere. And thematically, the story is full of feints and dead-ends meant to make us admit the limits of our humble vision. (Uncle!)

Finally, what Carey can create like no one else are rough, hypnotic voices. The scoundrel in “,” the servant in “Parrot and Olivier in America” — each one is a larynx constructed of ink and paper. But, ironically for a novel all about artificial life, Carey can’t seem to pull off his signature magic. Henry and his mad clockmaker have their moments, yes, but Catherine’s grief is so extravagant and arch that we can see the pulleys and wires beneath her skin. No one reading these pages will ever scream, “It’s alive !”

The brilliant parts of this novel make it sound like another Carey masterpiece, but sometimes even though a thing walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s not."
The Chemistry of Tears,WJ,"May 26, 2013",1.0,"The Chemistry of Tears is the first book by Peter Carey that I've tried to read. I said 'tried to read' because I actually didn't manage to finish the book. I found the blurb to be quite interesting although I didn't know much about automatons, museum work or about nineteenth century Germany. I wanted to find out more about how Henry and Catherine's two worlds will be linked and was fully prepared to be sympathetic towards Catherine.

However, didn't work out the way I expected. Catherine's said to have been a logical, calm person but her lover's death has unraveled her and made her into an emotional wreck. Indeed she was absolutely awful to everyone, even her boss who's tried to help her find a placement in the Annexe where she will not have to face her other colleagues. Instead she grumbles and moans about the Annexe and doesn't appreciate how kind he has been to her. The affair doesn't appear to have been as well-hidden as the blurb suggests because her boss knows all about it. In fact it wasn't as though Catherine did not have a confidante about her affair, she could have spoken to her boss who had been very understanding about the whole thing.

I was willing to put aside Catherine's horrible attitude because I did like Henry's story. His total belief and fervor regarding the duck and how it would help his son to feel better was incredibly sad because he was simply grasping at the straws. His adventure and mis-communication with the Germans was far more compelling than Catherine's emotional mess and her attitude. However, his story soon took a weird turn as well. I didn't understand anything that was happening between him and the Germans and when that new character appeared and offered to help him, I was so fed up that I really couldn't care about these characters anymore.

There are a few things that I look out for in every book that I read: compelling storyline, characters that I can feel empathetic about and good writing. had already failed on the first two accounts, seeing as how I didn't like Catherine very much and after a while, couldn't care about Henry's adventure to commission the automaton for his son. In terms of writing, Peter Carey has crafted a confusing tale. I didn't understand what was going on most of the time (and it wasn't for the want of effort).

I wished I could have enjoyed far more and that I could have found it in me to finish the book. Unfortunately I don't think it's something that I will return to and I doubt that I will read another book by Peter Carey again."
The Chemistry of Tears,David,"April 28, 2019",4.0,"Chemistry of Tears by Peter Carey

Whatever you read by Peter Carey, you will find pleasurable, intellectually stimulating and perhaps consciousness raising. I found Chemistry of Tears mainly of the latter two qualities, and I found that I had to add the third attribute, because I began to feel that I did in fact in some way raise or deepen my understanding of the perception of things.

Peter Carey is a master creator, a superb artist. Language for him serves as a tool to explore meticulously the problems encountered by humans who are intent on purpose. As I read the novel, I felt like the words glittered off the page like surgical instruments while staring into a bright light of truth. I know that what I just said evokes the image of the reader sitting in a dentist’s chair, but what I mean is that there is a realization that Carey’s use of language seems surgical in nature and you do see glints and reflections accentuated by light in your thoughts.

His novel is told in two separate voices—Catherine’s and Henry Brandling's. She is a horologist who works for a museum and is mourning the loss of her lover, and Brandling is a German from perhaps 150 years before who is trying to cure his son. This odd coupling is handled deftly.

You find yourself feeling empathy for the characters in two different countries and cultures in two different eras of European history, but both focussed on the same thing for different reasons.

There is some mystery but really the tension is held by Catherine’s coping with her grief and Henry’s frustration at obtaining an unusual cure for his son.

By the way, there is an interesting reference at the end about the title."
The Chemistry of Tears,Carol Meissner,"December 25, 2013",1.0,"""Not worth reading…""
Great! How exciting to write a negative review of a book others seem to love. And how annoying! The main character is someone I would never want to know. She is a woman who has been the lover of a man for thirteen years but thinks no one knew of their relationship. Catherine is egotistical and manic. For a ""mature"" woman to behave with the poor judgment she displays toward one who is kind, over and over again, is rephrehensible. Catherine acts like a baby. She drinks, snorts cocaine and feels sorry for herself. Frankly, as a woman, it was easy to tell that the author was a man. Catherine is a caricature of how a man might see a woman in such a position. And, if that is not bad enough, another woman is added to the plot and she is equally crazy and unlikeable. Follow that with a bizarre secondary story about a mechanical contraption and surely you will understand the title. No? Well, that's what is supposed to be so innocuous, right? Hardly. Avoid at all costs or prepare to be irritated."
The Chemistry of Tears,Jeanette,"October 29, 2017",3.0,"This book reveals the slightly off centre mastery and vivid imagination that is Peter Carey. The read follows 2 time lines, one 1854 to relative present day. Sometimes this type of writing can be difficult to keep up with, however in the scenes of this book this isn’t the case even with the story revolving around an “automata” with Carey taking from history, 1743 Jacques Vaucanson. The reader will recognise that both the main characters are desperate with their separate losses and loneliness but the one aspect for me was that I was totally frustrated with both of them. Catherine Gehrig really needs to seek a grief therapist and for Henry Brandling probably one not available in 1854 but a priest may have helped.
The whole ridiculousness of the saga that Henry finds himself in with Herr Sumper while in Furtwangen, Black Forest region becomes a little quotidianly boring. Carey in the end borrows again a tiny bit from history inferring little Carl becomes a famous identity (Google check that reference Karl Benz of Karlsruhe). Present day, (a small mistakes with present day timeline 2010 /2011 does no one do a double check) with Catherine who seemingly has enjoyed a positive life and good job is unable to deal with the death of her lover, breaks all the rules while falling more and more out of control."
The Chemistry of Tears,Em H.,"April 21, 2013",2.0,"I really wanted to like this book. I should love this book, as the blurb on the back makes it sound exactly like the sort of novel I would not only pick up to read once, but return to again and again.

Sadly, this is not the case.

The book centers around Catherine Gehrig, a conservator at a London museum, who tries to deal with the grief of losing her lover. As she grapples with this grief, her boss entrusts her with a mechanical bird he wants her to restore. The crates bearing the different parts also include a set of ten notebooks written by the man who commissioned the bird to be built for his ill son. The reader, then, gets chapters from the point-of-view of Catherine, the man (Henry Brandling), and a mixture of the two. As the back of the book states, ""Through the clockwork bird, Henry and Catherine will confront the mysteries of creation, the power of human invention, and the body's astonishing chemistry of love and feeling."" Sounds awesome, right?

The book had so much potential. Its first mistake comes from the fact that the mechanical bird, easily the most interesting aspect of the novel, becomes completely overshadowed by domestic issues. There is far less of the restoration process and an excess of Catherine's problems, which I really couldn't be bothered to care about. I had a difficult time connecting with Catherine. Henry was quite a charming character, and I thought his motivation to construct the bird was endearing, but both of them could use more complexity behind their actions. Soon enough, how they felt just became repetitious and I stopped seeing character growth. As someone who adores character novels, I would have liked the novel more if the characters had been given more room to grow. This was a character novel, but not a well executed one.

The level of absurdity within the novel was maddening, as well. I can't begin to understand the motives behind Eric (who needs a hobby so he stops interfering with other people's business) and Amanda. Neither of them made any sense to me at all and their actions constantly disoriented me and took me out of the novel.

I enjoyed the fairy tale aspect of the novel, but it could have been built up a bit more. Some of the prose was also quite beautiful and clear.

What ultimately maddened me the most and is the reason I only gave the novel two stars was the end. I felt that the text hadn't earned the last twenty or so pages. The question of human existence and other worlds hadn't been prevalent throughout the novel, then it was suddenly shoved into the narration and made to be this huge deal. It wasn't clear what it brought to the overall story arch and what its purpose was within the space of the novel. Were there interesting questions brought up? Yes. These questions weren't developed, though, and could have been developed a lot better.

Thus, not a book I enjoyed. It's tolerable at parts, but holistically there are far too many character and plot holes to make me want to read this book again."
The Chemistry of Tears,Lisa,"January 20, 2016",4.0,"Clockwork is a fascinating concept to weave through a story in the digital age. I am old enough to remember winding my first watch but it is many years now since I have had anything other than a digital watch. If I put my mind to considering whether our household has any clockwork mechanisms at all, all I can come up with is a (somewhat twee) Christmas decoration featuring Santa on a music-box merry-go-round and our (rather unreliable) 1930s mantel clock. That’s probably typical of most households today. Clockwork has been relegated to the realm of museums, antiques, and nostalgia.

But in a splendid return to the dazzling form which produced Oscar and Lucinda, Peter Carey’s new novel, The Chemistry of Tears, is a deliciously eccentric tale of obsession, centring on clockwork, and grief.

Hidden grief is probably more common than we know. In Carey’s tale, Catherine Gehrig is The Other Woman, trying to grieve in secret for Matthew Tinsdale who, until his untimely death, is her colleague and lover at London’s ‘Swinburne Museum’. No one else knew about their affair, (or so she thought) so she tries to deal with her loss without any of the support that a grieving widow could take for granted. She can’t attend the funeral. She receives no consolatory sympathy cards. None of the stilted, awkward words of well-meaning friends ease her way through the raw passage of grief through the human heart.

But it is Carey writing this novel, so Catherine’s journey is anything but dignified. Naughty man, he makes his readers smile, chuckle, and laugh out loud at poor Catherine’s antics. An obsessive and controlling personality, she is well-suited to her job as the first female horologist at the museum, but try as she might, her efforts to behave as an unfeeling mechanical creature are sabotaged by the madness of her overwhelming grief.

The Chemistry of Tears,"Marialyce (absltmom, yaya)","May 23, 2012",2.0,"In two words...very disappointing. I have read and enjoyed two other novels by Peter Carey and was looking forward to this book as well. Although it started out intriguing with a man, a woman, and an automaton, and the meaning of love in its states of that of a father for his son and a woman for her lover, it ended without an ending as our author seemed to lose his way frustrating this reader.

Catherine, the protagonist is overwhelmed with grief as she tries to cope with the loss of her married lover. She is given the job of ""giving life"" back to an automaton"" a duck/swan and while doing so, reads the journals of a man who lived in the 1800's who was instrumental in the automaton's beginnings, a man who wants it made to give his ailing son enjoyment by giving this ""gift"" of this swan to his dying son. Henry, the father to this boy, for reasons unknown travels to the Black Forest where he employs a ""crazy"" genius to build this ""toy."" The chapters alternate between Catherine and Henry.

Along the way there are suggestions of aliens, the resurrection of Christ, the BP oil spill, and Charles Babbage. It seemed as if Mr Carey put together a bunch of events and then sorted them into a quasi story which in the end just does not pull together. I do understand that basically this was a story of grief and even rage, but hard as I tried, I just could not work up enough of anything be it caring, frustration, or even interest to find the meaning that I am sure Mr Carey wanted me to find. I was grateful that the book, written beautifully by the way, was short, for I feel that Mr Carey and I would have parted company long before the last page was done."
The Chemistry of Tears,Elizabeth,"October 29, 2012",1.0,"If you like whiny adultresses whose lover has died and indirect storytelling lapsing into bizarre unwelcome philosophizing then this is the book for you. In the beginning I disliked the adulteress living in current times but I liked the journal entries written by a 19th century man. Then, as the story progressed and the man was confused by his interactions with the German townspeople where he hoped to have an automaton built and those interactions were never explained and instead the man's journal became more difficult to understand, I began to dislike the man too. I have no interest in attempting to fill in blanks that poor storytelling leaves behind. Lines like ""you ... are in the same state as a fly whose microscopic eye has been changed to one similar to a man's,"" and ""YOU ARE WHOLLY UNABLE TO ASSOCIATE WHAT YOU SEE WITH WHAT YOUR LIFE HAS TAUGHT YOU,"" are unhelpful and what's with the capitalization? Dude, if I wanted to read something metaphysical, I would choose something from the self help section or the religious section. I only finished the book because it was so short. I kept checking the page numbers to see how many more to go before I could write this review. Perhaps I am ""WHOLLY UNABLE TO ASSOCIATE WHAT YOU SEE WITH WHAT YOUR LIFE HAS TAUGHT YOU"" but if so, I am happy in my ignorance and happy to never read another piece of drivel like this."
The Chemistry of Tears,Lindz,"December 4, 2015",3.0,"My first Peter Carey was like eating Vegemite on fluffy sour bread toast, with melted butter. Vegemite is an acquired taste, salty, yeasty, fermented goodness. Carey has managed to toast the bread (Vegemite always tastes better on white bread) just right, grazed with heat, soft in the middle. Smothered with butter, then he dusts Vegemite light over, Carey managed to do this skilfully spread the yeast, lightly where needed, and larded it where needed. But not to much - every Vegemite connoisseur knows, never put too much on the tongue, it is not worth it.

Carey is obviously an incredibly intelligent skilful writer. I'm not entirely sure I understand the strange world of 'Chemistry of Tears', with it's story of loss, grief, technology, clock making gangsters, mechanical frankenstein creations, and high minded insanity. I'm not sure all the clogs fit together, but I still have the taste of Carey's prose on my tongue, and it is exquisite.

I am going to get me some Vegemite on toast."
The Chemistry of Tears,Adam,"July 1, 2013",4.0,"I enjoyed Peter Carey's Parrot and Olivier in America in which the author tells an interesting tale using two separate 'voices', those of the two protagonists named in the title. The Chemistry of Tears also uses the same formula, but with a difference. The result is the narration of a peculiar adventure using a fascinating interweaving of two connected plots.

One of the voices speaks to us from times long past, the other from a woman rather than a man (ie the author). Thus, Carey set himself a fascinating challenge: to convince the reader that he or she is experiencing both the past and also that a woman is 'speaking' to him or her.

Catherine, who works as a clock restorer in a small London museum, is in mourning for her recently deceased lover, a married man who also worked in the museum. Catherine's superior, Croft, is the only person who knew about this illicit relationship. He feels sorry for her, and gives her a new project to try to distract her from her grief. He leaves a number of crates in her office, and tells her to tackle the project when she feels up to it. She begins almost immediately.

The crates contain the dismantled components of an automaton built during the mid-19th century. They also contain a manuscript written by Henry Brandling, who commissioned the construction of this mechanical toy to entertain his ailing son.

Henry, writing in the 1850s, narrates what happened when he went to Germany to find a clock-maker capable of manufacturing what will turn out to be an extremely ingenious device. Chapters from his curious and somewhat sinister narrative alternate with Catherine's account of her life and problems that occur whilst she pieces together the extraordinary automaton.

Henry Brandling speaks from the past in language that makes one believe that the manuscript was actually written in the 1850s. This ability to make me convinced that I am hearing words from history whilst I read is what particularly appeals to me about Carey's historical writing.

In portraying Catherine's thoughts, Carey puts himself into a woman's shoes, so to speak. While he uses her voice successfully to advance a thrilling story, I am not really sure that I was convinced that I was reading words written by a woman. Nevertheless, this novel is original, intriguing, and highly enjoyable."

The Chemistry of Tears,Nikki in Niagara,"August 2, 2012",3.0,"Reason for Reading: Peter Carey's True History of the Kelley Gang is one of my all time favourite books and I've always meant to read another by the author. With this latest book coming out, the time period and the automata piqued my interest enough to decide to give him another go at this time.

I'm not even going to try and analyze just what the hidden, under the surface meanings are in this story, there are plenty but it gives me a headache looking at this book that way. I just want to read it and enjoy a good story. Read it I did but I only found a mediocre story. We start off on the first page meeting the main character, an adulteress, with no redeeming qualities. Her married lover has just died and she is totally wrapped up in herself. She has no cares for his children, whom he loved dearly and we learn that she often was jealous of them. She is quite younger than this man and her life seems to have existed for their relationship together, and her job as an horologist at a museum secondly. That's all, no friends, no family. Catherine, or Cat, as she is commonly called is given a project to restore to help her with her grief by the only person at the museum who knew about her affair.

The text alternates between Catherine in the present dealing with her grief, possessiveness and selfishness as she becomes somewhat obsessive over the automata that she and a young assistant, whom she dislikes and distrusts, are working on. Cat is also reading through the ledgers/journals that came packed with the assemblage which gives us the other view. Henry Blanding tells his story set in the 1850s of how he came to a strange little German town and had an even stranger man build his clockwork duck for him. His journal is written to his young son whom he promised this prized possession in hopes that it would make him well, as he is a sickly boy, most likely consumptive. Henry also is not a rather likable fellow. His wife has refused relations with him, denied to care for their son, since their first child, a daughter died the same way. She is loveless to them and Henry is pathetic in his attempts to be all and do all for this cold woman who brings in an artistic crowd to their house to have her portraits painted. Henry is eventually persuaded to leave the house, his search to make the automata his pretence for leaving. While unlike Catherine, Henry does slowly change throughout the book, for the most part he is a weak man, easily taken advantage of, of superior mind of course being an Englishman, and emotionally volatile.

There is more to say, but I shan't go on. The basic plot of the two stories was entertaining to read, the writing naturally superb, and I had no problem getting though the book quickly; I'm sure its short length helped matters though. But I had no connection to any of the characters, not liking them, nor caring what happened to them in the end. Not everyone is sane in this story and it's up to the reader to decide who is or isn't sane. Perhaps they are all off their rockers. The ending does little to satisfy this reader."
The Chemistry of Tears,Robotbee,"August 31, 2012",5.0,"I bought this book as a birthday gift for a friend, for whom I initially had felt very clever buying 'The People of the Book.' Turns out she already had it, bless my eavesdropping heart.

Well, I had read a review of 'The Chemistry of Tears' that was sent to me by Amazon.com, which is terrifyingly good at guessing what I will like, and it occurred to me that my friend, who is not only Jewish and generally artsy (hence 'the People of the Book') but also, more specifically, has spent time interning and working in an art history museum, would probably appreciate 'The Chemistry of Tears,' which tells its story from the perspective of a restoration specialist devastated by the loss of a secret lover.

I treated myself to a read of the book before wrapping it, justified by her being on vacation as well as (ostensibly) a desire to pre-screen the book for content and quality. I was surprised by the parallels between this book and 'The People of the Book.' Besides the obvious, the presence of an artifact on which the characters focus and around which most of the action revolves, the two books are also similar structurally, incorporating the history of the artifact into the story of the contemporary protagonist using alternating chapters. In addition, both also associate the personal progress of the contemporary narrator with her progress with the artifact, and correlate the emotional journey of individuals involved in the history of the artifact with the emotional journey of the contemporary protagonist.

I was proud to give this book as a gift, and am eager to find out what she thinks of it.

To the rest of you, I recommend this book to anyone who liked 'The People of the Book,' and 'The People of the Book' to anyone who liked this book.

If you liked this book primarily for its structure, try 'The Monsters of Templeton' and 'The Thirteenth Tale.' Much more fictiony and less serious, but good."
The Chemistry of Tears,Janet,"July 7, 2012",2.0,"Cover synopsis: ""An automaton, a man and a woman who can never meet, a secret love story, and the fate of the warming world are all brought to incandescent life in this hauntingly moving novel from one of the finest writers of our time."" Sounds absolutely irresistible, right? Especially irresistible when one is standing in Schiphol Airport clasping a dead Kindle. Ultimately, not only resistible but unsatisfying.

Told in two arcs spanning 150 years with occasional intersection. The problem is the main characters, Catherine and Henry have all the depth of robots - wind them up and they move a little, very little. She's superficial and shrill; he's single-minded but befuddled. Both are surrounded by a cast of implausible characters. A blue cube, lost blueprints, Karl Benz, some intrigue surrounding Queen Victoria and if that isn't enough to make your eyes glass over the 'hit you over the head with a 2x4' references to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may do the trick. I concede most might find this all very heady stuff and thought-provoking but I just felt manipulated and annoyed.

Carey is a terrific writer but this isn't his best work."
The Chemistry of Tears,Holly,"August 13, 2016",4.0,"Really enjoyed reading this - and how very strange it is. I commiserate with Ron Charles in the Washington Post who said:
As the gears of this story start to spin, I worried about losing a finger amid all the flying parts: the Brothers Grimm, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Charles Babbage’s calculating machine, the internal combustion engine, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, global warming, Prince Albert, extraterrestrial life.

Add to that a meditation on grief, an unfolding mystery that may or may not be resolved, an illustration of the mechanistic vs. organic worldviews, an message about the ambivalence of the Industrial Revolution, and perhaps a comment on the morality of fairy-tales?

Strange that the LOC listing names ""Henry Brandling"" as a real personage, but I cannot find a record of him; perhaps it should have read Karl Benz?

The Chemistry of Tears,Julia,"September 24, 2012",4.0,"While there tends to be an OVERDOSE of ""tears"" in the book, I found myself drawn to the alternating narrators.

She finds, along with all the mechanical parts of an automaton, the notebooks of Henry Brandling, the mid 19th century owner of the contents of the chests.

The books continues by alternating chapters between Catherine and Henry, whose story of how the automaton came into being carries the reader into the grief of a father trying to entertain an ill son. Henry's LONG travels into the clockwork makers of Germany are recounted in the notebooks, which Catherine reads avidly.

The watchmaker he finds, Sumper, isn't interested in Henry's mundane request for a duck automaton that can eat and defecate. He envelopes Henry in the Grimm's fairytale atmosphere of the Black Forest and is almost a bully, telling Henry that Sumper will build him something much grander than a duck, and sharing with Henry the vision of Sumper's mentor, Cruickshank (a character clearly modeled on the great Charles Babbage,whose prototype computer, the Difference Engine, has been reconstructed at the Science Museum in London).

Here's a quote from Andrew Miller's review in the NY Times, May 25, 2012:

""It is here, perhaps, in the watchmaker’s hallucinogenic parable, that we come to what Carey is playing with in this novel: the illusory versus the actual, the mechanical versus the organic. The gap, if any, between that which, in its complexity, imitates life, and that which is living and may possess something else, something that isn’t simply part of the works. A soul! Carey, of course, isn’t going to come down on one side or the other of this venerable debate. Instead, he puts into the mouth of Catherine’s boss the still persuasive Romantic plea for ambiguity, for the power and beauty of mysteries, for defending these from “analytical clarities.” The closing scenes, in which Catherine and her young assistant finally recreate what Henry Brandling brought back from the forest, are among the best in the book, and the moment when it — the not-a-duck — is set in motion is thrilling.""

That last sentence is so true--the closing scenes made the entire book worth the read! I was entranced to find youtube entries of the silver swan automaton at the Bowes Museum in England--well worth the sight! When Mark Twain saw the swan at the World's Fair in Paris in 1867, he exclaimed:

""I watched the Silver Swan, which had a living grace about his movement and a living intelligence in his eyes-watched him swimming about as comfortably and unconcernedly as it he had been born in a morass instead of a jeweller’s shop - watched him seize a silver fish from under the water and hold up his head and go through the customary and elaborate motions of swallowing it...""

The idea of the automaton (also the center of THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET) left me wondering if humans now have the ability, with cloning, to create biological automatons--and THEN the question of whether THOSE constructs have ""souls"" becomes even more poignant."
The Chemistry of Tears,mussolet,"April 5, 2015",5.0,"I have spent almost six months with this 270 page novel, because I used it as a ""handbag book"". In one way or another, its characters have been on my mind constantly. Maybe this is why I can relate to the book so easily now, maybe I wouldn't have responded the way I did had I read it in one sitting. It is a different experience when you read half a chapter on a train journey and then wonder at every traffic light how your chapter might continue.

This book fits me well - there are automatons, which I love, there is German history and landscape, which is superb, there is great writing, which is apparently obvious because it is Peter Carey (I can't comment, I've never read one of his books before), and there is a young woman who doesn't really know where she's going in her life, especially now that her married lover has died and she has been given a seemingly useless assignment at work.

Both protagonist Catherine and Henry, whose journals she reads, are interesting characters. Again I don't know whether this is a result of how long I spent with this book, but I felt like leaving good friends after I'd finished the book. They have quirks, they have flaws, and they feel very human. Catherine is very alone in her grief for her lover - she cannot even attend his funeral -, and she closely guards Henry's writings, acting jealous everytime anyone else seems to interfere. She takes on the job of restoring the automaton only very reluctantly, feeling that she has been cast off. But as she lets herself sink deeper and deeper into Henry's world, she sees the gift that is her work. And the reader can see the danger that lies in machines mankind wants to bring to life.

I have a thing for automatons in novels; they always tell you a lot about the humans that deal with them, about the state and potential of technology, and about the omnipresent power of storytelling as well. Automatons are always created and restored for a reason; no one makes something so complex just for the sake of it, and it is fascinating to see what can motivate people to do such enormous deeds, even though they fail to understand the consequences of their actions.

Like I've said a lot of times in this review, this book has basically become an extension of me, and so it is nearly impossible for me to rate this. Although I personally feel that five stars and a recommendation are extraordinarily objective :).

The Chemistry of Tears,Tweedledum,"November 5, 2016",4.0,"I don't think I can compete with the detailed and insightful positive reviews that have been posted but I would like to say something.



One reviewer spoke of the dreamlike feel of the book and this seems a helpful way of thinking. Catherine is in that half life state that grief can put you in. Everything is intensified because of this and seems slightly unreal yet her years of expertise guide her hands and observations. Henry too is in a state of suspended grief or fear. His son is not dead but he fears for him. He clings to the only hope he has..... The building of the automaton. Catherine is drawn to Henry's notebooks perhaps because she senses this mirroring of feelings.

But then right at the end comes the little twist in the tail.... Who is Karl? Who does he become? What does the automaton foreshadow. Of course this book will be loved by some and rejected by others. It will appeal to those who love detail and intensity of creation and who understand that kind of madness. I guess I am one of those ...... I wish I had the creativity to go with it!

So if you love books that take you to new places - philosophically speaking - that are clever and ambitious and complex be assured you will love this book. If not leave well alone."
The Chemistry of Tears,Catherine Davison,"September 22, 2015",2.0,"I think Peter Carey might just be too clever for me: I really didn't know what was happening at various points in this book. It had a good premise but seemed to descend into pointless obscure tangents unless, as I say, it was very clever and I just missed it through my own ignorance. Were we meant to think Karl Benz had hidden his original plans for the internal combustion engine inside the mechanism of the swan? What were we meant to understand about the old 'Genius' storyteller? What were the copper cables stretching from the Mill house to the ground? Why were they never explained? Did Henry ever get back to his son? What about the map of the town and the stuff about Germany in the third quarter, was all that just ""fill"" ? Or have I just missed a whole lot? Overall I really didn't enjoy this book."
The Chemistry of Tears,Chris Waterford,"February 4, 2023",3.0,"""What a load of rubbish."" So finishes one of the last chapters of this book and it really sums up this novel. The story is promising to start with and I was quite engaged with both Catherine and Henry. Then Henry's story starts to lose its way and soon enough becomes incomprehensible, and Catherine, endeavouring to keep pace with Henry's story, also starts to lose her way and the narrative loses any sense of the coherence it might have started with."
The Chemistry of Tears,Sophie,"May 9, 2012",,"Absolutely stunning story, and beautifully written. Links in strangely well with 'Hugo' (film), and also with 'The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet' in some weird and wonderful way."
The Chemistry of Tears,Kendrick,"July 4, 2021",3.0,"This was a book passed on to me by a work colleague, and I would not normally pick up a book like this. The plot for me unfolds a little bit like James Hogg's Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, in that there are two timelines which parallel each other closely and proceed together as ""counterpoints"" to reveal the truth. The veracity of one timeline is very much suspect, as there are logical inconsistencies and hints of the fabulous involved.

As this is literary fiction, I felt like book's intentions were to evoke feelings and insights, and there are some such insights to be found in the book on the nature of grief and order/disorder in beauty. Unfortunately, I really struggled with the voices of the characters, and with the lack of ""emotional"" depth to each of the character's motivations. One character suffers the death of her beloved, but we rarely see her times of happiness before -- only narrated in brief, quixotic asides. We're left with her anger and sadness, all of which are valid emotions to experience, but are frustrating to the reader. The other ""main"" character quickly becomes washed out by the middle of the story, simply a ""recorder"" of another more strong-willed character and their strange pronouncements about beauty, divinity, and god. Neither are particularly enjoyable to read through.

I have a fond interest in conservation and restoration, and I enjoyed most the parts about restoration and the inner workings of museums, but I think wavering too much on whether to give something 3 or 4 stars really means I should go with the lower rating. It is unfortunate, but I wish I had been introduced to Carey by one of his more successful works.

Smoothly machinated, but no wonder. 3 stars."
The Chemistry of Tears,Anne Mattoni,"July 27, 2022",3.0,"I really liked the story of this book - it contained all of the grief turned work put into an automaton of The Invention of Hugo Cabret as well as the historical mystery of The Liar’s Dictionary. The writing was what threw me, it just felt jolted at points and didn’t always make sense."
The Chemistry of Tears,Tania,"February 26, 2020",1.0,"DNF. I’m a Carey fan, but this does not feel like Carey at all. There are two protagonists that alternate narrative, and both voices are insipid, conveying a drawn out uninspiring story."
