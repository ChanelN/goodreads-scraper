They want to know how they can best raise their children. A common belief today is that nothing can be done to foster the development of healthy heterosexual orientation in children. But the clinical experience and professional research of Dr. Nicolosi and others indicates otherwise.In this groundbreaking book Joseph and Linda Ames Nicolosi uncover the most significant factors that contribute to a child's healthy sense of self as male or female. Listening to moving recollections from ex-homosexual men and women who describe what was missing in their own childhoods, the Nicolosis provide clear insight for identifying potential developmental roadblocks and give practical advice to parents for helping their children securely identify with their gender.Replete with personal stories from parents, children and ex-homosexual strugglers, offers compassion and hope for all those parents who seek to lay a foundation for a healthy heterosexual identity in their children.",Psychology,"September 30, 2002",254,34,556
Coming Out Straight: Understanding and Healing Homosexuality,Richard Cohen,578,1.87,167,"Richard Cohen, a former homosexual, now married with three children, struggled for most of his life with unwanted same-sex attractions. He tried desperately to find professionals who understood his condition and help him heal. Because ""it was so difficult to explain myself to therapists, who didn't have a clue,"" Cohen eventually became a psychotherapist and developed both a groundbreaking understanding of same-sex attractions and a comprehensive treatment plan for healing homosexuality. ""Coming Out Straight"" not only details Cohen's personal journey out of homosexuality but also recounts his experiences helping thousands of men, women and adolescents heal their gender identity. Recoginizing that the ""gay rights movement"" has done a great service in bringing the issue of homosexuality of the closet and into the light, Cohen points out that in the name of tolerance, society has now succumbed to acceptance. ""If we embrace someone's homosexuality as normal and natural, their potential for wholeness will remain dormant beneath their emotional wounds. It's not bad to have same-sex attractions, as they represent a drive to heal unmet love needs. However, acting upon them leads to frustration and pain."" In simple language, ""Coming Out Straight"" presents the basic causes of same-sex attractions, a clear model for recovery, and stories of individuals who made the change. The book has three parts: In Part I, the author shares his own story and the root causes of same-sex attractions. Part II presents a four-stage model of recovery and healing. Part III discusses the healing of homophobia by overcoming fear and hatred of homosexuality. While the book is meant to educate therapists, clergy, and other professionals, it also assists those who struggle with their own same-sex attractions as well as their loved ones. ""Coming Out Straight"" sets forth an easy to understand primer on homosexuality, both for family members and friends of homosexuals, as well as for the general public. It will open the door to a new, happier, and fulfilling heterosexual life.",Psychology,"April 20, 2000",292,13,710

Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,Ivanka Trump,980,2.89,210,"I believe that when it comes to women and work, there isn’t one right answer. The only person who can create a life you’ll love is you.   Our grandmothers fought for the right to work. Our mothers fought for the choice to be in an office or stay at home. Our generation is the first to fully embrace and celebrate the fact our lives are multidimensional. Thanks to the women who came before us and paved the way, we can create the lives we want to lead—which looks different for each of us.   I’ve been fortunate to be able to build my career around my passions, from real estate to fashion. But my professional titles only begin to describe who I am and what I value. I’m an executive and an entrepreneur, but I’m also—and just as importantly—a wife, mother, daughter and friend. To me, “work” encompasses my efforts to succeed in all of these areas.    After appearing on The Apprentice years ago and receiving a flood of letters from young women asking for guidance, I realized the need for more female leaders to speak out publicly in order to change the way society thinks and talks about “women who work.” So I created a forum to do just that. This book evolves the conversation that started, and continues, on IvankaTrump.com, where so many incredible women (and men!) are coming together to share their experiences, advice, ambitions, and passions.   Women who work lead meetings and train for marathons. We learn how to cook and how to code. We inspire our employees and our children. We innovate at our current jobs and start new businesses.    Women Who Work will equip you with the best skills I’ve learned from some of the amazing people I’ve met, on subjects such as identifying opportunities, shifting careers smoothly, negotiating, leading teams, starting companies, managing work and family, and helping change the system to make it better for women—now and in the future. I hope it will inspire you to redefine success and architect a life that honors your individual passions and priorities in a way only you can.",Nonfiction,2017,250,180,"1,004"

The Bible Code,Michael Drosnin,2012,2.86,164,"The Barnes & Noble Review October 1997 The Bible Code is the first full account of a scientific discovery that may change the world, told by a skeptical secular reporter who became part of the story. During Drosnin's five-year investigation of the 3,000-year-old code in the Bible that may reveal our future, he interviewed all the experts, here and abroad. He spent many weeks with the world-class mathematician who discovered the code, Dr. Eliyahu Rips, and he met with famous mathematicians at Harvard, Yale, and Hebrew University. He also talked to a senior code breaker at the top-secret U.S. National Security Agency, who replicated the code and confirmed its messages.  More than just a simple skip code, the Bible code crisscrosses the entire known text of the Bible to find a complex network of words and phrases. For example, after it finds a keyword (""Yitzhak Rabin""), the computer then looks for related information (""assassin,"" ""Amir,"" ""Tel Aviv""). Time after time it finds connected names, dates, and places encoded together. With ""Bill Clinton,"" ""President."" With ""Hitler,"" ""Nazi."" With the moon landing, ""spaceship"" and ""Apollo 11."" A code that has information about significant earthquakes that already happened warns of a major earthquake in Los Angeles early in the next century. It also warns of a nuclear war triggered by an act of nuclear terrorism against Israel.  The Bible code raises a critical question: Does the code describe an inevitable future or a series of possible futures whose ultimate outcome we can still decide? In any event, the Bible code forces us to accept whattheBible itself can only ask us to believe: that we are not alone. As Drosnin states, ""If the Bible code proves one thing, it is that a nonhuman intelligence does exist, or at least did exist at the time the Bible was written. No human could have looked thousands of years ahead and encoded in that ancient book the details of today's world.""",Nonfiction,"January 1, 1997",264,49,839

In an unparalleled literary discovery, previously unknown writings unmask the Jane Austen hidden from history and reveal a writer whose sense and sensibility were more than matched by her knowledge of sex and sensuality. In a pitch-perfect literary parody, Arielle Eckstut and David Auburn claim to have stumbled upon lost manuscript pages from Jane Austen's novels, along with shocking letters to her sister and publisher.

As a child, however, she had none. Growing up as a member of the infamous cult The Children of God, Hough had her own self robbed from her. The cult took her all over the globe--to Germany, Japan, Texas, Ecuador--but it wasn't until her mother finally walked away that Lauren understood she could have a life beyond ""The Family.""Along the way, she's loaded up her car and started over, trading one life for the next. She's taken pilgrimages to the sights of her youth, been kept in solitary confinement, dated a lot of women, dabbled in drugs, and eventually found herself as what she always wanted to be: a writer. Here, as she sweeps through the underbelly of America--relying on friends, family, and strangers alike--she begins to excavate a new identity even as her past continues to trail her and color her world, relationships, and perceptions of self.At once razor-sharp, profoundly brave, and often very, very funny, the essays in Leaving Isn't the Hardest Thing interrogate our notions of ecstasy, queerness, and what it means to live freely.

""She could destroy the world.""____ ""Don't mess around with Empress Theresa!"" says her husband Steve. __ Empress Theresa is what some people would consider impossible, a book about a good girl, with no sex, foul language, or violence, but still giving the reader an action-filled fascinating story. THE BOOK'S INTRODUCTION FOLLOWS What would you do with limitless power? We know what many people in the world would do. History is full of examples. But the world lucks out. It’s Theresa who gets limitless power. Eighteen year old Theresa only wants a quiet life when she’s suddenly burdened with global responsibilities. She is challenged by a series of “impossible” problems. Especially tricky is the one that prompts her to complain, “What am I supposed to do, change the laws of physics? This is the most impossible problem yet.” Can you guess the solutions before reading what Theresa does? Write a book about a decent girl and some critics will say every character must have serious flaws. I might have made Theresa another kind of personality, a less desirable and troubled kind of girl which would satisfy certain critics, but then people would come at me with a noose complaining, “This was our only chance to see a super-powerful girl in action and you messed up. Why didn’t you give us a loveable, inspiring Theresa?” I did, but I didn’t overdo it. A girl as fine as Theresa can be found in any high school. You know one. Empress Theresa is a tribute to the common, decent human being who quietly builds the world but hasn’t gotten enough attention lately.

To Train Up a Child,Michael Pearl,1812,2.86,347,"Three thousand years ago, a wise man said, “Train up a child in the way that he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it.”  Good training is not crisis management; it is what you do before the need of discipline arises.Most parenting is accidental rather than deliberate.  Imagine building a house that way.  We don’t need to reinvent training.  There are child training principles and methods that have worked from antiquity.  To neglect deliberate training is to shove your child into a sea of choices and passions without a boat of compass.This book is not about discipline, nor problem children.  The emphasis is on the training of a child before the need to discipline arises.  It is apparent that, though they expect obedience, most parents never attempt to train their child to obey.  They wait until the behavior becomes unbearable and then explode.  With proper training, discipline can be reduced to 5% of what many now practice.  As you come to understand the difference between training and discipline, you will have a renewed vision for your family, no more raised voices, no contention, no bad attitudes, fewer spankings, a cheerful atmosphere in the home and total obedience from your children.",Parenting,"August 1, 1994",122,95,"1,033"

Pamela,Samuel Richardson,11977,2.77,1104,"One of the most spectacular successes of the flourishing literary marketplace of eighteenth-century London, Pamela also marked a defining moment in the emergence of the modern novel. In the words of one contemporary, it divided the world into two different Parties, Pamelists and Anti-pamelists, even eclipsing the sensational factional politics of the day. Preached for its morality, and denounced as pornography in disguise, it vividly describes a young servant's long resistance to the attempts of her predatory master to seduce her. Written in the voice of its low-born heroine, Pamela is not only a work of pioneering psychological complexity, but also a compelling and provocative study of power and its abuse.Based on the original text of 1740, from which Richardson later retreated in a series of defensive revisions, this edition makes available the version of Pamela that aroused such widespread controversy on its first appearance.",Classics,"January 1, 1740",592,699,"9,353"

The Clansman,Thomas Dixon Jr.,305,2.63,79,"""The first thing to be said in discussing Thomas Dixon, Jr.'s novel The Clansman is that no person of critical judgment thinks of it as having artistic conception or literary craftsmanship."" - Historian Thomas D. ClarkThe year was 1865. With the close of the Civil War, there began for the South an era of even greater turmoil. In The Clansman, his controversial 1905 novel, later the basis of the motion picture The Birth of a Nation, Thomas Dixon, describes the social, political, and economic disintegration that plagued the South during Reconstruction, depicting the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the reactions of two families to racial conflict. This study in social history was alternatively praised and damned by contemporary critics.As historian Thomas D. Clark notes in his introduction, the novel ""opened wider a vein of racial hatred which was to poison further an age already in social and political upheaval. Dixon had in fact given voice in his novel to one of the most powerful latent forces in the social and political mind of the South."" For modern readers, The Clansman probes the roots of the racial violence that still haunts our society.This critical edition places the controversial novel in context with the history of the Ku Klux Klan, discrimination, and Jim Crow laws. By detailing the economic plight of the South in the late nineteenth century and Dixon's background, Clark reveals how easily prejudice took hold amongst Southern whites.",Fiction,"January 1, 1905",374,77,659
